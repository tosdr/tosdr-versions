Terms and conditions of license
-------------------------------

Please read these Terms of Service carefully because they are a binding agreement between you and Trivie, Inc. (“Trivie” or “We”). These Terms of Service govern your use of the Site (defined below) and any other websites that link to these Terms of Service and the services offered on or through those websites, and our Software (defined below).  By using the Site or Software, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Statement. These Terms of Service and any related purchase order, statement of work, quotation order, signed invoice, and/or letter agreement collectively constitute an agreement (the “Agreement”). Please note that this Agreement contemplates a license of the Software, not a sale. You have no ownership rights in the Software or Documentation, and your rights to access and use the Software and Documentation are limited to those rights expressly set forth herein.

Your Account
------------

You may be required to create an account and specify a password in order to use the Software and certain services or features on the Site. Account registration requires you to submit certain personal information, that may or may not include such information such as your name, address, mobile phone number, and other information. To create an account, you must be at least 18 years old, and you must provide truthful and accurate information about yourself. If your information changes at any time, please update your account to reflect those changes.  
  
The Software and Service features and functionalities available to you are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between Trivie and you or the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into a separate agreement (collectively “Customer”) that governs delivery, access, and use of the Software and Service.  In some cases, an account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using or logging into an account assigned to you by an administrator, additional terms may apply to your use of the Software and Sites. Moreover, your administrator may be able to access or disable your account without our involvement.  
You may not share your account with anyone else. Please keep your password confidential. If you believe that your account has been compromised at any time, please notify your system administrator.

Fees
----

Fees. In consideration for the rights granted under this Agreement, Customer shall pay Trivie the license fee for the usage limits set forth in the Order Form (“Fee”), which amounts shall be paid up front for the entire Initial Term. Unless otherwise set forth in the Order Form, all payments under this Agreement are to be in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If Customer’s use of the Software exceeds the usage limits set forth on the Order Form, or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the terms of this Agreement), Trivie will invoice Customer in arrears for such additional usage and Customer agrees to pay the additional Fees in the manner provided herein. If you choose to set up your corporate account to electronically pay the Fee, you will also be required to provide a valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You grant us the right to provide any information you submit to us to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of any monetary transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Unless you provide written notice of non-renewal, your account will be charged the Fee for the next renewal term. If you cancel before the upcoming renewal date, you will not be charged the Fee for the renewal term. If Trivie has granted access to all or certain portions of the Software free of charge for evaluation purposes or to a beta version free of charge for testing purposes, continued use following any evaluation or testing period may result in charges for such continued use. If such charges are not specified in an applicable Order Form, Trivie will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such charges and the option to cancel any continued use rather than pay the charges.  
  
Taxes. All amounts payable hereunder shall exclude all applicable sales, use and other taxes and all applicable export and import fees, customs duties and similar charges. Unless Customer provides evidence of non-profit status, Customer will be responsible for payment of all such taxes (other than taxes based on Trivie’s income), if any, fees, duties and charges, and any related penalties and interest, arising hereunder.  
  
Disputed Charges. Any payment dispute shall be notified in writing to the other Party within thirty days of any such payment. Payments shall be calculated based on records maintained by Trivie.  
  
Late Payment. Any undisputed payment not received within thirty days after the due date will accrue interest at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law. If Customer is more than fifteen days delinquent in its payments, Trivie may, upon written notice to Customer, modify the payment terms to require advance payment for the full amount of the fees for the remainder of the Term, suspend Customer’s access to the Software, and/or require other assurances to secure Customer’s payment obligations due hereunder.

Grant of license
----------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Trivie grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the Software and the Documentation, provided that you do not (and do not allow any third party to): (i) modify, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, reverse assemble, or otherwise attempt to discover any source code of the Software; (ii) sell, rent, sublicense, lease, loan, adapt, edit, or modify the Software or the Documentation; or (iii) create any derivative works from the Software.

This Agreement will be effective as of the date set forth in an applicable Order Form (“Effective Date”). Unless otherwise set forth in the Order Form, the license shall begin on the Effective Date and will continue for twelve months (“Initial Term”), unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement, and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms, unless you provide written notice of non-renewal at least thirty days before the end of the then-current term (the Initial Term, together with any renewal terms, collectively, the “Term”). Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time as follows, unless another commercial contract is in place between the parties: (i) immediately upon written notice to the other party, only in the event of a material breach by the other party of the confidentiality or intellectual property ownership terms set forth herein; (ii) upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach by the other party of any terms and conditions of this Agreement other than as set forth in subsection (i) above, including (without limitation) for failure to pay fees due to Trivie under this Agreement, and the failure to cure such material breach during such 30-day period; and/or (iii) immediately in the event that the other party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or commences or has commenced against it any proceeding in bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization pursuant to bankruptcy laws or laws of debtor's moratorium. In addition, Trivie reserves the right to deny you access to the Software if you (a) have failed, within five days after receipt of written notice requesting payment, to pay all sums due under this Agreement that are not reasonably disputed by you; or (b) are otherwise in default or breach of a material provision of this Agreement.

As soon as practicable following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, but not longer than 30 days, each party shall return to the other party all property belonging to or owned by such other party, including, but not limited to, its Confidential Information and all copies thereof (or, at the request of a party, shall certify in writing the destruction thereof) and, in the case of Trivie, its Documentation. Following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, you shall have no further access to the Site or use of the Software.
