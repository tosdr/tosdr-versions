**2\. How We Collect Information**  
We collect some information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form or when you talk with our customer support team. We and third parties also use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.  
  
A. Cookies and Similar Technologies  
Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or the guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.  
  
We use also other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our products and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our products, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement. Other examples include HTML 5 cookies, Silverlight Application Storage, device fingerprints and "flash cookies." If you want to remove flash cookies or prevent them from being placed, adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. We may adopt a DNT standard if one is established. In the meantime, you may opt out of certain types of tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing your cookie settings.  
  
We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat and Anti-Fraud technologies in our products that utilize the same cookies and similar mechanisms. These technologies are described below.  
  
B. Analytics Technologies  
We use our own servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our products, your computer or device and the health of our products.  
  
For instance, Playata may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our products. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in section 3, below. If you play a game offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to Playata when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online services, Playata also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.  
  
Third party analytics services integrated into our products may combine the information they collect in connection with Playata's services with information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A representative list of third party analytics companies that operate in our products can be found at [Appendix](https://us5.bigbangempire.com/policy/appendix.php).  
  
C. Advertising Serving Technologies  
Some of our products employ advertising serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might receive an advertisement later for that game or similar products from Playata GmbH or third party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable advertising to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.  
  
These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:  
  
– Advertisements served and the location of the ad;  
– Length of time an advertisement was visible;  
– Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and  
– Advertisement response.  
  
Third party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Products and Services with other information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A representative list of advertising serving companies that operate their own networks on our sites and online and/or mobile products and/or services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at [Appendix](https://us5.bigbangempire.com/policy/appendix.php).  
  
To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit [https://www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/), [https://www.aboutads.info/choices/,](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/,) [http://youradchoices.ca/,](http://youradchoices.ca/,) or [https://www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.  
  
D. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies  
Playata strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our products, set up an Playata Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.

We do not control information sent from your browser to third parties, such as advertising networks and analytics companies that receive information in the normal course of your Internet activity.
