For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Your Information" means information about you, which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally identifying information, medical and health history information, and/or financial information.

This Privacy Policy applies to our Use of Your Information as a result of you using our Services, and does not apply to the following: (a) information collected through mediums other than our Services; (b) information collected through our Services where a separate privacy policy applies, such as a sweepstakes entry (you should refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry); or (c) information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our Services (such as a third-party website, application, widget or lead form).

In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by our Terms of Use and any other documents referred to in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. These documents describe information that we collect from you or that you provide on or to the Services and how Your Information may be used and disclosed by us. They also describe the choices available to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use carefully.

Maine: You have the right of free choice in the selection of the agent and insurer through or by which insurance in connection with a loan is to be placed.
