**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

We collect information when you choose to share it with us on our Websites, such as signing up for newsletters or opting in to receive information from us. For example, you may choose to send us information about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on one of our Websites or to utilize our services as a Publisher or an Advertiser. We use this information to contact you to respond to an inquiry, and in some instances, certain parts of our Websites require requested information for you to participate in programs and services. We also collect information when you sign up as an Account Holder. Account Holders include both Advertisers and Publishers who have been qualified and approved for access to our Advertising Technology Products. Account Holder information collected includes information necessary to conduct business including, but not limited to, account holder name, phone number, email address, and/or tax ID number. Payments made to and/or from Inuvo require the provision of and specified collection of additional information which may include, but is not limited to, bank account information and credit card numbers. Phone, facsimile, email, and/or cell numbers may be used to contact Account Holders as needed.

All Account Holder information collected is maintained in a password-protected environment. This information is used for client/customer service, media delivery, contact, billing-payables and receivables, and/or other reporting purposes. Account Holders may change, update or add additional information about themselves by contacting their account representative.

We also collect additional information via our Websites and our Advertising Technology Products, such as the following:

* Cookies. We use “cookies.”  The cookies we place on your computer are very small text files that uniquely identify your browser and may be sent to your computer or mobile device. They are stored on your hard drive and communicate to our servers only when you are visiting our Websites or a Publisher website utilizing one of our Advertising Technology Products. You are always free to decline cookies. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. For more information about cookies and web beacons, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/.
* Device Information. We collect information regarding the Internet browser, computer, tablet, mobile phone, smartphone, or other device utilized to access our Websites or Advertising Technology Products.
* Internet Protocol Addresses. Internet browsers automatically transmit information such as the URL of the Website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version of your computer.
* Location Information. On some of our mobile applications we may (or may enable a third party to) request your geolocation information. If allowed, we (or the third party) may use this information to supply you with location-specific advertisements, offers, and functionality. Additionally, we may (or may enable a third party to) capture geolocation information (such as IP address data) when you access our Websites or via our Advertising Technology Products, and may use that geo-location information to targets ads, offers, and functionality.
* Analytics. We use third-party information, reports, and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of Internet users. We allow the third-party analytics companies to include web beacons and cookies on certain of our Websites and in some of our Advertising Technology Products. The collected information includes search terms, search parameters, click-throughs by users, and other similar information.
* Log Files. We may also automatically log certain anonymous information about visitors to our Websites, including, but not limited to, where the user came from to visit our site, IP address, search terms utilized, browser type, and a reading history of the pages viewed.

* Other. As new technologies develop we may implement and/or test them on our Websites or in our Advertising Technology. We only utilize technologies as permitted by law.

We use the information we collect via our Websites for five basic purposes.

1. The first is to improve and customize the content and advertisements on our Websites, this includes items such as ensuring our sites and content are viewable and in the appropriate language.
2. The second is to “frequency cap” ad campaigns that we administer. Frequency capping controls the number of times you are exposed to an ad, which results in a better experience for you and the advertiser.
3. The third is to serve appropriate promotions from advertisers if you have expressed an implied interest by visiting that advertiser’s site (known as “retargeting”).
4. The fourth way is for Interest-Based Advertising (IBA), which uses consumer data to infer intent. We retain this data for 60 days, after which the data is aggregated and maintained for an additional two years solely for reporting purposes.
5. The fifth way is for business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, record keeping, and contractual compliance. While we also use information in a limited fashion for the administration and operation of our Websites, it is used primarily to improve the overall quality of experience with the information we provide on our Websites.

**PUBLIC FORUMS**

Some of our Websites make chat rooms, polls, surveys, forums, message boards, blogs commentary, and/or news groups available to users.

When you assert your right to request information, you must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, which may include confirmation that you are a resident of the State of California. We reserve the right to request that you provide further evidence as a resident of California before acting on your request. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process and must (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

To opt out of this site selling any of the information it collects about you to third parties and to delete all such information, we offer an “Opt-Out” Option, which can be accessed via the following page: [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/).

**Non-Discrimination**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that **can result** in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

**USERS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES**

Visitors to our Websites from outside the United States will have their data transferred to and stored in our servers in the U.S. By using our Websites, international users are acknowledging and/or consenting to, to the extent possible, our use and collection of their data as described herein.

**The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

Effective May 25, 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) will be in effect through the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. The GDPR requires us to provide users in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK with certain information about the processing of their “Personal Data.” “Personal Data” is a term used under the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, cookie identifiers, precise location data, and biometric data.

_Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data_

The legal grounds for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy will typically be because:

* _You provided your consent._ On certain occasions, we rely on the consent of the individual to process Personal Data (for example, when the user inputs Personal Information into our Websites). We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and its withdrawal;
* _The processing is in our legitimate interest._ In some cases, we rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data, in order to provide our and/or other data controllers’ services. We also rely on legitimate interest when we use Personal Data to maintain the security of our services, such as to detect fraud or to ensure that bugs are detected and fixed;
* _Contractual relationships._ Sometimes, we process certain data as necessary under a contractual relationship we have (such as our customer records and contact information);
* _Legal obligations._ Finally, some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.

_Transfers of Personal Data_

We are based in the US, and the information is processed on our servers in the US and other jurisdictions. When we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data.

_Your Rights as a Data Subject_

The GDPR provides you with the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the operation of our business. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the operation of our business. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.

To exercise any of these rights, contact us as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Further, if we are processing your information on behalf of one of our clients, we will refer you to that client, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.

If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority.

_Data Controller and a Data Processor_

EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). If you have a question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, we encourage you to direct your inquiry to the relevant data controller, since data controllers hold primary responsibility for your Personal Data.

We may act as either a data controller or a data processor in handling your Personal Data, depending on the precise circumstances. For instance, for Personal Data that we collect from Account Holders, we are a data controller. But when we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our Publishers in order to provide our services to them we are a data processor. Thus, for instance, if you have questions about data that is collected and used primarily by Publishers you should contact those Publishers directly regarding questions about the Personal Data they handle and control.
