    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, **_send_space** makes certain Services available to User. For the purposes of this Agreement:
    
    1. "User" (or "you") means the individual or business entity that is using or registering to use the Services, including its employees and agents;
    2. **_send_space** "Services" means those electronic or interactive services offered by **_send_space**. **_send_space** reserves the right to change or discontinue any of the Services at any time.

Elements of the Web site are protected by trade dress and other laws and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part. **_send_space**, the **_send_space** logo and other **_send_space** products referenced herein are trademarks of **_send_space**, and may be registered in certain jurisdictions. All other product names, company names, marks, logos, and symbols may be the trademarks of their respective owners.
    
3. **3\. User Information**
    ========================
    
    User represents and warrants that the information it provides in **_send_space** contact information forms is true, accurate, current and complete. User agrees to maintain and update this information to ensure that it is true, accurate, current and complete. If, at any time, any information provided by User is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, **_send_space** will have the right to suspend or terminate User's account and this Agreement.

Accounts cannot be transferred or used by anyone other than the User and authorized account sub-users. **_send_space** may suspend or terminate the account of Users who share their account with anyone other than the user and authorized account sub-users. Knowingly using a registered account assigned to another person is a violation of **_send_space**'s terms of use. In addition to violating this policy, the sharing of accounts, passwords or usernames could result in unauthorised activity for which the authorised user will be held responsible. All Users are responsible for the actions of their authorized account sub-users and agree to ensure that their authorized account sub-users abide by the rules set forth in these terms. You must immediately notify **_send_space** if you have any suspicion or reason to believe that your account, username and/or password have been misused in any way.

User bears full responsibility for archiving its data and sole liability for any lost or irrecoverable data. User agrees to maintain its data in compliance with its legal obligations. **_send_space** will delete User data upon termination of this Agreement. However, **_send_space** may retain User data in its archives after deletion and will not be liable to User in any way for such retained data.
