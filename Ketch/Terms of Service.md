Terms of Service
================

#### Last updated and effective as of: September 5, 2024

This Master Service Agreement (the ‚Äú**MSA**‚Äù) is entered into between Customer and Ketch. ‚Äú**Customer**‚Äù means the entity on behalf of which this MSA is accepted or, if that does not apply, the individual accepting this MSA. ‚Äú**Ketch**‚Äù means Ketch Kloud, Inc. ¬†This MSA is effective as of the date of the first Order Form between the parties, or as of the date which Customer first creates an account with Ketch, whichever is earliest (the ‚Äú**Effective Date**‚Äù). ¬†The ‚Äú**Agreement**‚Äù means this MSA together with all incorporated contracts, associated Order Forms, and the [DPA](https://www.ketch.com/data-processing-addendum).  
  
If you (the person accepting this MSA) are doing so on behalf of your employer or another entity, you agree that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this MSA, and (ii) you agree to this MSA on behalf of your employer or such entity. ¬†  
  
If you are accepting this MSA using an email address from your employer or another entity, then: (i) you will be deemed to represent that party, (ii) your acceptance of this MSA will bind your employer or that entity to these terms, and (iii) the word ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚ÄúCustomer‚Äù in this MSA will refer to your employer or that entity. ¬†  
  
By clicking on the ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you at the time of placing an Order Form or creating an account, or by using or accessing the Services, you confirm you are bound by this MSA. ¬†If you do not wish to be bound by this MSA, do not click ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù (or similar button or checkbox), create an account, or use or access the Services.  
  
A glossary of defined terms can be found at the end of this MSA. ¬†  
  
The parties agree as follows: ¬†  
  
**1\.** **Ketch Responsibilities  
  
**1.1. Ketch will make the Services available to Customer pursuant to the terms of any Order Form between the parties and in accordance with this Agreement.  
  
1.2. Ketch will maintain appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Customer Data, including measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Customer Data (other than by Customer‚Äôs personnel). ¬†Both parties shall comply with the terms of the [DPA](https://www.ketch.com/data-processing-addendum), which is incorporated into and made part of the Agreement. Thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this MSA, Ketch will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data.  
  
1.3. Each party will take all steps reasonably necessary to enable the other party to comply (or demonstrate its compliance) with applicable privacy laws and regulations (including providing needed documentation).  
  
1.4. The Services, Documentation, and any other communication or information provided by Ketch are not legal advice and are not intended to be perceived as legal advice. ¬†Customer shall seek its own legal counsel for any matters requiring legal advice. ¬† ¬†  
  
**2\.** **Customer Responsibilities.  
  
**2.1. Customer shall comply with this Agreement, the Documentation, and all applicable laws and regulations. ¬†Customer shall comply with the terms of service or similar policies of any Third-Party Application with which Customer uses the Services. Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services and shall notify Ketch promptly of any such unauthorized access or use. Customer is responsible for its personnel‚Äôs and agents‚Äô compliance with Customer‚Äôs obligations under this Agreement.  
  
2.2. Customer is responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Data, the means by which Customer acquired Customer Data, and its use of Customer Data with the Services or any Third-Party App. Customer will ensure that all necessary rights and permissions are established for the transfer and/or processing of Customer Data in connection with the Services or the applicable Third-Party App in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and self-regulatory requirements.  
  
2.3. Customer shall not (a) make any part of the Services available to, or use the Services for the benefit of, any third party; (b) sell, resell, license, sublicense, distribute, make available, rent, or lease the Services; (c) modify, copy, or create derivative works of the Services (or any part thereof); (d) disassemble, reverse-engineer, or decompile the Services; (e) access the Services for purposes of monitoring their availability, performance, or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes; (f) use the Services or any Third-Party Application to store or transmit materials that are unlawful, misleading, libelous, obscene, hateful, or violative of others' privacy rights; (g) introduce viruses or other malware to a Third-Party Application or the Services, Ketch's systems, or end users; or (h) use the Services or any Third-Party Application in a manner that violates its agreement with any third party or could reasonably be expected to damage the Services or Third-Party Application or reflect unfavorably on the reputation of Ketch or its partners. Customer will not export, re-export, or transfer the Services, in whole or in part, to any country, person, or entity subject to U.S. export restrictions.  
  
**3\.** **Payment and Taxes**.  
  
3.1. Customer will pay all fees specified in Order Forms or otherwise agreed to via the Platform. ¬†If paying by credit card, Customer will promptly provide credit card billing details and hereby authorizes Ketch to charge the credit card for Services. Ketch reserves the right to charge interest on late payments at the lower of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum permitted by law. Ketch's fees do not include any present or future taxes, levies, fees or duties of any kind ("**Taxes**"). Except for any Tax that Ketch has charged to Customer, Customer is responsible for remitting all Taxes based on or arising from this Agreement (other than Taxes based on Ketch's net income), without setoff or deduction from the fees. If Ketch is held responsible for such Taxes, Customer will reimburse Ketch for such payments.  
  
**4\.** **Data, Proprietary Rights, and Licenses.  
  
**4.1. Customer grants Ketch a worldwide, limited-term right and license to host, copy, use, transmit, and display Customer Data as appropriate for Ketch to provide and ensure proper operation of the Services and associated systems in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to the limited licenses granted herein, Ketch acquires no right, title, or interest from Customer under this Agreement in or to any Customer Data.  
  
4.2. Subject to the limited rights expressly granted herein, Ketch reserves all of its right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Services, and, as between Ketch and Customer, Ketch owns all system performance metrics, any identifiers created or sourced by Ketch, and any other data within or related to the Services that is not Customer Data (collectively, "**Ketch Data**"). Ketch reserves all of its right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to Ketch Data, and Customer may only use Ketch Data during the Term and as necessary to use the Services as permitted by this Agreement, and may not export Ketch Data. ¬†  
  
4.3. Customer acknowledges that the Services may engage in machine learning, including the use of algorithms or other methods that may be trained by exposure to Customer Data, and that the results and output of such learning, which results and outputs will contain no Customer Data, are Ketch Data. Ketch may track and analyze usage of the Services for purposes of security and improving the Services, and Customer will not restrict Ketch from improving or creating services on the basis of general learning and know-how gained from the provision of the Services. Ketch may use any suggestions or feedback from Customer perpetually and irrevocably without accounting, attribution, or compensation.  
  
4.4. Ketch may collect, produce, use, or retain aggregated or other deidentified data generated from Customer Data or Customer's use of the Services (e.g., to create reports on industry or end user trends), provided that such data does not identify, or is not reasonably capable of identifying, Customer or any individual or household. Such data and reports are Ketch Data.  
‚Äç  
**5\. Privacy.  
  
**5.1. Each party will take all steps reasonably necessary to enable the other party to comply (or demonstrate its compliance) with applicable privacy laws and regulations (including providing needed documentation).  
  
5.2. Customer will conspicuously post and comply with a legally sufficient privacy notice on its properties where data is collected and used in association with the Services. The privacy notice must accurately describe Customer's practices relating to data collection, sharing, and use.  
  
**5.3.** **CCPA Service Provider Disclosure**. In light of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended from time to time, including as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, the "CCPA") and to ensure that adequate contractual terms are in place between the parties to comply with the CCPA, the parties acknowledge and agree that, in its provision of the Services, Ketch will act as Customer's service provider in processing Personal Information on behalf of Customer.  
  
1\. For purposes of this section 5.3: (i) "commercial purpose," "personal information," "sell," and, "service provider" have the meanings given to them in the CCPA and (ii) "Personal Information," with respect to the information of California consumers, has the meaning given in the CCPA to "personal information," but specifically any Customer Data constituting personal information.  
  
2\. With respect to the Services, except as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, Ketch is prohibited from: (i) selling Personal Information and (ii) retaining, using, or disclosing Personal Information other than (a) for a business purpose under the CCPA on behalf of Customer and the specific purpose of performing the Services, as further described in the Documentation, or as otherwise permitted under the CCPA, or (b) as may otherwise be permitted for service providers or under a comparable exemption from "sale" in the CCPA, as reasonably determined by Ketch. Ketch may, however, disclose the Personal Information to its own service providers, if any, where Ketch has carried out adequate due diligence on each such service provider and included terms in the contract between Ketch and such service provider that are equivalent to those set out in this section 5.3.  
  
3\. Ketch shall promptly and in good faith take such actions and provide such information and assistance as Customer may reasonably request and as directly related to the Services to enable Customer to honor requests of individuals to exercise their rights under the CCPA.  
  
**6\.** **Third Party Applications.  
  
**6.1. The Services may offer Customer the ability to connect to or integrate with other software not owned or operated by Ketch (‚Äú**Third-Party Applications**‚Äù). ¬†Ketch cannot guarantee the continued availability of any Third-Party Application and is not responsible for the interoperation of Third-Party Applications with the Services. Any use by Customer of Third-Party Applications, and any exchange of data between Customer and any Third-Party Application provider, is solely between Customer and the applicable Third-Party Application provider. If Customer chooses to use a Third-Party Application with the Services, Customer grants Ketch permission to allow the Third-Party Application and its provider to access Customer Data and information about Customer‚Äôs usage of the Third-Party Application as appropriate for the interoperation of that Third-Party Application with the Services. Ketch is not responsible for any act or omission by a Third-Party Application, including, without limitation, any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data transmitted to, or accessed by, a Third-Party Application. If Customer receives notice that a Third-Party Application must be removed, modified or disabled in connection with applicable laws or third-party rights, Customer will promptly do so. If Customer does not do so, or if Ketch reasonably believes that a violation of applicable laws or third-party rights is likely to occur or continue, Ketch may disable the Services‚Äô ability to interoperate with such Third-Party Application.  
  
**7\.** **Confidentiality**. ¬†  
  
**7.1.** ‚Äú**Confidential Information**‚Äù means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances and the type of information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality or (d) is independently developed without use of the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information. The receiving party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the disclosing party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information to those of its and its affiliates‚Äô employees and contractors, and, in the case of Ketch with a Third-Party Application provider, who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the receiving party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). The terms of the Agreement will be Confidential Information of both parties.  
  
7.2. It is expressly agreed that a remedy at law for breach of the obligations relating to confidential information is inadequate and that, in addition to any other remedies permitted by this Agreement, each party is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent the breach, threatened breach, or continued breach thereof.  
  
**8\.** **Mutual Indemnity**. ¬†  
  
8.1. Ketch will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer and its officers, directors, employees and representatives from any Liabilities arising out of any unaffiliated third-party claim that the Services in the form made available by Ketch infringe such third party's intellectual-property rights.  
  
8.2. Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ketch and its officers, directors, employees and representatives from any Liabilities arising out of any unaffiliated third-party claim arising out of or from Customer Data or any other Customer information or materials, any Third-Party Application, or Customer's violation of applicable laws or regulations or infringement of the intellectual-property or other rights of a third party.  
  
8.3. Each party's indemnification obligations are conditioned on (a) the indemnified party providing the indemnitor with prompt written notice of any claim (provided that the failure to promptly notify will only relieve the indemnitor of its obligation to the extent it can demonstrate material prejudice from such failure), (b) the indemnitor having sole control and authority with respect to the defense and settlement of any such claim, and (c) the indemnified party cooperating fully with the indemnitor, at the indemnitor's sole cost and expense. The indemnitor will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, agree to any settlement of any such claim that does not include a complete release of the indemnified party from all liability or that imposes any liability, obligation or restriction on the indemnified party. The indemnified party may participate with its own counsel, at its own expense. This section 8 states the indemnifying party's sole liability to, and the indemnified party's exclusive remedy against, the other party for any third party claim described in this section.  
  
8.4. Ketch will have no obligation for claims arising out of or from (a) Services that are modified by Ketch in compliance with Customer's specifications, (b) the combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Ketch, where the cause of action would not have arisen but for such combination, (c) the unauthorized adaptation or modification of the Services, where the cause of action would not have arisen but for such adaptation or modification, (d) Customer's failure to follow instructions provided by Ketch which would have cured the cause of action, provided that following such instructions would not have caused Customer substantial, additional cost, (e) use of the Services other than as described in the Agreement or Documentation, (f) Customer's breach of this Agreement, or (e) Customer's continued use of a version of the Services other than the most recently released version, where the cause of action would not have arisen if such most recently released version had been used. If any of the subsections above apply, Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Ketch and its officers, directors, employees and representatives from and against any Liabilities arising out of such claims.  
  
8.5. If the Services are held in a suit or proceeding to infringe any intellectual-property or other rights of a third party, or Ketch reasonably believes that it is likely to be found to do so, then Ketch may, at its sole cost, expense and option, either (a) procure the right to continue using the Services or (b) modify the Services so that they become non-infringing without affecting the basic functionality of the Services; provided, however, that if (a) and (b) are not practicable, Ketch may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable portion of the Services by giving Customer 30 days' written notice, upon which termination Ketch will refund the portion of any prepayment that reflects the remaining subscription term.  
  
**9\.** **Term, Termination, and Renewal.  
  
**9.1. The **Term** of the Agreement commences on the Effective Date and terminates upon the expiry or termination of all associated Order Forms, or, if no Order Forms are ever created, upon the date Customer‚Äôs access to the Services is removed. ¬†  
  
9.2. Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form, either party may terminate this Agreement and any Order Form immediately if (a) the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (b) the other party is in material breach of this Agreement, has been given notice of such material breach, and has failed to cure within 30 days (or 5 days in the case of failure to pay fees as described in this Agreement). If this Agreement or an Order Form is terminated for Customer‚Äôs uncured breach, Customer will promptly pay any minimum amounts that would have been due for the full duration of the Term as it existed prior to the early termination. Ketch may suspend access to and use of the Services if Ketch reasonably believes that Customer‚Äôs continuing use of the Services may cause risk of litigation or otherwise be harmful to Ketch. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer‚Äôs right to use the Services will terminate, and Customer will promptly return (or at Ketch‚Äôs election, delete) Ketch‚Äôs Confidential Information (including any Ketch Data).  
  
9.3. Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, all Order Forms will automatically renew for additional one (1) year periods, unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the relevant subscription term. ¬†Ketch may increase the pricing during any renewal term up to 10% above the list price in the prior term. ¬†  
  
**10\.** **Notices**.  
  
10.1 Notices must be in writing and are effective when (a) delivered personally or (b) sent by email to the address provided in this Agreement (the email associated with the Free Account or listed on the latest Order Form for Customer, and [legal@ketch.com](mailto:legal@ketch.com) for Ketch) if the sending party does not receive an error notice and the email includes in the subject line "LEGAL NOTICE." For the avoidance of doubt, if the sending party receives an error notice because the receiving party has changed its email address without formally notifying the sending party, the email notice is deemed effective if the sending party is using the last email address provided by the other party for the express purpose of receiving notices.
