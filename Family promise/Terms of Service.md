In addition, the user is responsible for any state or local sales taxes associated with the Services or product offerings purchased.

If you sign up for a recurring donation, you authorize FP (and/or its payment processing vendors) to charge your chosen payment provider according to the terms of the plan to which you subscribe. The subscription period and the amount and frequency of the charges or payments will vary depending on donation plan you select.

Some FP recurring donations will continue indefinitely until cancelled by the user. After your initial donation commitment period, and again after any subsequent donation period, your recurring donation will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period as the donation term you originally selected and at the donation rate and frequency disclosed to you on the Site when you originally agreed to make recurring donations, unless otherwise provided at the time you subscribed. If you sign up for a payment plan that allows you to be charged monthly over donation period and you decide to cancel your donation during the period, you acknowledge and agree that you will continue to be billed for the donation on a monthly basis until its originally scheduled expiration date.

All payments for products and all donations are non-refundable Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a recurring donation agreement that is automatically renewed, we will refund the most recent charge to your credit card if you cancel your donation within thirty (30) days after the most recent charge, The refund will apply to the most recent charge only.
