**8\. By Providing Content, We Do Not Allow You to Use Our Trademarks**

The trademarks, service marks and logos of Lockheed Martin" used and displayed on our Web site are our registered and unregistered trademarks.  Nothing on this Web site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any of our trademarks without our written permission. Requests to use trademarks owned by other companies which may be mentioned on this Web site should be directed to such other companies. We aggressively enforce our intellectual property rights. The name of Lockheed Martin Corporation or our logo may not be used in any way, including in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of materials on our Web site, without prior written permission. You are not authorized to use our logo as a hyperlink to our Web site unless you obtain our written permission in advance.

**9\. We Are Not Providing Investment Advice Nor Soliciting Offers**

Nothing in this site constitutes investment advice, including our SEC filings. We provide investor relations materials for your convenience and information only. In addition, investor relations materials and our other Web site content are not offers to sell or solicitations of an offer to buy any security.

All investors should know that there are "ups" and "downs" in every business and stock. There are no guarantees about the future performance of the stock market or our stock. Before you invest in any security, you can protect yourself by being an educated investor. If you are interested in our stock, we recommend that, at a minimum, you read our latest annual report and 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC over the past year.

**10\. You Should Not Rely on the Stock Price Information on Our Web Site**

We do not generate the information regarding Lockheed Martin Corporation stock prices for our Web site.

**11\. Investors Should Not Rely on Forward-Looking Information**

Some of the statements on our Web Site, including those relating to projected future financial performance or events, are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, specifically the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our expectations or forecasts of future events. Sometimes these statements will use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "outlook," "forecast," and other similar words. These statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual performance to be materially different from those we project.

Our actual results will be different due to the inherent nature of projections and may be better or worse than projected. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they initially were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to any forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, to reflect events or circumstances or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events after the date they initially were made.

In addition to the factors set forth in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following factors could affect the forward- looking statements: the ability to achieve or quantify savings for our customers or ourselves through our global cost-cutting program and other financial management programs; the ability to obtain, or the timing of obtaining, future government awards and contracts; the availability of government funding and customer requirements; changes in government priorities due to program reviews or revisions to strategic objectives; difficulties in developing and producing operationally advanced technology systems; the competitive environment; economic, business and political conditions domestically and internationally; the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries and launches; the outcome of contingencies, including litigation, environmental remediation, program performance, and completion of any acquisitions and divestitures. These are only some of the numerous factors which may affect the forward-looking statements contained on our Web Site.
