Privacy policy



This disclaimer/privacy policy notification is subject to change without notice.

Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains our approach to privacy on all ourMinuteInbox websites and how it affects you.



Short version



 We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.



 Some 3rd parties like Facebook, Google and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you

use their services. We can’t control them but we don’t believe this knowledge poses anythreat to you.



 If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we’ll never share

it with others without your express permission.



 We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.

These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.



Measuring our visitors



We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view withinour site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of thatinformation is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well,how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make ourwebsite better.

You can learn more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.



Facebook, Twitter and other social networks

These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our website – such as the

“Like” and “Tweet” buttons.



To do so we embed code that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their

buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friendslike this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networksuse it.

Social networks therefore could know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (thatisn’t to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is remarkably inoffensive weimagine this is not a concern for most users.



Discussion comments



We do not use any discussion system like a Disqus.



If you sign up for a service



You do not need to sign up to use our service, therefore we do not collect any information regardinguser personal details.



Emails



We may send you email notifications regarding your service or which you have specifically requested.You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time. We will never provide youremail address to any third parties except where they are specifically employed to help deliver ourown services, as detailed above.



Security



MinuteInbox take many precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personalinformation. These precautions include:



 Use of SSL encryption for sensitive data



 Hardware stored in secured datacentres behind firewalls



 All access to information restricted by password and/or secure key



 Restrictions to what information can be accessed via any location

Whilst we take great care to ensure any confidential information remains protected we cannotguarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.

Of course you are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. Nobody atMinuteInbox will ever ask you for your password, so please don’t trust anybody asking you for it.



Data finding



MinuteInbox makes use of various 3rd party APIs to collect information about websites. For examplewe use the Google A API to gather local presence information (see Google Map’s privacy policy).



Updates to this policy



We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology changes. You canalways check this page for the latest version. We may also notify you of changes to our privacy policyby email.
