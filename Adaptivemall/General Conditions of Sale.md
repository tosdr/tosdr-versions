Return Policy
=============

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![Return Policy](https://www.adaptivemall.com/media/wysiwyg/Adaptive/Iconsandlogos_am/returns-policy-26.png) | As long as the equipment is returned in new, resaleable condition,<br><br>within 30 days of the receipt of the product with a Return Authorization <br><br>we will refund your original purchase cost without any re-stock fee! |

**_\*\*For the health and welfare of others, we regret that we cannot allow toileting or bathing/shower product returns because of sanitary and personal hygiene reasons. Some manufacturers will not permit returns on certain products. Please check with Customer Service if you have any questions._**

* * *

**Due to the custom, hand-made nature of Beds by George products, beds and accessories are NOT returnable. Please [contact us](https://www.adaptivemall.com/aboutus#contactus "Contact Us") with any questions so that we can help you find the best bed for your needs!**

* * *

  

**Check your order immediately upon delivery. Damaged or incomplete orders must be reported within 7 days of receipt.**

  

**There are certain things you must do in the event of a return.**

1. Keep your original carton and packing materials for safe transport! Please carefully repack the items in their original packaging so they are secure and tight inside the box. Utilize any plastic bags that came with your order - they protect items from vibration during shipping. 
2. **Contact us within **30 days** of the receipt of the products. Email us or call us for return instructions and a Return Authorization number.** _You must have a Return Authorization number to ensure that your return is processed._

**Some important notes about returns:**

* You will be responsible for the return shipping cost. To protect yourself, use a delivery service that has a tracking # and insurance. A refund will not be given on merchandise that is lost by the carrier.
* If you paid a shipping fee on your original order for expedited, international or other shipping it is Non-Refundable even upon return of your order.
* Please note that returns may go back to a different location than they originated from. If you return an item to our warehouse in New York without a Return Authorization Number the cost we incur to ship the item to the manufacturer's warehouse on your behalf will be deducted from the amount of your credit, if any.

**If the item cannot be made re-sellable you have the option of:**

1. Paying to have the item delivered back to you.
2. Adjustment to credit for a 25% Disposal Fee. 

* * *

**For Orders purchased in the USA using Bread Financing:**

1. Your first payment to Bread is due 30 days from the date your product is shipped.
2. If you decide to return a product any interest you may have paid to Bread may not be refundable if the product is received past Bread’s 30 day window.
