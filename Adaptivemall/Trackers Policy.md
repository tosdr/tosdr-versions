Security
--------

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

All Adaptivemall.com transactions are handled with industry-standard **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption**. When you enter your credit card number into a Adaptivemall.com order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it gets to us.

To check the security of your transfer connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. (You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https"). Some versions of browsers and some fire walls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you'll be unable to connect to the server so you won't have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. If you can't access the secure server for whatever reason, please place your order by phone, by US Mail or by fax.

If you are not the kind of person who worries about being hit by lightning as you're crossing the street, you probably don't have to worry that your credit card number will be intercepted on the way to a secure Web site. According to CNN, "The prevalent opinion...is that on-line credit card use is actually no riskier for consumers than traditional "low-tech" transactions." We order products online all the time, both as a company and as individuals. When we use a credit card to buy something online, we feel at least as safe as we would using one in a store or restaurant.

Did you know that under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges? Should an unauthorized use of your credit card take place anywhere, anytime, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
