* [![Jonathan Kennedy's "Infected" Art refers to a longstanding Twitter (now called X) thread featuring crude Come and Learn with Pibby crossover fanart drawn by user @Jonatha76257883, A.K.A. Jonathan Kennedy. The art typically features characters from different cartoons, television shows, and movies being taken over by a glitchy corrupting shadow, with some characters getting "infected" while others remain "survivors." The artwork is inspired by the 2021 promotional materials for Adult Swim's Come and Learn with Pibby. The Twitter user has been adding different characters to a thread of artwork since December 2021, with other users marveling at the years-long dedication to the project, the lack of artistic improvement, and the breadth of fandoms represented, with some users calling Jonathan Kennedy's "Infected" Art the One Piece of Twitter.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/featured_items/icons/wide/000/026/022/jonathan.jpg "This Twitter 'Artist' Has Been Drawing 'Pibby' Glitch Fanart For Three Years Now, Leaving People In Awe")
