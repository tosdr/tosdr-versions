3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. **Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.**

If you believe that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled was not infringing, you may submit a counter-notification. You may do so by sending us a written communication that includes substantially the following:

1\. Identification of the specific URLs of material that has been removed or to which we have disabled access.

2\. Your full name, address, telephone number, and email address.

If we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we will typically reinstate the material.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

Please be advised that we may terminate the accounts of repeat copyright infringers.
