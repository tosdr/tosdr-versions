3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. **Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.**
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

Please also note that under Section 512(f) any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.

**Counter-Notification**

If you believe that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled was not infringing, you may submit a counter-notification. You may do so by sending us a written communication that includes substantially the following:

1\. Identification of the specific URLs of material that has been removed or to which we have disabled access.

2\. Your full name, address, telephone number, and email address.

3\. The statement: “I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which Cheezburger, Inc. is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant.” (Cheezburger, Inc. is located in the Western District of Washington)

4\. The statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”

5\. A physical signature or electronic signature.

The counter-notice may be sent by regular mail to:

Literally Media Ltd  
146 N Canal Street  
Seattle, WA 98103

You may also send it to us via email at [info@literally.media](mailto:info@literally.media)

The information provided in your counter-notification will be forwarded to the person who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. After we forward your counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 business days that the claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our website. If we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we will typically reinstate the material.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

Please be advised that we may terminate the accounts of repeat copyright infringers.
