3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. **Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.**

Please be advised that we may terminate the accounts of repeat copyright infringers.
