* [![Halloweenposting also known as Spookyposting refers to a series of crudely made Halloween-themed re-edits of notable memes and GIFs. Such images are turned into exploitable versions of the original meme, now with Halloween symbols like jack-o-lanterns, spiders, cobwebs, witches, and orange and black elements added in. The base memes are also recaptioned with Halloween buzzwords and phrases. The trend started in October 2024, due to a viral Twitter / X thread. The -posting trend was similar to Alienposting and Pirateposting which similarly added low-brow visual symbols to crudely alter the theme of a pre-existing meme.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/featured_items/icons/wide/000/026/181/spookypost.jpg "Halloweenposting Is The Jollyposting Redux That Has Everyone Making Custom Spooky GIFs")
