8\. Fees and Charges
--------------------

8.1 Paddle will report to you in the Payment Currency, however you will be able to access data on individual resales of Products in the currency used by the Buyer.

8.2 The number and value of confirmed sales will be provided to the Supplier via the Supplier Dashboard. Provided the Supplier Fee accrued during each month is above $100, €100 or £100 (or some higher amount as agreed between you and Paddle) Paddle shall pay the Supplier Fee to you on or before the 15th of the following month provided that you have provided Paddle with all relevant information required to process a payment to you. Paddle reserves the right to delegate the responsibility to make payment under this Agreement to an Affiliate Entity.

8.3 If you are VAT registered in the European Union, you agree to inform Paddle if you stop being registered for VAT, get a new VAT registration number or transfer your business as a going concern.

8.4 Where possible, Paddle will make international transfers through our local ACH network and there will be no charge to you for such transfers.

If you opt to receive payment in a currency different to the Payment Currency, then we reserve the right to charge a conversion margin of up to 1.5%. We will go to all reasonable efforts to ensure no additional fees are charged, but are not responsible for any charges that do occur.

8.5 If Paddle is required to refund a Buyer (including through Chargebacks), Paddle is entitled to receive from you the amount of the refund or Chargeback as well as any charges and fees incurred by Paddle as a result, up to 20 GBP, USD or EUR depending on the Transaction Currency (if the Transaction Currency is any other currency, this will be based on the Payment Currency). Paddle reserves the right to suspend all Services until the deficit is paid by you.

8.6 Where any credit is due to an Invoiced Business or Invoiced Consumer due to service level or similar failures in the provision of the Product by you, no credit will be given to you for any previously applied Paddle Discount and the Paddle Discount will be applied to the gross amount of any amounts invoiced prior to deduction of any service level or similar credit.

9\. Set Off
-----------

9.1 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies we may have, the Supplier hereby authorises us to set-off by whatever means the whole or any part of the Supplier's liability to us under this Agreement against any funds, sums or other amounts owing to, the Supplier under this Agreement including but not limited to:

(i) liability for refunds and Chargebacks;

(ii) any fines issued for non compliance with the Payment Scheme Rules;

(iii) breach of our Acceptable Use Policy; 

(iv) fraudulent or illegal use of our Services; or

(v) other liabilities as set out in this Agreement.

9.2 You agree that we may exercise the right of set-off in clause 9.1 at any time, without further notice to you whether your liability is present or future, liquidated or unliquidated, actual or contingent. If the liability to be set off is expressed in different currencies, we may convert such liability at a market rate of exchange for the purpose of set-off. In the event such set-off does not fully reimburse us for the liability owed, you shall immediately pay us a sum equal to any shortfall.

9.3 If there are insufficient funds, in Paddle’s sole discretion at any time to cover potential refunds, chargebacks, charges against the Supplier Account or other liabilities you may owe to us ("**Liabilities**"), you agree to either put Paddle in sufficient funds or agree that we may exercise the right of set-off in clause 9.1 at any time without notice to the Supplier whether such liability is present or future, liquidated or unliquidated, actual or contingent. If the liability to be set off is expressed in different currencies, we may convert such liability at a market rate of exchange for the purpose of set-off. In the event such set-off does not fully reimburse us for the liability owed, the Supplier shall immediately pay us a sum equal to any shortfall.

9.4 For the avoidance of doubt, Paddle is not obliged to pay any Supplier Fees associated with activities or Products which it considers in its sole discretion to be fraudulent or illegal under any relevant law or regulation. We may suspend your Supplier Account and retain any Supplier Fees, or terminate this Agreement, if

(i) we determine in our sole discretion that you are ineligible for the Services because of significant fraud risk, or any other risk of illegal activity associated with your Supplier Account; 

(ii) any Law or Payment Scheme Rules requires us to do so; or 

(iii) we are otherwise entitled to do so under this Agreement.
