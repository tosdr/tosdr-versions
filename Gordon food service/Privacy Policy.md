##### Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies

As is commonly done on websites, we may use automated data collections mechanisms (“Cookies”) such as cookies, pixels, and web beacons to keep track of our customers and the Services they have elected. Our collection of data through the use of Cookies helps us to improve and market our Services and provide you with an enhanced user experience. We have partnered with select third parties that also place these tools on our Website to collect and process information about our users for various purposes, including for security, for analytics, and to facilitate targeted advertising.

You may also be able to adjust your Cookie settings via your browser or your device. Please note that limiting GFS’s ability to set Cookies may degrade your overall user experience, because the Services may no longer be personalized to you, you may not be able to save customized settings like login information, and the Website and Services may not function as intended.

##### Transfers of Your Personal Information Outside of Your Jurisdiction

We are headquartered in the United States. Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of our Platforms may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to, maintained and processed in the United States by us or our service providers for the purposes mentioned above in accordance with applicable law. The privacy laws of the United States may not always offer the same level of protection as in your country. While such information is outside of your jurisdiction of residence, it is subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other jurisdictions, pursuant to local laws. By using our Platforms, you consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information. If you would like more information about such transfer, maintenance, or processing of your data, please contact our Privacy Officer at [privacy@gfs.com](mailto:privacy@gfs.com).

##### Withdrawing Your Consent to Our Processing

Except for personal information which is required to be retained by law or which is needed to process a purchase, exchange or return, individuals may withdraw consent to all or part of the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information at any time by giving us reasonable notice. If you would prefer that we not collect, use, or disclose your personal information, or that we not use your personal information to contact you to promote our products or services, please contact us. We will act on your instructions as quickly as possible subject to contractual and legal restrictions, but there may be certain uses of your information that we may not be able to stop immediately. Please be advised that withdrawal of consent may make it impossible for us to provide certain services to you.

##### How We Protect Your Data

At GFS we take the protection of your personal information seriously. We make every reasonable effort to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, loss or theft of your personal information. Employees who have access to your personal information are made aware of the importance of keeping it confidential. 

Where we use service providers who might have access to your personal information, we select them carefully and require them to have privacy and security standards that are comparable to ours. We use contracts and other measures with our service providers to ensure that they maintain the confidentiality and security of your personal information and to prevent such information from being used for any other purpose.

Please be aware that no data security measures can guarantee complete security. You should also take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping your log-in and password private. If you do not want GFS to know any particular information about you, you should not include that information in anything you submit or post to the Platforms.

##### Retention of Your Data

We will only retain your personal information as long as is necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Your personal information is securely stored until such time as it is no longer required, after which it is destroyed or rendered such that it is unable to identify you.

We are committed to making the Website’s content accessible and user friendly to everyone. If you are having difficulty viewing or navigating the content on this website, or notice any content, feature, or functionality that you believe is not fully accessible to people with disabilities, please call us at (800) 968–4164 or email us at privacy@gfs.com with “Assist with Access” in the subject line and provide a description of the specific feature you feel is not fully accessible or a suggestion for improvement.
