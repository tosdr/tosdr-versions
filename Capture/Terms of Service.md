Terms Of Service
================

YesVideo, Inc. (“**_YesVideo_**”, “**_We_**”, or “**_us_**”) welcomes you to our websites ([www.yesvideo.com](http://www.yesvideo.com/) and/or [www.capture.com](http://www.capture.com/), each a “**_Site_**”) and the applications and services available from us, including the YesVideo digital conversion, online hosting, and sharing services (collectively with the Sites, the “**_Services_**”). Your use of the Sites and Services are governed by these Terms of Service (these “**_Terms_**”). Any time you browse the Site or use the Services in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site or the Services.

Your use of the Services is also subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.capture.com/pages/privacy-policy), which is located on the Site, as well as any policies and procedures we publish from time to time (collectively, the “**_Policies_**”). We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, with such changes becoming effective when we post the modified Terms to the Site. We also reserve the right to make any changes to the Site and Services in any manner and to deny or terminate your access to the Site and Services, even if you have an Account, in our sole discretion.

If you have questions about these Terms or our Policies, please contact us via email at [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com).

**_These Terms contain important information regarding your rights with respect to the Site and the Services, including your relationship with us, and include an arbitration provision that may limit your ability to pursue claims against us in court. Please read them carefully and review them regularly._**

1. **Services**

YesVideo offers digital conversion of photos, videos, film, and digital media to help you preserve your favorite moments and memories. When you place an order (an “**_Order_**”), you will be provided and required to pay an estimated amount for the Services requested (the “**_Estimated Fees_**”). Once your order is complete, you will receive an email notice from us that we have finished processing your Order and detailing any adjustments necessary to account for discrepancies between the Estimated Fees and the final cost Services (the “**_Total Fees_**”). Following payment of the Total Fees, as applicable, you will receive an email notice from us that your order has shipped, along with instructions on how to access and save the transferred digital files from your order ("**_Digital Files_**"). All Digital Files are accessible for sixty (60) days following delivery of this email notice (“**_Availability Period_**”). This email notice will tell you how many days your files are available for. **DIGITAL FILES ARE DELETED FROM THE YESVIDEO SYSTEMS UPON EXPIRATION OF THE AVAILABILITY PERIOD.**

You may choose to download and/or add Digital Files to Google Photos during the Availability Period. As a YesVideo customer using the Home Movie and Photo Transfer Service, all Digital Files added to Google Photos are stored at 'original quality', count towards your Google Photos storage quota, and are subject to Google’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Adding Digital Files to Google Photos requires internet access and a Google account. Google accounts may be created online for free.

2. **Fees**

As noted above, prior to placing an Order for the Services you must pay the Estimated Fees. When you place an Order, you acknowledge and agree that payment of the Total Fees is required prior to you receiving your Digital Files. In the event the Total Fees are less than the Estimated Fees paid, you will be entitled to, and YesVideo shall provide, a refund for the difference.

3. **Eligibility**

When you use the Services, you represent that you are (i) at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you reside or (ii) if you have not reached the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you reside, that you have received permission to use the Services from your parent or legal guardian. In no event shall the Services be used by any person under the age of 13.

You represent and warrant that any information you submit to us when using the Services is accurate, truthful, and current. You also represent that your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation.

4. **Accounts, Passwords & Security**

Certain of the Services or portions of the Site may require you to register for an account (“**_Account_**”), becoming a “**_Registered User_**”. As part of the Account creation process, you may be asked to provide a username and password unique to the Account (“**_Login Information_**”).  You are responsible for the confidentiality and use of your Login Information and agree not to transfer or disclose your Login Information to any third party other than an individual with express authority to act on your behalf. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account, you agree to notify us immediately.  You are solely responsible for any activities occurring under your Account. You have no ownership right to your Account.

5. **Permitted Uses/License**

You are authorized to access the Site for the sole purpose of viewing and using the Services on your computer or device. We authorize you to copy materials from the Services to your device’s local or cloud storage solely for the purpose of viewing and using the Services. You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You agree to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations (for example, federal, state, and local) applicable to your use of the Service and your User Content (defined below), including but not limited to, copyright laws.

You may not decompile, disassemble, rent, lease, loan, sell, sublicense, or create derivative works from the Site, the Services, or any data thereon. You may not use any robot, spider, or other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy the Site or its content without our prior written permission. Your failure to abide by these conditions will immediately terminate your right to access the Site or to use the Services and may violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of third parties.

6. **Intellectual Property**

You acknowledge and agree that YesVideo and our licensors retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Site, including, but not limited to, applicable copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights (“**_Intellectual Property_**”). YesVideo’s Intellectual Property may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under these Terms.

7. **User Content**

YesVideo does not claim any ownership rights in content which is content generated solely by you, or uploaded to the Services by you on your behalf by YesVideo or our affiliates (hereafter, “**_User Content_**”). However, by submitting User Content to the Services, you grant us a license to fully enable us (and affiliates) to use any information or User Content you supply us to provide the Services to you, so that we are not violating any rights you might have in that User Content. By utilizing the Services, you consent to allow YesVideo access your computer’s files, as applicable, to access any User Content that you choose to upload to the Services.

YesVideo allows you to share some or all of your User Content. If you decide to share your User Content, you acknowledge that we have no control over such other users' access and therefore YesVideo hereby disclaims any such associated liability.

In fact, you acknowledge that YesVideo does not have any obligation to monitor any of the User Content that is uploaded, posted, submitted, linked to or otherwise transmitted using the Service, for any purpose and, as a result, is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, timeliness, legality or applicability of the User Content or anything said, depicted, or written by users in their submissions, including, without limitation, any information obtained by using the Service. YesVideo does not endorse anything contained in any User Content, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against YesVideo with respect thereto.

**YesVideo does not warrant that the Site or the Services will operate error-free or that the Site is free of computer viruses and/or other harmful materials. You acknowledge that use of the Services may result in unexpected results, loss or corruption of data and that if your use of the Site or the Services results in the need for servicing or replacing your equipment or data, we are not responsible for any such costs.** Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitation of certain categories of damages or implied warranties; therefore, the above limitations may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

14. **Limitation of Liability**

**Any liability we have to you in connection with these Terms, under any cause of action or theory, is strictly limited to, in aggregate for all violations, $100. Without limiting the previous sentence, in no event shall we or any of our affiliates be liable to you for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of, or in connection with, these Terms. The foregoing limitations shall apply whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we or our affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages.**

**You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any breach of security or any compromise of your Account.** Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential; therefore, the above limitations may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

15. **Indemnification**

17. **Dispute Resolution**

READ THIS SECTION 18 CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CANSEEK RELIEF FROM US. For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “**_Claims_**”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using the Site for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Site for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights.

18. **Entire Agreement; Governing Law**

You agree that, to the extent applicable and expressly subject to the dispute resolution provisions below, to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts serving Santa Clara County, California in circumstances where these Terms permit litigation in court. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit YesVideo from instituting an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights.

19. **Electronic Signatures & Notices**

You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to a third party without the prior written consent of YesVideo. If we fail to enforce a provision of these Terms, you agree that such a failure does not constitute a waiver to enforce the provision (or any other provision hereunder). If any provision of these Terms is held or made invalid, the invalidity does not affect the remainder of these Terms. YesVideo is not liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, failure of the internet, power failure, failure of computer, telecommunication or other equipment, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortage of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts, or non-performance of third parties.
