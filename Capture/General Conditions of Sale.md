Shipping Policy
===============

### **OUR MEMORY FACTORY**

Your orders ship to and from our Memory Factory in Norcross, Georgia. 

### **PROCESSING TIME**

Please allow 2-3 weeks for us to process and fulfill your order.

The privacy and security of your precious memories is our highest priority. We will keep you informed throughout the entire process for your peace of mind. You will receive an email notification once your media arrives at our facilities, and another email when we ship it back to you.

### **WE OFFER 2 OPTIONS FOR SHIPPING YOUR ORDER:** 

**1\. Roundtrip shipping: $23.99  
**

We are proud to partner with UPS to provide you a simple shipping option. During the order checkout process, you can opt to purchase Roundtrip Shipping for $23.98. This includes a prepaid UPS shipping label to be used to send your packaged media in to us for processing at our facility in Norcross, GA as well as the return shipping of your completed order. When dropping off your order at your local UPS Store, you can retain your tracking number to track the progress of your inbound shipment on the UPS website: [www.ups.com/track](https://www.ups.com/track). Once your order is complete, we will send you your original media plus any outputs that you ordered back to you via UPS Ground. Upon shipping your package back to you, we will send an email to notify you that the shipment is on its way along with the UPS tracking number so that you can track the process of your shipment. 

**2\. Return shipping: $11.99  
  
**With this option, you will send your packaged media to us via your preferred method instead of using a prepaid UPS label. During the order checkout process, you can opt to purchase only return shipping for $11.99. Once your order is complete, we will send your original media plus any outputs that you ordered back to you via UPS Ground. Upon shipping your package back to you, we will send an email to notify you that the shipment is on its way along with the UPS tracking number so that you can track the process of your shipment. 

 

_We deliver to addresses in the 48 contiguous US states. We do not ship to Puerto Rico, Canada, South America or the US Virgin Islands. We do not ship to Armed Forces or PO boxes. We apologize for any inconvenience._

**QUESTIONS?**

Users with questions about shipping may contact Capture via email at support@capture.com.
