### Communications Preferences

You may opt out of receiving certain marketing communications from us by updating your account settings, sending us a request with your contact information to [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com), or by following the instructions in the communications – generally, clicking an unsubscribe link at the bottom of a marketing email. You cannot generally opt out of transactional or administrative emails, so we may continue to send you those emails even if you opt out from marketing emails.

6\. California Privacy Rights
-----------------------------

The California Consumer Privacy Act or “**_CCPA_**” (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq.) affords consumers residing in California certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a California resident, this section applies to you.

In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity information, and inferences. For details about the precise data points we collect and the categories of sources of such collection, please see the [Information We Collect](#_Information_We_Collect) section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the [How Information Is Used](#_How_Information_Is) section above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business purposes to the following categories of recipients:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category of Personal Information** | **Categories of Recipients** |
| **Identifiers** | Analytics Providers<br><br>Communication Providers<br><br>Customer Service Providers<br><br>Fraud Prevention and Security Providers<br><br>Infrastructure Providers<br><br>Marketing Providers<br><br>Payment Processors |
| **Commercial Information** | Analytics Providers<br><br>Infrastructure Providers<br><br>Payment Processors |
| **Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information** | Analytics Providers<br><br>Infrastructure Providers |
| **Inferences** | Analytics Providers<br><br>Infrastructure Providers |

We do not sell your personal information.

Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose about you, (2) request deletion of your personal information, (3) opt out of any sales of your personal information, if we engage in that activity in the future, and (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. You may make these requests by emailing us at: [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com). We will verify a webform request by asking you to provide identifying information. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. This may include requiring you to verify your identity. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please email us at: [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com).

Under the CCPA’s broad definition of “**_sell_**,” this could be considered a sale. If you wish to opt out of this activity, you may do so.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 18. Data will not be shared with any third parties for their marketing purposes.

### Children Under 13

Consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Act of 1998 (“**_COPPA_**”), YesVideo does not intentionally gather personal information about visitors who are under the age of 13. Any person who provides their personal information to YesVideo through the Services represents and warrants that they are 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13, do not use the Services or provide any personal information on this site or through any of its features. If YesVideo learns we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

7. Links to Third Party Sites
-----------------------------

YesVideo sites may contain links to other websites that are not under our control. These websites may or may not have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our users.

8. Security
-----------

YesVideo uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Services in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, such as using SSL security measures, we cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” or “crackers” from obtaining this information.
