3\. Sharing and Disclosing of Information
-----------------------------------------

We share personal information in the following circumstances or as otherwise detailed in this Policy:

* We share personal information with vendors, service providers, and consultants that need to access the information to perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with webhosting, storage, and other infrastructure, analytics, payment processing, fraud prevention and security, customer service, communications, and marketing. Such third-party business partners or affiliates may have their own privacy policies, and if YesVideo discloses the third-parties name to the user, it is your responsibility to read and adhere to such policies.

To facilitate this partnership, we may collect, store, and use certain Google User Data, including your Google User ID and Google email address. We collect this information directly from you during account activation or when you place an order with us, and use this information to add requested content to your Google Photo account and to turn on sharing of specific albums when requested by you. We do not have the ability to list, view, or remove existing Google Photo content. We will only use Google User Data for the purposes described in this paragraph.
* We share personal information with our attorneys and other professional advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests.
* We may disclose personal information if we believe such disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process.

* We may share personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, a merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or part of our business by another company.
* We share personal information between and among us and our current and future parents, affiliates, and companies under common ownership.
* We share personal information with your consent or at your direction.
* We share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

### Surveillance

YesVideo disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by users or others. We will not view the files that you upload using the Service, unless reasonably required for monitoring purposes (see our [Terms of Service](https://www.capture.com/pages/terms-of-service)). However, YesVideo will review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm YesVideo, its users or other third parties.

4. Transfers of Information
---------------------------

YesVideo is headquartered in the United States and have operations and service providers in the United States and other countries. Accordingly, YesVideo and our affiliates, subsidiaries and service providers may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. By using or accessing the Services, you consent to any such transfer of your personal information outside of your country. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

5\. Your Choices; Updating or Removing Your Information
-------------------------------------------------------

### Account Information

You may, at any time, choose to correct, update or remove the information you have submitted to YesVideo by updating your account on our site.

You may request deletion of any personal information that you have provided to us by sending the request to [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com). We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. However, even if you terminate your account, bear in mind that your personal information may be retained in our archive or backup records.

### Cookies

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can generally adjust your browser settings to remove or reject browser cookies; however, please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of the Services.

### Communications Preferences

You may opt out of receiving certain marketing communications from us by updating your account settings, sending us a request with your contact information to [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com), or by following the instructions in the communications – generally, clicking an unsubscribe link at the bottom of a marketing email. You cannot generally opt out of transactional or administrative emails, so we may continue to send you those emails even if you opt out from marketing emails.

6\. California Privacy Rights
-----------------------------

The California Consumer Privacy Act or “**_CCPA_**” (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq.) affords consumers residing in California certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a California resident, this section applies to you.

In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity information, and inferences. For details about the precise data points we collect and the categories of sources of such collection, please see the [Information We Collect](#_Information_We_Collect) section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the [How Information Is Used](#_How_Information_Is) section above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business purposes to the following categories of recipients:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category of Personal Information** | **Categories of Recipients** |
| **Identifiers** | Analytics Providers<br><br>Communication Providers<br><br>Customer Service Providers<br><br>Fraud Prevention and Security Providers<br><br>Infrastructure Providers<br><br>Marketing Providers<br><br>Payment Processors |

| **Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information** | Analytics Providers<br><br>Infrastructure Providers |
| **Inferences** | Analytics Providers<br><br>Infrastructure Providers |

We do not sell your personal information.

Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose about you, (2) request deletion of your personal information, (3) opt out of any sales of your personal information, if we engage in that activity in the future, and (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. You may make these requests by emailing us at: [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com). We will verify a webform request by asking you to provide identifying information. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. This may include requiring you to verify your identity. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please email us at: [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com).

Under the CCPA’s broad definition of “**_sell_**,” this could be considered a sale. If you wish to opt out of this activity, you may do so.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of 18. Data will not be shared with any third parties for their marketing purposes.

### Children Under 13

Consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Act of 1998 (“**_COPPA_**”), YesVideo does not intentionally gather personal information about visitors who are under the age of 13. Any person who provides their personal information to YesVideo through the Services represents and warrants that they are 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13, do not use the Services or provide any personal information on this site or through any of its features. If YesVideo learns we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

7. Links to Third Party Sites
-----------------------------

YesVideo sites may contain links to other websites that are not under our control. These websites may or may not have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our users.

8. Security
-----------

YesVideo uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Services in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, such as using SSL security measures, we cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” or “crackers” from obtaining this information.
