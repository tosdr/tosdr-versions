We may collect this information when you log in to your account. |
| User data: It is data that you store on TeraBox, such as files, documents, photos, videos, and audio ("user data"). | We may store, process, and transfer user data and relevant information to ensure proper operations for the Services and enable you to collaborate with others and work across devices and Services.

Sharing data with other users

When you use the Teamwork or Share functions of TeraBox, the Services display your nickname, device information, email address, and usage information to users that you cooperate with, or information that you permit to share. This allows you to be updated on information about the team that you will join and enable other users to share files and folders with you.

We may share your information with third parties

We may work with certain trusted third parties (such as customer support or IT service providers) that can help us better deliver, optimize, protect, and promote the Services. These third parties may have access to your information to perform tasks on our behalf, during which we remain responsible for the third parties' handling of your information in accordance with our requirements.

  

We may share infrastructure, systems, and technology with Flextech affiliates to deliver, optimize, protect, and promote the Services. These affiliates will use your information in conjunction with us and the information you have listed in the "What information is collected and for what purpose" section for the purposes described therein. We will be responsible for granting these companies access to your information.

  

You may choose to connect to your TeraBox account through a third-party service. By connecting to a service of this kind, you allow the third parties and us to exchange the information listed in the "What information is collected and for what purpose" section of this Privacy Policy so that the third parties and we can deliver, optimize, protect, and promote their services. In these cases, the use of your information will be governed by the privacy policies and terms of service of the third parties whose services you choose to connect through.

  

We will establish an output mechanism for cross-border data transfer with reference to the requirements of the GDPR and update it as required. Our processing of personal data will depend on the fundamental principles of the GDPR, the consent of valid data subjects, or other legitimate reasons. Apart from that, additional mechanisms will be put in place to protect data and meet the substantive requirements of the GDPR for data processing.

How we protect and store your information

We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. In addition to two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps link to your accounts, we continue to work hard to ensure the security of your information. We deploy automated technology to detect abusive behavior and content that could harm you, other users, or the Services.

After you have signed up for a TeraBox account, we retain the information you store in the Services for as long as your account exists or as long as necessary to provide you with the Services. If you want to delete your account, please send an email to [helpdesk@terabox.com](mailto:helpdesk@terabox.com) with such a request and we will delete your account within 30 days after receiving your request. However, 1) we will not delete your account information until we have verified your user identity; 2) such deletion of information from our servers and backup storage may be delayed; 3) we may retain this information if necessary to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or exercise our rights under the Contract.

We will store your personal information for the period required for providing the Services. However, in the event that laws and regulations require otherwise, you agree to keep the information for a longer term, it is necessary to ensure the security and quality of the Services, the information is required to settle disputes, or it is technically intractable to process the information as required, we will extend the retention period as per laws and agreement or to a reasonable extent after the expiration of the aforesaid period.

When the retention period expires, we will delete your personal information or de-identify it in accordance with laws and regulations.

We will collect, use, store, and transfer your information based on the principle of "minimization", and inform you of the purpose and scope of use of the information by means of user agreement, privacy policy, rules, pop-up notifications, notices, and so on.

We attach great importance to information security. We have a dedicated team to develop and employ a variety of security technologies and programs. We carry out security background checks on personnel in charge of security management and those in critical security positions. We have established a complete information security management system and internal mechanisms for handling security events and more. We take appropriate security measures and technical means in line with industry standards to store and protect your personal information, so as to prevent your information from being lost or accessed, disclosed, used, damaged, or revealed without authorization. All reasonable and feasible measures are being taken for protecting your personal information. In addition, we use encryption technology to ensure the confidentiality of data and apply trusted protection mechanisms to prevent malicious attacks on data.

We train and assess our employees in terms of data security awareness and security abilities to enhance their comprehension of the importance of protecting personal information. We authenticate the identity of employees who process personal information and control their access, sign nondisclosure agreements with our employees and partners who have access to your personal information, and clarify job responsibilities and code of conduct, so that only authorized personnel can access personal information. In the event of any violation of the nondisclosure agreements, the employment will be terminated immediately with the violator held accountable by law. Moreover, there are also confidentiality requirements that relevant personnel must follow when they leave their posts.

We kindly remind you that the Internet is not absolutely secure. Hence, you should carefully protect your personal information when you interact with other users through third-party social software, emails, SMS, and other services integrated into TeraBox under the condition that you are uncertain whether your information is completely encrypted during transfer.

Also, we appreciate your understanding that due to the technical restrictions, rapid development, and various latent and malicious attacks pertaining to the Internet industry, we may not be able to keep your information secure a hundred percent even though we make every effort to enhance our security measures. Hence, the system and communication network based on which you use our product and/or the Services may encounter security problems in other processes beyond our control.

Our security management system regards the disclosure, damage, or loss of personal information as the most serious security event. Once it occurs, our highest-level emergency plan will be implemented with multiple departments dealing with the event as one emergency response team.

We formulate an emergency plan for network security events to promptly respond to system vulnerabilities, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, network intrusions, and other security risks. In case of an event endangering network security, we will immediately carry out the plan, take remedial actions, and report to competent authorities as required.

The disclosure, damage, and loss of personal information are regarded as the most serious security events. Accordingly, we organize members of working groups to perform security plan drills on a regular basis to avoid such events. In the event that such events do occur, we will carry out the emergency plan as a top priority and form an emergency response team to trace the cause and mitigate losses in the shortest time possible.

In case of a personal information security event, we will, as required by laws and regulations, inform you of the basic information about the security event and its possible impact, the measures we have taken or will take, recommendations on actively preventing and mitigating risks for you, and remedial measures for you. We will inform you of event-related information in a timely manner through our notifications or the contact information you have provided to us including SMS, phone number, and email address. If it is difficult to inform our users one by one, we will make announcements in a reasonable and effective way. Meanwhile, we will report the disposal of the personal information security event in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities. We appreciate your understanding that according to laws and regulations, if measures taken by us can effectively avoid the harm caused by disclosure, tampering, and loss of information, we may choose not to notify you of a personal information security event unless a regulatory authority requires us to do so.

We refer to the requirements of the GDPR, select appropriate measures for technical security protection based on the nature, scope, background, and purpose of data processing, as well as the risks to individuals, and regularly test and evaluate the measures to maintain their effectiveness.

If data is accidentally disclosed, we will notify affected people as soon as possible and report to competent authorities within 72 hours. If it is impossible to report it within 72 hours, the reason for the delay will be clarified.

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to achieve our data protection objectives, such as the principle of data minimization and the integration of necessary safeguards into data processing to protect the rights of data subjects and make sure any data processed is necessary for a specific purpose by default.

Where we store and process your information

4\. The right of withdrawal of consent

The implementation of each service or function requires some basic personal information. For any additional collection and use of your personal information, you may give or withdraw your consent at any time.

You can directly disable access to the contacts, photos, camera, and so on in the system of your device, change the scope of consent, or withdraw your authorization.

\[Account Avatar\] - \[Menu\] - \[Settings\] - \[Security Center\] - \[Account Deletion\].

Once you have deleted your account, you will not be able to use the Services of TearBox, so please think it through before deletion.

For example, if you have unused Premium benefits or any data in your account, we will not accept your request immediately. Unless otherwise required by laws and regulations, we will stop providing you with the product and the Services, and delete your personal information according to your requirements after your account has been deleted.

6\. The right of copy and data portability

You have the right to copy your personal information collected by us.

(a) charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs of information provision, communication, or corresponding actions; or

(b) refuse to act on the request.

お客様がTeraBoxアカウントを登録した後、当社はお客様が本サービスに保存した情報を、お客様のアカウントが存在する限り、またはお客様に本サービスを提供するために必要な限り、保持します。お客様がアカウントの削除を希望される場合、その旨を記載したメールを [helpdesk@terabox.com](mailto:helpdesk@terabox.com) 宛てに送信するか、「お客様の情報の管理およびアクセス方法」に記載の方法でアカウントの削除を申請してください。お客様のリクエストを受信後、30日以内にアカウントを削除します。

個人情報の漏えい、破壊、紛失は、セキュリティ上最も重大な事象と位置づけています。そのため、定期的にセキュリティ対策訓練を実施し、その回避に努めています。万が一、このような事態が発生した場合には、緊急対策を最優先に実施し、緊急対策本部を設置して原因究明と被害拡大の防止措置を最優先で行います。個人情報のセキュリティ事象が発生した場合、セキュリティ事象の基本情報及び想定される影響、当社が講じた又は講じる予定の対策、お客様に対するリスクの積極的な予防及び軽減のための外に関する情報や改善策を、サービス上での通知またはSMS、電話番号、電子メールアドレスなどお客様が当社に提供した連絡先を通じて、適時にお知らせします。

また、お客様に個別にお知らせすることが困難な場合は、当社のウェブサイト上での掲示など合理的かつ効果的な方法で告知を行います。

当社は、GDPRの要件を参照し、データ処理の性質、範囲、背景、目的、および個人に対するリスクに基づいて技術的なセキュリティ保護のための適切な措置を選択し、その有効性を維持するために定期的に措置をテストし評価します。 データが誤って開示された場合、影響を受ける人々にできるだけ早く通知し、72時間以内に監督官庁に報告します。72時間以内に報告することが不可能な場合は、その理由を明らかにします。 当社は、データの最小化の原則や、データ主体の権利を保護するために必要な保護措置をデータ処理に組み込むなど、データ保護の目的を達成するために適切な技術的・組織的措置をとり、処理されるデータがデフォルトで特定の目的のために必要であることを確認します。

유저님께서 TeraBox가 제공하는 팀 협력 및 파일 공유 기능을 이용하시게 되면, 저희 서비스는 유저님의 닉네임, 기기, 이메일 주소 등 사용 정보들을 유저님이 함께 협력 중인 기타 유저들에게 표시하고 유저님의 권한 설정에 따라 유저님에게 공유해 드립니다. 이는 유저님과 유저님이 가입하시고자 하는 팀과 동기화를 진행하고 기타 유저들이 유저님과 파일과 폴더들을 공유하는 데 도움을 줍니다.

저희는 제3자에게 유저님의 개인 정보를 공유할 수 있습니다

저희는 저희의 서비스를 더 나은 방식으로 제공, 최적화, 보호, 홍보할 수 있도록 일부 신뢰성 있는 제3자 업체(고객 지원 및 IT 서비스 제공 업체 등)가 제공하는 서비스를 이용할 수 있습니다. 해당 제3자 업체들은 유저님의 정보에 접근할 수 있으며, 저희를 대리하여 업무를 진행할 수 있습니다. 단, 저희는 여전히 제3자 업체가 저희의 지시에 따라 유저님의 개인 정보를 처리하는 전체 과정에 대한 책임을 지게 됩니다.

  

또한, 저희는 저희의 서비스를 제공, 개선, 보호, 그리고 홍보하기 위해 Flextech 측의 계열사들과 기초 인프라, 시스템, 그리고 기술들을 공유할 수 있습니다. 해당 계열사들은 저희와 함께 유저님의 개인 정보들을 사용하게 되며, “수집 정보의 내용 및 목적” 상의 리스트에 명시되어 있는 유저님의 개인 정보들을 해당 정책 상에 기술되어 있는 목적에 따라 사용하게 됩니다. 저희는 해당 업체들이 유저님의 개인 정보를 사용하는 과정에 책임을 지게 됩니다.

  

유저님께서는 제3자 서비스를 통해 TeraBox 계정에 연결하는 방식을 선택하실 수 있습니다. 유저님께서는 이러한 서비스 연결을 진행함으로써 해당 제3자 서비스 제공자들과 저희가 해당 프라이버시 정책 내의 “수집 정보의 내용 및 목적” 파트에 나열되어 있는 정보들을 교환하는 것에 동의하시게 됩니다. 이는 해당 제3자 업체들과 저희가 그들이 제공하는 서비스를 제공, 개선, 보호, 및 촉진할 수 있도록 하기 위함입니다. 이러한 상황 하에서 유저님의 개인 정보에 대한 사용은 유저님이 서비스 연결을 위해 선택하신 제3자 서비스 제공자가 제정한 프라이버시 정책과 서비스 약관의 관할 하에 놓이게 됩니다.

  

저희는 GDPR 측의 요구 사항을 참고하여 국경 간 데이터 전송의 반출 체계를 수립할 것이며, GDPR의 요구 사항에 따라 필요할 시 적정한 시점에 해당 반출 체계를 갱신할 것입니다. 개인 데이터에 대해 진행하는 모든 처리 절차는 GDPR의 기본적인 원칙과 규정을 만족하는 선에서 이루어지며, 유효한 데이터 주체의 동의를 얻거나 기타 합법적인 사유를 만족하는 선에서 진행됩니다. 이를 제외하고, 저희는 데이터 보호를 위해 별도의 체계를 마련하여 데이터 처리에 대한 GDPR 측의 실질적인 요구 사항들을 만족시킬 것입니다.

개인정보 저장 및 보호 방안

저희는 유저님의 정보를 보호하고 보안 테스팅을 진행하는 데 주력하는 1개의 업무팀을 운영하고 있습니다. 저희는 2중 신분 인증, 파일 암호화 금지, 신규 기기 및 앱을 통한 계정 접근 시 알림 발송 등 조치들 외에도 지속적인 노력을 통해 유저님의 개인 정보를 안전하게 보호할 것입니다. 저희는 저희의 서비스를 손상 시킬 수 있는 행위 및 컨텐츠, 그리고 유저님이나 기타 유저들의 잠재적인 남용 행위를 포착하기 위해 자동화 기술을 도입했습니다.

유저님이 TeraBox 계정을 신규 개설하시게 되면 저희는 유저님의 계정이 존재하는 동안, 혹은 저희가 유저님에게 서비스를 제공해 드려야 하는 이상 유저님이 저희 서버 상에 저장하신 정보들을 지속적으로 보관할 것입니다. 계정 삭제를 원하실 경우에는 [helpdesk@terabox.com](mailto:helpdesk@terabox.com)로 이메일을 발송하여 유저님의 정보를 삭제해 주십시오. 저희는 유저님의 요청 사항을 수신한 후 30일 내에 해당 업무를 완료할 것입니다. 단, (1) 유저님의 신분이 검증되기 전까지는 유저님의 계정 정보를 삭제하지 않을 것입니다. (2) 저희의 서버나 백업 스토리지 상에서 데이터를 삭제하는 데는 시간이 추가적으로 소요될 수 있습니다. (3) 저희는 법적 의무를 준수하고 분쟁을 해결하거나 약관 상의 권리를 이행하기 위해 필요할 시 해당 정보들을 그대로 보관할 수 있습니다.

저희는 서비스를 제공하기 위해 필요한 기간 내에 유저님의 개인 정보를 보관할 예정입니다. 단, 데이터 보존 기간에 대한 별도의 법적 근거가 존재하고 유저님이 데이터 보관 기한 연장에 동의하시며, 서비스의 안정성과 품질을 보장하고 분쟁 해결의 목적을 달성하거나 해당 조치가 기술적으로 어려울 경우에는 앞서 기술된 데이터 보관 기간이 만료되어도 법적 근거와 약관, 혹은 합리적인 범위 내에서 보관 기간을 연장할 수 있습니다.

보관 기한을 초과하게 될 경우, 저희는 법률 상의 규정에 따라 유저님의 개인 정보를 삭제하거나 익명화 작업을 진행하여

‘최소화’의 원칙을 준수하며 유저님의 개인 정보를 수집, 사용, 저장, 및 전송하게 됩니다. 또한, 이 경우 저희는 유저 약관과 프라이버시 정책, 기타 관련 규정, 혹은 팝업창이나 통지 등 방식을 통해 유저님의 관련 정보가 사용되는 목적이나 범위를 고지할 것입니다.

저희는 유저님이 제공해 주신 데이터의 안전을 매우 중요하게 생각하고 있습니다. 저희는 데이터 보안 기술과 프로그램에 대한 개발과 응용 업무를 담당하는 전담 부서를 설립했으며, 보안 관리 책임자와 주요 직책 상의 인원들에 대해 보안 배경 심사를 진행하게 됩니다. 아울러, 저희는 뛰어난 데이터 보안 관리 제도와 내부 보안 사건 처리 시스템 등을 구축해 두었습니다. 저희는 유저님의 데이터가 유실되거나, 인가받지 않은 주체에 의해 접근되거나, 외부에 의해 공개되고 사용, 훼손, 유실, 유출되는 사고를 방지하기 위해 업계 표준에 해당하는 보안 조치와 기술적 수단을 적절히 활용하여 유저님의 개인 정보를 보관 및 보호하게 됩니다. 저희는 합리적이고 실행 가능한 모든 조치들을 취하여 유저님의 개인 정보를 보호할 것입니다. 저희는 암호화 기술을 통해 데이터의 보안성을 보장할 것입니다; 저희는 신뢰받는 보호 시스템을 기반으로 유저님의 데이터를 악의적인 공격으로부터 보호할 것입니다.

저희는 내부 직원들에 대해 데이터 보안 의식 함양을 위한 교육을 진행하고 보안 인력에 대한 연수와 심사를 진행하여 개인 정보 보호의 중요성에 대한 임직원들의 인식을 강화할 것입니다. 저희는 개인 정보 처리를 담당하는 임직원들에 대해 신원 인증과 권한 통제를 진행하고 유저님의 개인 정보에 접근할 수 있는 임직원이나 협력 업체들에 대해 보안 서약을 요구할 것입니다. 또한, 저희는 각 직책의 관할 업무와 행동 수칙을 명확히 규정할 것이며, 이를 통해 인가를 받은 인원만이 유저님의 개인 정보에 접근할 수 있도록 통제할 것입니다. 보안 서약 관련 내용에 대한 위반 행위가 발생할 경우에는 당사와의 협력 관계가 그 즉시 중단되고 관련 법률적 책임을 묻게 되며, 개인 정보를 다루던 임직원들이 퇴사할 시에도 보안을 유지하도록 조치하고 있습니다.

유저님에게 주의의 말씀을 드립니다. 인터넷이 절대적으로 안전한 환경이라고는 할 수 없습니다. 유저님이 TeraBox에 기입하신 제3자 SNS 소프트웨어, 이메일, 문자 등을 통해 기타 유저와 지리적 위치와 사용 기록 등 정보들을 교환하게 될 경우에는 제3자 소프트웨어가 정보 전달에 있어 완벽한 암호화 작업을 진행하고 있는지 알기 어려우니 유저님의 개인 정보 보안에 만전을 기해주시기 바랍니다.

또한, 인터넷 업계에서는 기술적 한계와 기술의 빠른 발전, 그리고 충분히 존재할 수 있는 악의적인 공격 수단으로 인해 최선을 다해 보안 조치를 강화하더라도 언제나 유저님의 정보에 대한 100%의 안전성을 보장 드릴 수는 없습니다. 이 부분 양해 부탁드리겠습니다. 또한, 유저님이 저희의 제품이나 서비스를 이용하시면서 사용하시는 시스템이나 통신 네트워크 또한 저희의 통제 밖에 있는 요소로서 저희가 관여할 수 없는 부분에서 보안 문제가 발생할 가능성도 있습니다. 이 부분 역시 양해 부탁드립니다.

개인 정보 유출, 훼손, 혹은 유실 사태는 저희의 보안 관리 제도에 따라 초대형 안전사고로 규정되어 있으며, 이러한 사태가 발발할 경우 본사에서 최고 등급의 긴급 사태가 발령되며, 다수의 부서들이 연합 긴급 대응팀을 구성하여 이를 처리하게 됩니다.

저희는 인터넷 보안 사태 긴급 대응안을 제정하여 시스템 상의 허점, 컴퓨터 바이러스, 네트워크 공격, 네트워크 침입 등 보안 문제들에 대한 즉각적인 조치를 취할 것입니다. 네트워크 보안을 위협하는 사태가 발생할 시, 저희는 긴급 대응안을 활성화하여 상응하는 대응 조치를 취하고 규정에 따라 각 주관 부서에 보고를 진행하게 됩니다.

개인 정보 유출, 훼손, 유출 등 문제들은 본사가 규정하는 초대형 보안 사고이므로, 저희는 업무 팀의 구성원들에 대한 정기적인 보안 예비 훈련을 진행하여 이러한 사태의 발생을 방지하기 위해 책임을 다하겠습니다. 만일 그럼에도 이러한 사태가 발생했을 경우, 저희는 최우선적인 처리를 요하는 대응 태세를 발령하고 긴급 예비안을 발효하여 긴급 대응팀을 구성할 것이며, 최단 시간 내에 원인을 파악하고 손실을 최소화할 것입니다.

개인 정보에 대한 보안 사고가 발생하게 되면 저희는 법률 상 규정된 요구 사항에 따라 즉시 유저님께 보안 사고에 대한 기본적인 상황 설명을 진행하고 이에 따른 잠재적 영향, 저희 측의 대응 조치, 유저님께서 리스크 절감을 위해 취하실 수 있는 자체적인 조치, 유저님에 대한 지원 조치 등을 고지할 것입니다. 저희는 유저님이 기재해 주신 연락처를 기반으로 해당 사태에 대한 관련 상황을 웹페이지 상 고지, 문자 알림, 전화, 우편 등 방식을 통해 즉각적으로 고지해 드릴 것이며, 전체 인원에 대한 고지가 어려울 시에는 합리적이고 효과적인 방식으로 공고를 게시할 예정입니다. 또한, 저희는 감독 기관의 요구 사항에 따라 개인 정보 보안 사태에 대한 조치 현황을 자발적으로 보고할 것입니다. 법률 상 규정에 따르면, 저희가 취하는 조치들이 정보 유출, 왜곡, 유실 등에 따른 피해를 효과적으로 회피할 수 있을 경우에는 감독 기관이 별도로 유저님께 통지하지 않는 이상 저희는 유저님께 해당 개인 정보 보안 사태에 대한 통지를 하지 않도록 선택할 수 있습니다.

저희는 GDPR 측의 요구 사항을 참고하여 데이터 처리의 속성, 범위, 배경, 목적, 그리고 개인에 대해 일으킬 수 있는 위협 등을 고려하여 적절한 기술적 보안 조치를 취할 것이며, 이에 대한 정기적인 테스팅과 평가를 진행하여 저희가 취할 수 있는 조치들의 유효성을 유지할 것입니다.

데이터 유출 사건이 발생하게 되면 데이터 유출의 영향을 받게 되는 관련 인원들에게 최대한 빠르게 이를 고지할 것이며, 72시간 이내에 주관 부서에 해당 내용을 보고하게 됩니다. 72시간 내에 보고를 진행할 수 없을 경우에는 보고 연기 사유를 소명하게 됩니다.

저희는 적절한 기술적/조직적 조치들을 취해 데이터에 대한 보안 목표를 달성할 것이며, 데이터 최소화 및 필수적인 보장 조치 등을 데이터 처리 과정과 융합하여 데이터 주체의 각종 권리들을 보호하기 위해 기본적인 상황 하에서 특정 목적으로 진행되는 데이터 처리 절차가 반드시 필요한지의 여부를 확인할 것입니다.

유저님이 저희의 서비스에서 개인 정보를 삭제하실지라도 백업 시스템에 저장되어 있는 관련 정보들은 즉각적으로 삭제되지 않을 수 있습니다. 단, 백업이 갱신되면 해당 정보들이 삭제됩니다. 단, 법률 혹은 행정 법규 상의 규정이나 해당 프라이버시 정책 상에 설명된 보존 기간이 만료되지 않았거나 개인 정보 삭제가 기술적으로 실현되기 어려울 경우에는 저장 및 반드시 필요한 보안 조치를 제외한 기타 처리 작업을 중단하게 됩니다.

4\. 동의를 철회

Kami juga meminta Anda untuk memahami bahwa dalam industri Internet, karena keterbatasan dan pesatnya perkembangan teknologi, serta berbagai kemungkinan serangan jahat, meskipun kami berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk meningkatkan tindakan keamanan, kami juga tidak dapat selalu menjamin 100% keamanan informasi. Harap dipahami sistem dan jaringan komunikasi yang Anda gunakan untuk menggunakan produk dan/atau layanan kami mungkin akan menyebabkan masalah keamanan di sesi lain yang berada di luar kendali kami.

Menurut sistem manajemen keamanan kami, insiden kebocoran, kerusakan, atau kehilangan informasi pribadi termasuk insiden keamanan paling serius. Jika insiden tersebut terjadi, maka rencana darurat tingkat tertinggi perusahaan akan diaktifkan, dan akan ditangani oleh tim tanggap darurat gabungan yang terbentuk dari berbagai departemen.

Kami akan merumuskan rencana darurat untuk insiden keamanan jaringan, agar dapat menangani kerentanan sistem, virus komputer, serangan jaringan, intrusi jaringan dan risiko keamanan lainnya secara tepat waktu. Jika terjadi insiden yang membahayakan keamanan jaringan, kami akan segera mengaktifkan rencana darurat, mengambil tindakan perbaikan yang sesuai, dan melaporkan kepada departemen kompeten yang berkaitan sesuai dengan ketentuan.

Kebocoran, kerusakan, dan kehilangan informasi pribadi merupakan insiden keamanan serius di tingkat perusahaan. Kami akan bertanggung jawab untuk mengorganisir anggota tim kerja untuk melakukan latihan rencana keamanan secara rutin, agar dapat mencegah insiden keamanan tersebut terjadi. Jika terjadi kejadian yang merugikan, kami akan mengaktifkan rencana darurat sesuai dengan prioritas tertinggi, dan membentuk tim tanggap darurat untuk melacak penyebabnya dan mengurangi kerugian dalam waktu sesingkat mungkin.

Setelah terjadinya insiden keamanan informasi pribadi yang merugikan, kami akan segera memberitahu Anda tentang situasi dasar dan kemungkinan dampak insiden keamanan, tindakan penanganan yang telah diambil atau yang akan kami ambil, saranan untuk risiko yang dapat Anda cegah dan kurangi secara mandiri, dan tindakan perbaikan untuk Anda sesuai dengan persyaratan hukum dan peraturan. Kami akan segera memberitahu Anda tentang situasi kejadian yang berkaitan melalui pemberitahuan situs web, pemberitahuan SMS, telepon, email, dan metode kontak lain yang telah Anda berikan. Jika sulit untuk memberitahukannya satu per satu, kami akan mengambil metode yang wajar dan efektif untuk mempublikasikan pengumuman. Sementara itu, kami juga akan berinisiatif untuk melaporkan situasi penanganan insiden keamanan informasi pribadi sesuai dengan persyaratan departemen pengawasan. Harap dipahami bahwa, sesuai dengan ketentuan hukum dan peraturan, jika tindakan yang kami ambil dapat secara efektif menghindari kerugian yang timbul dari kebocoran, perusakan dan kehilangan informasi, kami dapat memilih untuk tidak memberitahukan insiden keamanan informasi pribadi tersebut kepada Anda, kecuali departemen pengawasan meminta kami untuk memberitahu Anda.

Kami akan memilih tindakan perlindungan keamanan teknis yang sesuai berdasarkan sifat, ruang lingkup, latar belakang, serta tujuan pemrosesan data dan risiko terhadap individu dengan mengacu pada persyaratan GDPR, dan melakukan pengujian dan evaluasi rutin terhadap tindakan tersebut untuk menjaga efektivitas tindakan yang diambil.

Saat terjadi kebocoran data, kami akan memberitahu grup pengguna yang terkena dampak kebocoran informasi tersebut sesegera mungkin, dan kami akan melaporkannya kepada departemen kompeten yang terkait dalam waktu 72 jam. Jika tidak dapat melaporkannya dalam waktu 72 jam, maka kami akan menjelaskan penyebab keterlambatan penyampaian laporan.

Мы можем передавать для общего доступа Ваши данные третьим сторонам

Мы можем использовать некоторых доверенных третьих лиц (таких как служба поддержки клиентов и поставщики ИТ-услуг) для помощи в лучшем предоставлении, оптимизации, защите и продвижении наших услуг.

Мы будем ссылаться на требования GDPR для создания экспортного механизма для трансграничной передачи данных и своевременно обновлять его трансграничный механизм на основе требований GDPR. Любая обработка персональных данных будет соответствовать положениям основных принципов GDPR с получением согласия действующего субъекта данных или соответствием другим законным причинам. Помимо этого, будут созданы дополнительные механизмы для защиты данных в соответствии с основными требованиями GDPR касательно обработки данных.

Каким образом мы защищаем и храним Ваши данные

У нас есть команда, занимающаяся сохранением вашей информации в безопасности и ее тестированием на наличие уязвимостей. В дополнение к двойной аутентификации, отключению шифрования файлов и оповещениям, когда новые устройства и приложения подключаются к вашему аккаунту, мы продолжим работать над обеспечением безопасности вашей информации. Мы внедряем автоматизированные технологии для обнаружения злоупотреблений и контента, которые могут нанести вред нашим сервисам, вам или другим пользователям.

При регистрации аккаунта TeraBox, до тех пор, пока ваш аккаунт существует или нам необходимо предоставлять вам услуги, мы будем хранить информацию, которую вы сохранили на наших сервисах. Если вы хотите удалить свой аккаунт, пожалуйста, отправьте электронное письмо с просьбой удалить вашу информацию на адрес [helpdesk@terabox.com](mailto:helpdesk@terabox.com), при этом мы выполним ваш запрос в течение 30 дней после получения вашего эл. письма; однако: (1) мы не будем удалять информацию вашего аккаунта до подтверждения вашей личности пользователя; (2) удаление наших серверов и резервное хранилище может быть отложено, (3) при необходимости мы можем сохранить эту информацию для выполнения наших юридических обязательств, разрешения споров или обеспечения соблюдения наших прав по контракту.

Мы будем сохранять ваши личные данные в течение срока, необходимого для оказания услуг, но если законами и нормативными актами установлен иной срок хранения, вы согласны сохранить на более длительный срок, обеспечить безопасность и качество услуг, достичь цели разрешения споров, технически трудно выполнить и т.д., мы будем продлевать срок хранения по закону, по соглашению или в разумных пределах после истечения вышеуказанного срока хранения информации.

По истечении срока хранения мы удалим ваши личные данные или проведем анонимную обработку в соответствии с законодательством, мы будем собирать, использовать, хранить и передавать информацию пользователей в соответствии с принципом «минимального вмешательства» и будем информировать вас о цели и объеме использования соответствующей информации с помощью пользовательского соглашения и политики конфиденциальности, а также соответствующих правил, всплывающих окон, уведомлений и т.д.

Мы придаем большое значение информационной безопасности. Мы учредили специальную команду, которая будет отвечать за исследования, разработку и применение различных технологий и процедур безопасности. Мы будем тщательно рассматривать биографию руководителей служб безопасности и ключевых сотрудников службы безопасности. Мы создали надежную систему управления информационной безопасностью и механизм обработки инцидентов внутренней безопасности. Наряду с этим, мы примем соответствующие меры безопасности и технические средства, соответствующие отраслевым стандартам, для хранения и защиты вашей личной информации, чтобы предотвратить ее потерю, несанкционированный доступ, публичное раскрытие, использование, повреждение, утрату или разглашение. Мы примем все рациональные и осуществимые меры для защиты вашей личной информации. Мы будем использовать технологию шифрования для обеспечения конфиденциальности данных; а также, использовать надежные механизмы защиты для предотвращения вредоносных атак в отношении данных.

Мы будем обучать и оценивать осведомленность сотрудников о безопасности данных и возможностях обеспечения безопасности, чтобы повысить их осведомленность о важности защиты личной информации. Мы проведем аутентификацию личности и контроль полномочий для сотрудников, которые обрабатывают личную информацию, и при этом подпишем соглашения о конфиденциальности с сотрудниками и партнерами, которые обращаются к вашей личной информации, чтобы уточнить должностные обязанности и кодексы поведения для гарантии того, чтобы только уполномоченный персонал мог получить доступ к личной информации. В случае любого нарушения соглашения о конфиденциальности отношения сотрудничества с компанией будут немедленно прекращены, при этом будут расследованы соответствующие юридические обязательства. Персонал, который контактирует с личной информацией, также будет обязан сохранять конфиденциальность при уходе со своих постов.

Мы напоминаем вам, что Интернет не является абсолютно безопасной средой. При взаимодействии с другими пользователями через стороннее социальное программное обеспечение, эл. почту, СМС и т. д., встроенные в TeraBox, когда вы не уверены, полностью ли стороннее программное обеспечение шифрует передачу информации, обращайте внимание на обеспечение безопасности вашей личной информации.

Мы также просим вас понять, что в Интернет-индустрии из-за ограничений и быстрого развития технологий и различных возможных вредоносных атак, даже если мы изо всех сил стараемся усилить меры безопасности, мы не всегда можем гарантировать 100%-ную безопасность информации. Пожалуйста, поймите, что система и коммуникационная сеть, которые вы используете при использовании наших продуктов и/ или услуг, могут вызвать проблемы безопасности в других каналах, находящихся вне нашего контроля.

Согласно нашей системе управления безопасностью, случаи разглашения, уничтожения или потери персональных данных относятся к наиболее серьезным инцидентам в области безопасности. В случае возникновения таких инцидентов, будет запущен план аварийного реагирования на самом высоком уровне компании, который будет рассматриваться совместной группой аварийного реагирования, состоящей из нескольких департаментов.

Мы разрабатываем план аварийного реагирования на инциденты сетевой безопасности, своевременно устраняем пробелы в системе, компьютерные вирусы, кибератаки, сетевые вторжения и другие риски безопасности. При возникновении инцидентов, угрожающих кибербезопасности, мы немедленно запустим план аварийного реагирования, примем соответствующие меры по исправлению и сообщим соответствующим компетентным органам согласно требованиям.

Разглашение, уничтожение и потеря персональных данных относятся к исключительно серьезным инцидентам в области безопасности на уровне компании, мы отвечаем за организацию регулярных тренировок по безопасности для членов рабочей группы в целях предотвращения таких инцидентов. В случае возникновения какого-либо инцидента мы запустим план действий в чрезвычайных ситуациях в соответствии с наивысшим приоритетом и сформируем группу реагирования на чрезвычайные ситуации, чтобы отследить причины и сократить потери в кратчайшие сроки.

В случае неприятного инцидента с безопасностью личной информации мы, в соответствии с требованиями законов и нормативных актов, незамедлительно проинформируем вас об основной ситуации и возможных последствиях инцидента с безопасностью, мерах по обработке, которые мы приняли или будем принимать, предложениях о рисках, которые вы можете предотвратить и уменьшить, и мерах по исправлению положения. Мы своевременно проинформируем вас о соответствующей информации о мероприятии в форме уведомления на месте, СМС-уведомления, связи по телефону, по эл. почте и по другой контактной информации, которую вы зарезервировали. При наличии трудности извещения, мы выберем рациональный и эффективный способ публикации объявления. Наряду с этим, мы будем активно сообщать об устранении инцидентов личной информационной безопасности в соответствии с требованиями регулирующих органов. Пожалуйста, поймите, что в соответствии с положениями законов и нормативных актов, если принимаемые нами меры могут эффективно избежать вреда, причиненного раскрытием информации, подделкой и потерей, если только регулирующий орган не потребует, чтобы вы были уведомлены, мы можем принять решение не уведомлять вас об инциденте с безопасностью личной информации.

Мы будем ссылаться на требования GDPR, выбирать соответствующие технические меры защиты безопасности, исходя из характера, объема, предыстории и цели обработки данных, а также рисков для отдельных лиц, и проводить регулярное тестирование и оценку их для поддержания эффективности принятых мер.

При возникновении разглашения данных, мы как можно скорее уведомим соответствующие группы пользователей, пострадавших от утечки информации, и сообщим в соответствующий компетентный отдел в течение 72 часов. В случае невозможности составления отчета в течение 72 часов, будет объяснена причина задержки.

Мы принимаем соответствующие технические и организационные меры для достижения целей защиты данных, таких как сведение к минимуму объема данных и включение необходимых мер предосторожности в процесс обработки данных для защиты прав субъектов данных. По умолчанию мы гарантируем, что данные, обрабатываемые для определенных целей, необходимы.

Hemos establecido un equipo responsable especialmente para desarrollar y aplicar una variedad de tecnologías y procedimientos de seguridad, etc. Llevaremos a cabo una revisión de los antecedentes de seguridad de los responsables de gestión de seguridad y del personal de los puestos clave de seguridad. Hemos establecido un sistema integral de gestión de seguridad de la información y un mecanismo interno de tratamiento de los incidentes de seguridad. Tomamos una serie de medidas de seguridad tecnológicas que cumplen las normas del sector para guardar y proteger sus datos, a fin de que no sean objeto de acceso no autorizado, ni de divulgación pública, ni de uso, ni de modificación, ni de daños ni de pérdida. Tomamos todas las medidas razonables y factibles para proteger sus datos personales. Utilizaremos la tecnología de encriptación para garantizar la confidencialidad de los datos; utilizaremos un mecanismo de protección de confianza para evitar ataques maliciosos a los datos.

Formaremos la conciencia del personal sobre la seguridad de los datos, y realizaremos la capacitación y evaluación de la capacidad de seguridad del personal, para mejorar su conciencia sobre la importancia de proteger la información personal. Autenticaremos la identidad y controlaremos los permisos para el personal que trata la información personal, y firmaremos un acuerdo de confidencialidad con el personal y los socios que acceden a su información personal, para aclarar las responsabilidades laborales y los códigos de conducta, garantizando así que solo las personas autorizadas tengan acceso a la información personal. En caso de una violación del acuerdo de confidencialidad, la asociación con la empresa se dará por terminada inmediatamente, y se investigará la responsabilidad legal pertinente. También habrá requisitos de confidencialidad para el personal que accede a la información personal cuando este abandone este trabajo.

Le recordamos que el entorno de Internet no es 100% seguro. Cuando usted intercambia su ubicación geográfica o información de seguimiento con otros usuarios, a través de software de redes sociales de terceros integrado en TeraBox, correo electrónico, SMS, etc., no se podrá garantizar que el software de terceros encripte completamente para la transmisión de información, por lo que debe tener cuidado para garantizar la seguridad de su información personal.

También le pedimos que comprenda que, en la industria de Internet, debido a las limitaciones tecnológicas y al rápido desarrollo y los posibles ataques maliciosos, es imposible garantizar siempre al 100% la seguridad de la información, incluso si hacemos todo lo posible para mejorar las medidas de seguridad. Por favor, comprenda que los sistemas y las redes de comunicación que utiliza al usar nuestros productos y/o servicios podrían tener problemas de seguridad más allá de nuestro control.

De acuerdo con nuestro sistema de gestión de seguridad, la divulgación, el daño o la pérdida de información personal se clasifica como incidente de seguridad más importante. Una vez ocurrido, se iniciará el plan de emergencia de nivel más alto de la empresa, y se formará un equipo conjunto de respuesta a emergencias por varios departamentos para tratarlo.

Formularemos un plan de contingencia para incidentes de seguridad de las redes, y eliminaremos a tiempo los riesgos de seguridad tales como las vulnerabilidades del sistema, el virus del computador, el ataque a la red, la intrusión a la red, etc. En caso de un incidente que ponga en peligro la seguridad de la red, inmediatamente activaremos el plan de contingencia, y tomaremos las medidas correctivas correspondientes, e informaremos a las autoridades pertinentes según las disposiciones pertinentes.

La divulgación, el daño o la pérdida de información personal se clasifica como incidente de seguridad más importante de la empresa. Seremos responsables de organizar regularmente a los miembros del grupo de trabajo para realizar simulacros de planes de seguridad, para evitar tales incidentes de seguridad. En caso de un incidente, activaremos el plan de contingencia como la más alta prioridad, y formaremos un equipo de contingencia para rastrear la causa y reducir la pérdida en el menor tiempo posible.

Si, desafortunadamente, se produjera un incidente de seguridad de la información personal, según los requisitos de las leyes y los reglamentos, le informaremos sin demora la situación general del incidente de seguridad y su posible impacto, las medidas de eliminación que hemos tomado o tomaremos, las recomendaciones que usted puede hacer para prevenir y reducir el riesgo de forma independiente, y las medidas correctivas para usted. Le comunicaremos inmediatamente el incidente por notificación de la estación, mensaje, teléfono, correo electrónico u otras formas de contacto que usted reserva. Cuando sea difícil informar a los sujetos de la información uno por uno, adoptaremos medios razonables y eficaces para emitir anuncios. También tomaremos la iniciativa de informar sobre el tratamiento de los incidentes de seguridad de la información, tal y como exigen las autoridades reguladoras. Por favor, comprenda que de acuerdo con las leyes y los reglamentos, si las medidas que tomamos puedan evitar efectivamente la divulgación, la alteración o la pérdida de la información, podemos optar por no informarle sobre el incidente de seguridad de la información personal, a menos que las autoridades reguladoras solicite informarle.

Nos referiremos a los requisitos de GDPR, y optaremos por las medidas de protección de la seguridad técnica adecuadas en función de la naturaleza, el alcance, el contexto y la finalidad de los datos tratados, así como del riesgo que supone para la persona, y probaremos y evaluaremos regularmente para mantener la eficacia de las medidas adoptadas.

Tan pronto como se produzca la divulgación de datos, notificaremos al grupo de personas afectadas por la divulgación de información lo antes posible, y dentro de las 72 horas informaremos a las autoridades competentes pertinentes. Cuando no podamos informarle dentro de las 72 horas, indicaremos el motivo de la demora.

Tomamos las medidas técnicas y organizativas apropiadas para lograr objetivos de protección de datos, tales como la minimización de datos y la integración de las salvaguardas necesarias en el tratamiento de datos, para proteger los derechos del interesado de datos. Por defecto, son necesarios los datos tratados para un propósito específico.

نحن نهتم اهتماماً جاد بأمن المعلومات. ولهذا أنشأنا فريقًا خاصًا ليكون مسؤول عن عملية تطوير وتطبيق مجموعة التقنيات وإجراءات الأمان المختلفة، كما أننا نجري فحوصات أمنية على كل من قادة الإدارة الأمنية والموظفين العاملين في المناصب الكبرى المتعلقة بالأمن، وفي الوقت نفسه قد أنشأنا نظام متكامل خاص بإدارة أمن المعلومات وكما وضعنا آلية للتعامل مع الحوادث الأمنية الداخلية. وبهذا فإننا سنخزن المعلومات الشخصية الخاصة بك ونحميها من خلال التدابير الأمنية المثلى والوسائل التقنية المناسبة التي تتوافق مع معايير الصناعة، وذلك لتجنب ضياعها أو الوصول غير المصرح به لها أو الإفصاح العلني عنها أو استخدامها بشكل غير مناسب أو تلفها أو فقدها أو ترسيبها. كما أننا سنتخذ كافة الإجراءات العملية العقلانية لحماية معلوماتك الشخصية. وبجانب هذا، سوف نستخدم تقنية التشفير من أجل ضمان سرية البيانات، وسوف نستخدم أيضاً آليات حماية موثوقة لمن أجل حماية البيانات من الهجمات التي قد تضر بها.

وسنقوم بتدريب وتقييم وعي الموظفين فيما يتعلق بأمان البيانات والقدرات الأمنية، وذلك لتعزيز وعيهم بأهمية حماية المعلومات الشخصية الخاصة بالمستخدمين. وبالإضافة إلى ذلك يتم إجراء مصادقة للهوية ومراقبة سلطة الموظفين المعنين بالتعامل مع المعلومات الشخصية، وتوقيع اتفاقات السرية مع كل من الموظفين وشركاء التعاون الذي يتعاملون بشكل مباشر بمعلوماتك الشخصية، والقيام بتوضيح مسؤوليات العمل وقواعد السلوك لهم، والتأكد من أن الموظفين المصرح لهم فقط هم من لديهم إمكانية الوصول إلى المعلومات الشخصية الخاصة بك. وفي حالة حدوث أي انتهاك لاتفاقيات السرية تلك، سيتم على الفور وبدون تردد إنهاء علاقة التعاون مع الشركة المنتهكة، كما سيتم مقاضاتهم طبقا للمسؤوليات القانونية ذات الصلة المتفق عليها، وبالطبع سيُطلب أيضًا من الموظفين الذين كان لديهم صلاحية الوصول إلى المعلومات الشخصية الاستمرار في الحفاظ على سرية تلك المعلومات حتى بعد ترك وظائفهم.

وهنا نؤكد عليك عزيزي المستخدم أن الإنترنت لا يعتبر بيئة آمنة تمامًا، ولذا عندما تتعامل مع مستخدمين آخرين من خلال برنامج اجتماعي تابع لطرف ثالث مُدرج في TeraBox أو من خلال البريد الإلكتروني أو الرسائل القصيرة وما إلى ذلك من الوسائل الأخرى وتشارك معهم معلومات حول موقعك الجغرافي أو معلومات التتبع الخاصة بك، لن يكون من المؤكد حينها أن يلتزم البرنامج التابع للطرف الثالث هذا بالتشفير الكامل لنقل المعلومات، أو أنه سيهتم بضمان أمان معلوماتك الشخصية.

كما نرجو أيضًا أن تتفهم أنه في مجال صناعة الإنترنت، حتى لو بذلنا قصارى جهدنا لتعزيز تدابير الأمان الخاصة بنا سيكون من المستحيل ضمان أمان المعلومات بنسبة 100%، وذلك نظرًا للتطور السريع للتكنولوجيا والقيود الخاصة بها والاحتمالية الدائمة بوجود وسائل للهجوم الضار بأنواعها المختلفة. كما يرجى العلم أن أنظمة وشبكات اتصال التي تستخدمها للتعامل مع منتجاتنا و/ أو خدماتنا قد تحدث بها مشكلات أمنية في دوائر خارجة عن سيطرتنا.

وطبقاً لنظام إدارة الأمن الخاص بنا، يتم تصنيف حوادث تسرب أو تلف أو ضياع المعلومات الشخصية على أنها أخطر الحوادث الأمنية. وبمجرد وقوع أي حادث منها، سيتم على الفور بدء تنفيذ أعلى خطة طوارئ بالشركة، وسيتم التعامل مع من قبل فريق الاستجابة للطوارئ الذي يتم تشكيله من إدارات متعددة.

ومن المقرر القيام بصياغة خطة طوارئ خاصة بحوادث أمان الشبكات، وذلك لتوفر القدرة على التعامل الفوري مع ثغرات النظام وفيروسات الكمبيوتر وهجوم الشبكات وحوادث الاختراق وغيرهم من المخاطر الأمنية الأخرى، والإجراءات العلاجية وإبلاغ السلطات المختصة وفقًا للوائح. وفي حالة وقوع حادث يهدد الأمن الشبكات، سيتم على الفور بدء تنفيذ خطة طوارئ المعنية، واتخاذ كافة التدابير المناسبة، وإبلاغ السلطات المختصة وفقًا للوائح ذات الصلة.

ولأن تسرب وتلف وفقد المعلومات الشخصية للمستخدمين من أخطر الحوادث الأمنية على مستوى الشركة، فنحن مسؤولين عن تنظيم تدريب بشكل دوري للموظفين على التدريبات الأمنية المتعلقة، وذلك من أجل منع حدوث مثل تلك الحوادث الأمنية الخطيرة. وفي حالة حدوث حادث مؤسف منهم، سيتم على الفور بدء تنفيذ خطة الاستجابة للطوارئ، وتشكيل فريق استجابة للطوارئ، وذلك من أجل تتبع السبب الذ أدى إلى وقوع الحادث وتقليل الضرر الناجم في أسرع وقت ممكن.

وبحالة وقوع حادث مؤسف يتعلق بأمن المعلومات الشخصية الخاصة بك، سنقوم فوراً بإبلاغك وفقًا لمتطلبات القوانين واللوائح بكل من: الظروف الأساسي للحادث والتأثير المحتمل لذلك الحادث الأمني، بالإضافة إلى التدابير التي اتخذناها أو سنتخذها للتعامل معه، وتقديم اقتراحات متعلقة بالمخاطر التي يمكنك منعها وتقليلها بنفسك، وغير ذلك من التدابير الإصلاحية التي يمكنك اتباعها، إلخ. وسيتم ذلك الإبلاغ الفور بالمعلومات ذات الصلة من خلال إشعارات الموقع أو الرسائل القصيرة أو المكالمات الهاتفية أو البريد الإلكتروني أو غير ذلك من معلومات الاتصال الأخرى التي كنت قد قدمتها لنا. وفي حالة تعثر إبلاغ كل مستخدم على حدى بالواقعة حينها، فسوف يتم الإعلان العام عنها بطريقة فعالة وعقلانية. كما أننا في الوقت نفسه، سنقوم وفقًا لمتطلبات السلطات التنظيمية بالمبادرة بالإبلاغ الفوري عن أي حوادث تتعلق بأمن المعلومات الشخصية. ويرجى العلم أنه وفقًا للقوانين واللوائح، إذا كانت الإجراءات التي سنقوم باتخاذها يمكنها أن تتجنب بشكل فعال الضرر الذي نجم عن حوادث تسريب وفقدان المعلومات والعبث بها، فبإمكاننا اختيار عدم إبلاغك بتلك الحوادث، ما لم تحتم السلطة التنظيمية علينا إبلاغك.

وأننا سوف نتخذ من متطلبات اللائحة العامة لحماية البيانات (GDPR) مرجع لنا، ونقوم بتحديد تدابير الأمان التقنية الملائمة بناءً على كل من: طبيعة البيانات التي تتم معالجتها ونطاقها وسياقها والغرض منها، بالإضافة إلى المخاطر التي يتعرض لها الأفراد. وبجانب ذلك سوف يتم إجراء الاختبارات والتقييمات بشكل منتظم لهذه التدابير المتخذة، وذلك للحفاظ على فاعليتها.

وعند وقع حادث تسريب للبيانات، سنقوم في أسرع وقت بإبلاغ الأشخاص المعنيين المتأثرين بالحادث، كما سنقوم في غضون 72 ساعة بإبلاغ الإدارة المختصة ذات الصلة. وفي حالة تعذر تقديم التقرير المتعلق في غضون 72 ساعة، فسيتم شرح سبب تأخير التقرير.

وبالتأكيد نحن نتخذ كافة التدابير الفنية والتنظيمية المناسبة لتحقيق هدف حماية البيانات، وذلك مثل: تقليل البيانات إلى الحد الأدنى وإدماج الضمانات اللازمة في عملية معالجة البيانات، وذلك من أجل حماية حقوق موضوعات البيانات، وضرورة التأكد من أن معالجة البيانات تتم لأغراض معينة.

Chúng tôi rất chú trọng an toàn thông tin. Chúng tôi đã thành lập nhóm chuyên phụ trách và chịu trách nhiệm nghiên cứu phát triển và ứng dụng nhiều loại công nghệ và quy trình an toàn..., chúng tôi sẽ thực hiện thẩm tra lý lịch an toàn đối với người phụ trách quản lý an toàn và nhân viên giữ chức vụ an toàn quan trọng, chúng tôi đã thành lập hệ thống quản lý an toàn thông tin và cơ chế xử lý tình huống an toàn nội bộ hoàn thiện.
