We collect personal information directly from you when you visit and interact with the Site, as we buy media to build consumer awareness, and when you when you open and/or click on email advertisements, as well as if you request to unsubscribe from receiving future email advertisements from us.  
  
The types of personal information that we collect automatically through the Site include: (i) your IP address; (ii) referring web page; (iii) your age range; (iv) cookies, beacons, pixel tags, and mobile ad identifiers; and (v) geolocation data. Our servers automatically recognize your IP address each time you visit the Site and the web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you to and to better tailor our product and service offerings contained within the Site. Your IP address can also be used to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer the Site. We also collect additional personal information which you submit to us through the Site including: (i) your first name; (ii) your last name; (iii) your email address; (iv) your telephone number; and (v) any other information requested in a web form contained on the Site.  
  
The first time that a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at the Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the applicable user's PC. A cookie is a small data text file, which is stored on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies make your use of the Site easier, make the Site run more smoothly, and help us to maintain a secure Site. The cookies may collect information about you, such as the referring website address, your IP address, your browser type and version, your Internet service provider, the area code and zip code associated with your server, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on the Site. Whenever a user comes back to the Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the user and to recall the users e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities on the Site (such as name, address, etc.), we may store that information, along with a user's e-mail address, in our database. We may use the information stored in our database: (i) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Site; (iii) to pre-populate information fields in the event that user wishes to purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other offers in the future; (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that user; or to track your use of the Site, and to customize the content that you might see on the Site. To disable and reject cookies, adjust the settings via the options menu of your Internet browser. Many web browsers offer their users to opt to not be tracked, however unless otherwise required by law, we do not guarantee that we will respond to such Do Not Track signals.  
  
Other methods of tracking: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif/pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements and/or other information on the Site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of the Site and to provide information about what products/services are viewed or purchased. We reserve the right to retain this cookie and action tag data indefinitely, and to share information generated by these cookies and action tags with our advertisers, affiliates and service providers.  
  
We also collect personal information through advertising networks, internet service providers (ISPs), operating systems, and social networks.

Where you indicate the desire to receive certain offers, products or services from a third party during the applicable information collection process, your personal information that was provided during the information collection process will be shared with the applicable third party so that such third party may provide their product or service to you and so that you do not have to complete another information collection form to purchase or receive that product or service.

Your email will be shared with our preferred mailing partner and other brands believed to be of interest to you for the purpose of sending third party promotional email communication. You may unsubscribe from any such emails at any time.  
  
We use demographic information to tailor the Site to the interests of our users. Demographic data may be shared with third parties including our third party advertisers so that they can tailor their advertisements to the appropriate audience.

By submitting your information through the Site, you agree to allow us to provide such aggregate data to third parties. By agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate.

By registering at the Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR § 310 et seq.), as amended from time to time and applicable state do-not-call regulations.

Security Precautions  
  
The privacy of your personal information is very important to us. As such, we endeavor to safeguard our users' personal information. When users make personal information available to us, their personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any personal information offline). Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is not accessible to the public. The servers that we store personal information on are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your personal information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software constitutes a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot guarantee or warrant that your personal information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through the Site is at your own risk.  
  
All of our users' personal information is restricted in our offices. Only employees or third party agents who need the personal information to perform a specific job function are granted access to personal information. Employees not adhering to our policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
