### **2.Provision of the Services**[](#2provision-of-the-services "Link to this heading")

#### 2.1.Services[](#21services "Link to this heading")

The main service rendered by Platform.sh is a PaaS—a Platform-as-a-Service—that helps customers develop, deploy, host, monitor, and maintain Your applications (Your “**Project(s)**”). For the duration of this Agreement, Platform.sh will allow You to access and use the Platform.sh PaaS service (the “**Services**”).

Platform.sh will make the Services available to You pursuant to this Agreement and the documentation relating to the applicable Service, which is available under [https://docs.platform.sh/](https://docs.platform.sh/), or available under [https://docs.upsun.com/](https://docs.upsun.com/) for the Upsun service (the “**Documentation**”).

#### 2.2.Account Registration [](#22account-registration "Link to this heading")

When creating an account (“**Account**”) with us and for as long as You use our Services, You must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. You will not give false or misleading information about You and, upon Platform.sh request, You will provide any additional information as reasonably needed by Platform.sh to verify Your identity as a customer. 

Upon creating an Account, an organization (“**Organization**”) will be created to group Your Projects and Users (as defined below) together for billing and administration purposes. You can create additional Organizations upon discretion to organize Your Projects and Users at Your convenience.  Limits may apply to the number of Organizations and Users You may create.

**2.3.Administration of the Service**

Through Your Account, You can access the web administration console (the “**Console**”), and, and subject to Your permission level, (i) manage Your Organization, add or remove Projects or resources; (ii) manage and update Your information; (iii)  permit any individual that is at least 16 or age of majority whichever is greater and that is Your employee,  agent, contractor or representative to access, use, and/or manage the Services (“**User**”), (iv) configure the access controls of Your Users, (v) manage Your subscription, and (vi) review information on Your usage of the Services. 

For clarification purposes, the Services can also be managed by You and Your Authorized Users through a Command Line Interface tool (the “**CLI**”), APIs, and integrations with third-party tools. 

Changes to Your Projects, resources, or Users may incur additional costs. You acknowledge and agree that any such change made by You or by any User with adequate permission level may result in additional charges and fees being billed by Platform.sh as further detailed on the Console or in the Documentation.

#### 2.4.Administration of Users[](#24administration-of-users "Link to this heading")

You are responsible for managing Your User’s access rights and making sure that said access rights are up to date at all times. You will ensure that User login and other  credentials are kept confidential, are individual, and are not shared between several individuals. You and Your Users must comply with the Acceptable Use Policy and applicable laws. You are responsible and liable to Platform.sh for the acts and omissions of Your Users, and are responsible for each User’s compliance with this Agreement. You will notify us immediately and terminate the relevant person’s access to the Services should you become aware of (i) any breach of this Agreement by a User or (ii) any possible misuse of a User’s credentials.

#### 2.5.Content [](#25content "Link to this heading")

The Services, and especially the PaaS hosting services, give You the opportunity to develop, test, scale, and host Your Projects and all information and content in relation or connection with Your Projects, including without limitation related data files, written text, software or program source code, pictures, music, audio or video files, or other images or material (individually and all together Your “**Content**”).

You are solely responsible for Your and Your User’s use and submission of all Content as part or through the use of the Services. Before posting, uploading, sharing, storing, running, providing, or otherwise submitting Content subject to intellectual property rights—like, but not limited to, trademark, copyright, or patent—to the Services, You must make sure such Content is validly licensed to You for the intended use. You are solely liable for complying with the license agreements of the software and programs included in Your Content. 

If Your Projects developed or hosted on the Services allow for third parties (for example,  but not limited to the users of Your application or website hosted on Platform.sh) to publish, transmit, or host Content, You acknowledge and agree that You are solely responsible for any applicable legal requirement to review such Content for possible breaches of this Agreement, or possible violation of any applicable law or regulation, including any law or regulation related to the protection of personal data, and to promptly remove such Content where applicable. 

You represent and warrant that Your Content does not (i) breach any provision of  this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, (ii) infringe or misappropriate the rights of any third party, or (iii) breach applicable law or regulation, including any law or regulation related to the protection of personal data. 

You agree to immediately remove any Content that breaches this Agreement upon first request of Platform.sh or upon becoming aware of any such breach. Platform.sh reserves the right, but shall be under no obligation, to suspend or delete any Project which includes Content in breach of this Agreement, at its sole discretion. You acknowledge that Platform.sh does not have the capacity or the obligation to intervene directly with Your Content and as such that any such removal befalls solely on You.

Applicable law may require You to publish Content together with Your name, address, telephone number, and email address to which questions, complaints, or claims from users should be directed, as well as any further information eventually required under applicable law. To the extent these requirements apply to You, You agree to comply with applicable law and publish any required information together with Your Content.

### **3.Tier and Services specifications**[](#3tier-and-services-specifications "Link to this heading")

Organization tier, service offering, and available capacity, storage, resources, add-ons, and containers are described in the Documentation. 

As further detailed in the Documentation, some services and add-ons may come with specific usage limits. Depending on the Organization tier, service, or add-on elected and used by You, usage in excess may not be allowed by Platform.sh or may be allowed as overage and subject to billing. 

### **4.Support and uptime**[](#4support-and-uptime "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh will make commercially reasonable efforts to make sure the uptime of the hosting infrastructure of Your Projects on production environment reaches or exceeds 99.5% monthly. The best efforts uptime commitment mentioned above does not apply to development and test environments and is exclusive of all interruptions for maintenance purposes and incidents caused by Your Projects (e.g. Project that exceeds the allocated resources, contains a programming error, failure to apply updates) and/or caused by failure of TLS certificates provided by You.  

Unless otherwise agreed in writing between You and Platform.sh, the Services do not include specific support obligations. However, Platform.sh will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide You with support services through an online service desk and on public forums.

### **5.Maintenance** [](#5maintenance "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh reserves the right to interrupt part or all of the Services to perform a technical intervention for the purpose of ensuring the proper operation of the Services, and the safety and stability of the infrastructure behind the Services. Platform.sh will make commercially reasonable efforts to limit the occurrence and duration of the interruption and, where feasible, will give You reasonable prior notice of Platform.sh interventions.

### **6.Changes to the Services**[](#6changes-to-the-services "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh reserves the rights, in its sole discretion, to modify, add, or remove portions and/or functionality of the Service on a temporary or permanent basis, without liability to you or any third party. Except where an urgent change is required for security reasons, Platform.sh will notify You ahead of any negatively impacting material change by displaying a prominent notice within the Services and/or by sending You an email, to the extent that You subscribed to receive email updates.  You may object to any material change that has an adverse effect on Your use of the Services by, as Your sole and exclusive remedy, terminating Your subscription, discontinuing your use of the Services and canceling all Your Projects. Your continued use of the Services after such material change will constitute your consent to such changes. New features and services will also be subject to this Agreement. 

### **7.Beta Features**[](#7beta-features "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh may occasionally offer You to try, at your option, certain beta or pre-release features still undergoing [testing](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/testing) and that are not generally available (each a “**Beta Feature**”). Beta Features are for evaluation purposes and are not intended for production use. Beta Features do not come with any uptime commitment, or support obligation. You understand and agree that (i) You can agree or decline any such trial of Beta Feature, and (ii) any of these Beta Features may be modified, removed, or discontinued, or made generally available to all our customers for production use (incl. for a fee) at our sole discretion, for any reason and without any liability of Platform.sh to You. All Beta Features are provided "AS IS,'' without warranty or representation of any kind. Notwithstanding section Liability, Platform.sh’s liability for any damage arising out of or in connection with any Beta Feature is excluded in entirety, including any obligation or liability with respect to Your Content, except to the extent liability cannot be limited under applicable law. You assume all risks associated with Your use of a Beta Feature.

### **8.Sponsored Projects**[](#8sponsored-projects "Link to this heading")

From time to time, at its sole discretion, Platform.sh may sponsor Your use of the Services and hosting of Your Project(s). You understand and agree that such a sponsored use (i) must comply with this Agreement, regardless of whether You pay for the Services or not, (ii) may have limited features and resource, and (iii) may be reviewed and terminated by Platform.sh at its sole discretion, for any reason and without any liability to You. 

Sponsored Projects on production environments are expected to display a widget “Powered by Platform.sh.” Platform.sh may update such a widget's contents from time to time, and You will update Your Project in a timely fashion. You may request variations of the widget as long as such variations have written pre-approval from Platform.sh, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or fall within branding guidelines provided by Platform.sh. Platform.sh further reserves the right to announce on its own media presence, both online and offline, such sponsored Project hosting and may kindly ask You to communicate the same (at least once) over Your social media presence (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn).

### **9.Free trial**[](#9free-trial "Link to this heading")

If You are a first-time user of our Services, you can elect to sign up for a free-trial period.  Your use of the Services during the free-trial period must comply with this Agreement and be limited to internal evaluation and testing of the Services for the sole purpose of determining whether the Services meets your requirements and whether You wish to continue using the Services. 

Services provided under the free trial may have limited features and resources, may be limited to development environments, and should not be used for production purposes. 

Platform.sh reserves the right to determine Your eligibility for a free trial at its sole discretion. Platform.sh can deny your request for a free trial if it suspects You are trying to receive additional free-trial benefits. 

Platform.sh will delete Your projects and terminate the Service upon the expiry of the trial period, unless You convert Your trial into a paid subscription.

You can end the free-trial period at Your discretion at any time by removing your Project. Platform.sh also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, or modify the free trial at any time without prior notice. Notwithstanding section Liability, Platform.sh’s liability for any damage of any kind whatsoever arising during any free trial is excluded in entirety, including any obligation or liability with respect to Your Content, except to the extent liability cannot be excluded under applicable law. You assume all risks associated with Your use during a free trial. 

### **10.Suspension**[](#10suspension "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh may immediately suspend Your access to Your Account and/or suspend Your Project(s)(i) in case You or Your User(s) breach the Acceptable Use Policy or applicable law; (ii) in case Your Account shows any overdue invoices, and/or Your payment information is expired and needs to be updated to enable further payments; and/or (iii) as reasonably deemed necessary by Platform.sh to prevent any harm to Platform.sh, to Platform.sh’s customers, to the Services, or the underlying infrastructure. 

Suspended Accounts may have limited functionality in terms of their capability to make any configuration changes. Suspended Projects may have limited functionality including but not limited to: no longer enabling any requests to a running service and responding with errors to any request.

Such suspension will be lifted when the circumstances giving rise to the suspension have been resolved. Suspension does not relieve you from Your payment obligation. 

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section limits the Platform.sh right to immediately and permanently delete Your Project or Account and terminate this Agreement in case of material breach of the Acceptable Use Policy, these Terms of Services or applicable law, or in case You fail to promptly resolve the circumstances giving rise to the suspension as reasonably requested by Platform.sh. 

### **11.Subcontractors**[](#11subcontractors "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh may subcontract obligations under this Agreement, but will remain liable to You for any subcontracted obligation.

### **12.Third-party services**[](#12third-party-services "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh may provide You with access to third-party tools and links that may direct to third-party websites. Platform.sh is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of such third-party tools and websites and does not warrant, and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Such access to third-party links or tools are “as is” and “as available,” without any warranties, representations, or conditions of any kind and without any endorsement. Platform.sh is not liable and shall have no liability whatsoever for any harm or damages related to the purchase or use of goods, services, resources, content, or any other transactions made in connection with any third-party tools or websites relating to Your use of optional third-party tools. These Terms of Service do not apply to any third party links, tools or integrations, and you should consult the terms of service applicable to such links, tools or integrations.

In the case where You or any User consent to a third-party integration, You shall be deemed as agreeing to the passage of data to the third party integration partner for the purposes agreed upon between You and Platform.sh.

The Services may contain features designed to integrate or interoperate with third-party services, tools, or components. Platform.sh will make commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such features. However Platform.sh cannot guarantee the continued availability of such features and may cease to provide them without entitling You to any refund, credit, or other compensation, if for example and without limitation, the provider of a third-party service, tools, or component ceases to make its service, tools, or component available for interoperation with the Services in a manner acceptable to Platform.sh or changes the terms of the third-party services in a manner that no longer allows Platform.sh to provide said integration or interoperability feature. 

### **13.Fees, billing, and payment** [](#13fees-billing-and-payment "Link to this heading")

#### 13.1.Fees[](#131fees "Link to this heading")

The Services can be bundled in plans and options or can be billed on usage basis, as further described on [https://platform.sh/pricing](https://platform.sh/pricing), or on [https://upsun.com/pricing](https://upsun.com/pricing) for the Upsun service.

Platform.sh will provide the Services to You at the rates and for the fees ("**Fees**") displayed on the pricing pages listed above.

All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are non-refundable, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement. 

#### 13.2.Billing and payment[](#132billing-and-payment "Link to this heading")

Bills are issued by Platform.sh at the Organization level and are sent by email to the billing contact registered in Your Account according to the billing schedule of the subscribed Services. 

Our Fees must be paid by credit or debit card. If Your billing currency is Euro, you can elect to pay our Fees by SEPA direct debit. By providing payment card information or signing a SEPA direct-debit mandate, You authorize Platform.sh to charge Your payment card or debit Your account automatically at the billing frequency and in the amount selected by You based on the plan You subscribed to and on your use of the Services. You further authorize Platform.sh to use a third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party. To ensure uninterrupted service and avoid any potential account suspension, you must make sure your payment information is accurate and up to date at all times and maintain sufficient availability under Your credit card limit or sufficient funds in the account linked to Your payment card or SEPA. Failure to provide an accurate and up-to-date billing address may result in unsuccessful payment processing, leading to account suspension until the issue is resolved. 

Platform.sh is not responsible for any (i) payment failure resulting from inaccurate or expired payment card details provided by You, (ii) any restrictions applicable to Your payment card by Your bank, or (iii) misuse, abuse, unauthorized use, or fraudulent use of Your payment cards.

#### 13.3.Delinquent payments and payment disputes[](#133delinquent-payments-and-payment-disputes "Link to this heading")

Delinquent payments, including without limitation those resulting from invalid or expired payment card information, will be subject to interest on overdue amounts at a rate of up to 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower.

If an amount is overdue, Platform.sh may, at its sole discretion (i) suspend access to your Account, (ii) suspend Your Projects, and/or (iii) delete Your Projects and terminate the Agreement.

In the event Platform.sh brings a legal action for collection or hires an agent or authorized representative of collections due to overdue amounts, You will be obligated to pay all related costs of such collection, including but not limited to Platform.sh attorneys’ fees, expenses, court costs, and any other related collection enforcement fees.

Should You wish to dispute a payment, you must promptly, and no later than within 15 days from the payment date, send a written notification of dispute to Platform.sh. You understand and agree that asking Your bank or credit card company to reverse a charge does not relieve you of your obligation to formally and promptly notify Platform.sh of the dispute. You and Platform.sh will collaborate in good faith and without undue delay to resolve said dispute. 

#### 13.4.Taxes[](#134taxes "Link to this heading")

You are responsible for and must pay all Taxes and duties assessed in connection with this Agreement and its performance by any applicable authority, including any sales, use, value-added, withholding, and other Taxes and duties. In the event that Taxes are applicable in respect of this Agreement and its performance, Taxes shall be payable by You in addition to the Fees. For clarification purposes, in the event tax is required by law to be withheld from the Fees, Plaform.sh may gross up the invoice sufficiently such that after the deduction of withholding tax, the original Fees are received by Plaform.sh. In the event that any withholding taxes are paid by You, You shall provide Plaform.sh with a valid withholding tax receipt in Plaform.sh name within thirty (30) days following the payment. Plaform.sh shall provide You with reasonable documentation, such as certificates of residence, required to enable You to apply any reduced rates of withholding tax given by a double tax treaty, if applicable.

For the purpose of complying with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdiction, Platform.sh may ask You to provide accurate and valid tax identification information. You must make sure your tax identification information is always up to date in Your Account, and You understand and agree that You will be liable to pay, or reimburse Platform.sh for, any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any misdeclaration.

For the purpose of this section, “Taxes” means any and all taxes imposed by any taxing authority including, without limitation, income tax on nationals and on foreigners, all corporate taxes, imports, duties, levies, stamp duties, charges, and other assessments and payments in the nature of taxes, wherever payable, including withholding taxes and VAT.

#### 13.5.Changes to prices[](#135changes-to-prices "Link to this heading")

At the sole discretion of Platform.sh, Platform.sh bundle plans and options, as well as prices applicable to Platform.sh and Upsun services and add-ons, may change over time.

You will be notified by email of any price change 30 days prior to the next billing cycle. If You object to the updated prices, as Your sole and exclusive remedy, You can terminate Your subscription.

### **14.Intellectual Property**[](#14intellectual-property "Link to this heading")

#### 14.1.Ownership of the Services[](#141ownership-of-the-services "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh, and where applicable its licensors, are and remain the sole and exclusive owners of all right, title, and interest in and to the Services.

Confidential Information will not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party; (ii) the receiving Party can demonstrate by written evidence that was rightfully in the receiving Party’s possession at the time of disclosure, without an obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving Party without the use of or access to the disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (iv) the receiving Party rightfully obtains from a third party not under a duty of confidentiality and without restriction on use or disclosure.

#### 15.2.Obligations[](#152obligations "Link to this heading")

Each Party will, at all times, both during the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years after its termination, maintain in confidence all Confidential Information of the other Party and will not use such Confidential Information for any purpose, except as otherwise expressly permitted herein. 

Each Party will limit the disclosure of such Confidential Information to those of its Users, employees, agent, legal affiliate, consultants or professional advisors (“**Representatives**”) who need to access such Confidential Information and are subject to binding use and disclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. The receiving Party will be responsible for any or omissions of such Representatives that, if taken by the receiving Party, would constitute a breach of this Agreement. The receiving Party will notify the disclosing Party of any actual or suspected breach of this Confidentiality section.

#### 15.3.Compelled disclosure[](#153compelled-disclosure "Link to this heading")

The receiving Party may make disclosures to the limited extent required by law or court order, provided the receiving Party uses diligent reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and allows the disclosing Party to participate in the proceeding (to the extent legally permitted).

In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this section by either Party, the other Party shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief (in addition to monetary damages and other remedies at law) to enforce the provisions hereof and shall be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees incurred in connection therewith.

Not patching notified vulnerabilities may lead to immediate suspension of Your Projects and Services, at Platform.sh’s sole discretion. For the avoidance of any doubt, Platform.sh will not be responsible for any such vulnerabilities, whether or not identified and notified by Platform.sh. You remain solely responsible for applying security patches and solely liable for the consequences resulting from their failure to apply the security patches needed.

Platform.sh may provide templates and code examples in the Documentation, public repositories, and support interactions.
