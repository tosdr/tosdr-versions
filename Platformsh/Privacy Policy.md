Platform.sh offers different services, products, software, and offerings (the "Services"), including but not limited to, all information, tools and services (including any beta services) available from us to you (the 'User'), that are run under the brand "Platform.sh'' and on related Platform.sh websites, including but not limited to: [https://platform.sh](https://platform.sh/), [https://docs.platform.sh](https://docs.platform.sh/), [https://status.platform.sh](https://status.platform.sh/), [https://accounts.platform.sh](https://accounts.platform.sh/?), [https://console.platform.sh/,](https://console.platform.sh/,) [https://blackfire.io](https://blackfire.io/), and [Upsun.com](https://upsun.com/) (the 'Sites'), conditioned upon your acceptance of all terms, conditions, policies and notices stated in the Terms of Services and this Privacy Policy.

(**Note:** this Privacy Policy explicitly excludes customer sites. These sites are subdomains under .platform.sh and .platformsh.site).

This Privacy Policy explains how Platform.sh collects, uses, stores, and shares your personal information when you use our Services and/or visit our Sites in accordance with various privacy laws. By using the Sites and Services, Users and visitors acknowledge the processing of their personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy which may be modified or updated from time to time. Personal data is information that alone or in combination with other information in our possession, or likely to come into our possession, can be used to identify a living individual. We strive to make this Privacy Policy as consumer-friendly as possible, but if you have a question about something, please contact us.

#### **(2) Information we collect**[](#2-information-we-collect "Link to this heading")

We collect information that you give us or that we get from your use of our Sites and Services, including without limitation, the following categories:

* names;
* addresses;
* country;
* email addresses;
* telephone numbers;
* organizations; 
* job title;
* financial data relating to orders;
* IP Addresses; 
* log files; 
* CV and and other information when applying to work with us through our [Careers page](https://platform.sh/company/careers/); and
* We may also collect information about you, including your user interactions with our Sites and Services, from cookies and tracking devices if you have consented to their use.

Platform.sh provides tools to make your development workflow more productive, such as our command-line interface (CLI). Also, Platform.sh will occasionally provide application-specific modules or libraries, which you may opt into, for integration into your software project in order to make its configuration simpler. Such applications, libraries, or modules may report usage information to us, which we may collect. Information collected may contain the type of actions performed, log data of API activity, as well as configuration information. This information may be linked to you, and we may use this information to better provide technical support to you and to improve our Services. We do not explicitly collect any special categories of personal data or sensitive personal information through our Sites and Services. However, we may collect special categories of personal data or sensitive personal information if you have signed up to attend a conference hosted by Platform.sh and have explicitly consented to the processing of your data regarding dietary restrictions or disability accommodations.

#### **(3) Our use of cookies and urchin tracking modules (UTMs)**[](#3-our-use-of-cookies-and-urchin-tracking-modules-utms "Link to this heading")

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or mobile device). Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a site upon a future visit. When used, cookies are downloaded and stored on your device. Such information, on its own, will not identify you personally. It is statistical data. You have the option to accept all cookies, accept some cookies while rejecting others, or reject them all. Rejecting functional cookies may prevent you from using certain portions or functionalities of our sites and Services. We may use such cookies to deliver and improve our Services. Some third-party services that we use to improve the Services (including usage, measuring performance, and advertising), such as Google Analytics, may also place cookies on your device. Examples of Cookies we use:

* **Strictly necessary cookies**. These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
* **Performance & analytic cookies**. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Sites.
* **Functional cookies**. These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization.
* **Advertising cookies**. These cookies deliver and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and may be set through our site by our advertising partners.
* **Social media cookies**. These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks.

The validity period of cookies for our sites and Services is 6 months. We will request a new prior consent after this period.

[Urchin Tracking Module ("UTM")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters) tags are distinct from cookies as defined above. UTM works as a custom Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) parameter for marketing campaigns and reports can be viewed in platforms like Google Analytics. UTM tags are appended as part of the visible URL in marketing programs to understand the specific instance of a link. UTM tag reports are observed in Google Analytics or Marketo to better understand how our visitors are getting to our websites, and as such, who our visitors are. Such data is collected at an aggregate level, and we will not identify you personally. Customizing the URL with UTM tags allows us to better understand marketing activity, which then allows us to better serve our customers and audience.

As part of this process, non-identifying and non-profiling information (source, medium, campaign, and [Click ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9744275?hl=en#:~:text=CenterCommunityAnnouncements-,Google%20Click%20Identifier%20(GCLID):%20Definition,on%20the%20auto-tagging%20setting.)), will be stored in your browser in local storage. No Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) or personal data will be stored. This information would only be used by Platform.sh if you sign up for and consent to our service. At that point in time, campaign attribution information would be made available to Platform.sh to gauge the effectiveness of the campaign. You may clear your browser cache prior to signing up for our service to opt out.

You can manage your cookies preference in our Cookies dashboard. For any questions on cookies or UTM opt-outs, or about our policy listed here, please [contact us](https://platform.sh/contact/).

#### **(4) How we use your information**[](#4-how-we-use-your-information "Link to this heading")

**Our affiliates and subsidiaries**: To provide the Services and for any of the purposes identified above.

**Third-party service providers**: We use trusted third-party service providers, consultants, and other agents to help us provide, maintain, protect, and improve our Services and Sites.

**Legal**: We will share personal information with our regulators, law enforcement, or fraud prevention agencies, as well as legal advisers, and courts, if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

* comply with legal obligations, meet applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes, or abide by enforceable governmental requests (however, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice to Platform.sh’s customers when we receive a request for customer personal data unless Platform.sh is explicitly prohibited from doing so by applicable laws);

**Your rights under GDPR:**

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have certain data protection and privacy rights. In certain circumstances, you have the following privacy rights:

**Your rights under Canada’s PIPEDA (Privacy rights):**

The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (‘PIPEDA’) is the Canadian federal privacy law that regulates how private-sector organizations handle personal information in the course of commercial activity.

Platform.sh continuously strives to comply with [PIPEDA Principles](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/p_principle/). We have procedures in place to receive and respond to any complaints and inquiries you may have. Contact us or email our Data Protection Officer at dpo@platform.sh. For existing customers, please file a support ticket.  If you are a resident of Canada you have certain privacy rights:

The right to know why your personal information is being collected, how it will be used, and to whom it will be disclosed. This Privacy Policy serves this purpose.  You also have the right to access, or correct, your personal information.

**Your rights under California privacy laws.**

The California Consumer Privacy Act (‘CCPA’) and the California Privacy Rights Act (‘CPRA’), (together ‘**California Privacy Laws**’), give California consumers/residents (or your authorized agent) certain privacy rights and impose corresponding, and independent, obligations on businesses processing California consumers’ personal information. 

Platform.sh does **NOT** sell your personal information. We do **NOT** collect sensitive personal information as defined under California Privacy Laws. Where applicable, we have added contractual requirements instructing our service providers to not further collect, sell, share, or use the consumers’ personal information except as necessary to perform their respective business purpose. If you are a resident of California you have certain privacy rights:

* **Right to know**. You have the right to know about the personal information we  collect about you and how it is used and shared. This Privacy Policy serves this purpose.
* **Right to delete.** You have the right to  request us to  delete your personal information and to tell our  service providers to do the same. However, there are many exceptions that allow businesses to keep your personal information. Please note that this is not an absolute right and we might need to retain your personal information for compliance with laws or other legitimate reasons.
* **Right to correct.** You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information about you.
* **Right to portability.** You have the right to receive your personal information  in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format. 
* **Right to opt-out of sale or sharing.** Platform.sh does not sell or share your personal information within the meaning of California Privacy Laws.
* **Right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of your rights**. We do not use financial incentive practices that are unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious, and do not retaliate against those who choose to exercise their rights.
* **Right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive PI**. You have the right to direct that we limit the use of sensitive PI to the use that is reasonably necessary to perform the services expected by you. We do not collect sensitive personal information as defined under the CCPA.
* **Right to opt-in for children:** Business Obligation Not to Sell or Share Children’s PI unless there is Affirmative Authorization. We do not sell or share personal information as defined under the CCPA nor do we (knowingly) collect  children's personal information.

#### **(8) Accessing and updating your personal information**[](#8-accessing-and-updating-your-personal-information "Link to this heading")

Whenever made possible on your account settings, you can access, update, or request deletion of your personal information and data we held about you directly within your account settings section. Please also file a support ticket to confirm any account changes, or contact us to assist you. If you are unable to perform these actions yourself (e.g. you don’t have an account), please contact us using the various methods detailed below to assist you.  For customers located in Australia, you may also email "dpo@platform.sh".

#### **(9) Storing, securing, and transfer of your personal data and information**[](#9-storing-securing-and-transfer-of-your-personal-data-and-information "Link to this heading")

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and do not collect more personal information than what is necessary for those purposes. We also ensure that the information we collect is accurate and sufficient to properly fulfill those purposes. We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your personal information to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We retain usage data for a reasonable period of time to pursue legitimate business interests, or for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for up to 14 months or less, except when this data requires a longer retention period due to a compliance reason, legal obligation, security purpose, or legitimate business reason that does not outweigh the user's or visitor's interests, such as improving the Services.

We take all reasonable measures to protect your personal data and information from unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, information we maintain. To maintain your trust, we’ve achieved several independently audited industry certifications, ensuring your data is handled with appropriate care and according to industry standards. You can find more information [here](https://platform.sh/trust-center/). We also  use physical, organizational, and technological methods and policies to protect and safeguard your personal information. For more on our security, please visit [https://platform.sh/trust-center/](https://platform.sh/trust-center/).

We may transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries with and without an EU adequacy decision to enable customers to rapidly deploy projects in any geographical region. Customer name, email, and ssh keys may be transferred from the Platform.sh Accounts portal located in Ireland to clusters in France, Ireland, USA, Australia, Canada, the UK, and Germany using securely encrypted transfer channels (TLS) and encrypted at rest. We transfer this data to companies that are GDPR compliant. Platform.sh signs Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with all processors, and has replaced vendors who fail security, compliance, or privacy assessments. We also conduct Supplementary Measures Assessments on vendors who store personal data in non-adequate countries.

#### **(10) Data breaches**[](#10-data-breaches "Link to this heading")

We will report any unlawful data breaches to any and all relevant persons and authorities within 72 hours (or sooner if it is required under applicable privacy laws) of the breach when such breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Platform’s obligation to report or respond to a personal data breach or security incident will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Platform.sh of any fault or liability with respect to the personal data breach or security incident. Should you have any complaint about a breach, or the way in which we will handle a breach, please contact us.

#### **(11) Third-party links**[](#11-third-party-links "Link to this heading")

Our Services may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We do not endorse these sites, nor are we responsible for the content or accuracy of any information contained on them. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policies of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

#### **(12) Children’s privacy**[](#12-childrens-privacy "Link to this heading")

To the extent prohibited by applicable law, our Service does not address anyone under the age of 16 (“**Children**”). By agreeing to our Terms of Service, you represent that you are the age of majority in your state, province, or country of residence, or 16 years of age, whichever is greater. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verifiable verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information from our databases and servers.

#### **(13) About us**[](#13-about-us "Link to this heading")

Platform.sh has a designated Data Protection Officer who is accountable for the management of your personal information, including collection, usage, disclosure, retention, and transfer of personal information to third parties for processing. All privacy issues, compliance requests, inquiries, and other requests will be handled by our French parent company, Platform.sh SAS.
