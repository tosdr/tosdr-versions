**GROUP HELP BOT**
==================

Privacy Policy

At Group Help, accessible from [@GroupHelpBot](https://t.me/GroupHelpBot) on Telegram and all others Bots connected to it, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users.  
This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Group Help.  
  
If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us with Support button in the Bot or through our email.  
  
This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for users who come into contact to our Telegram Bots with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in Group Help or that Telegram shares with Group Help related to them. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than these Telegram Bots.

**Lawful bases**
----------------

We **do not ask** for your prior consent in relation to the data that is saved as the following **information is essential** to be able to provide the services to the groups that use our Bot.  
  
The lawful bases we rely on for processing your information are:

* We offer a public service for the protection of Telegram groups.
    * Telegram does not offer any feature to automatically protect groups, which is why our bot acts in the public interest in this regard, offering a mostly free service for protecting groups from any unwelcome external and internal attacks.
    * The manual group management functions provided directly by Telegram are incomplete or hard to be used: through our bot it is possible to greatly facilitate the action of administrators to protect their groups, compensating for the shortcomings of the platform itself.
* We pursue the legitimate interest of groups and their group managers, who use our services also for 360-degree management of the same.

This doesn't affect your rights, which are explained in detail later in this document.

**Detailed information on the data we collect and save**
--------------------------------------------------------

To provide our services we need to collect some information which are detailed here.  
For each type of data collected it is specified how we collect them, why we collect them, who has access to them, how long we keep them and eventually if it's not possible to request their cancellation (only for data absolutely necessary for the public service offered by the bot).

1. We save your account information like: Telegram ID, name, surname, username, bio, language and the date of the last update of this data in our database.
    
    * These are sent us by Telegram API when you join a group with our bot or send something in a group with our bot or start privately one of our bots or when someone uses a bot command by specifying your username as a parameter.
    * Some of this information (in particular the bio) is not necessarily always saved.
    * These are saved as long as your account exists on Telegram (and up to 20 years after its eventual cancellation).
    * These are saved to make bot commands via id/username (like /ban, /mute, /info, etc.) to work properly.
    * All Telegram users can retrive this information (with /info command) having your Telegram ID or your username, with bot commands. This information is publicly visible in your Telegram profile.
2. We save in which groups your Telegram account was detected, which is your status in the group (member, restricted, banned and/or left), how many messages you have sent there, the date of the last detected message and the date of joining.
    
    * These are sent us by Telegram API when you join a group with our bot or send something in a group with our bot.
    * These are saved as long as your account exists on Telegram (and up to 20 years after its eventual cancellation).
    * These are saved to make bot some commands (like /list, /inactives and /info) to work properly.
    * These can be retrieved by the staff of a group (with bot commands or a log channel), but only for your information about that group itself.
3. We save in which groups you are owner or administrator, which permissions you've exactly there and eventually your custom title.
    
    * These are obtained through Telegram API if you are the owner of the group or if you are promoted as group administrator.
    * These are saved as long as you are administrator/owner in the group (and until the list we save is updated, usually within 2 days if the group is active).
    * These are saved to give you the possibility in the group to use the commands you have been given access to and possibly to manage the bot through the private chat.
    * If you aren't set as anonymous administrator/owner, all users in a specific group may see that you are administrator/owner of the group itself (with /staff command and also with Telegram functions).
    * You cannot request the deletion of this data as it is necessary to offer our public service. If you want to delete this data, leave the groups in which you are administrator/owner and our bot is present.

    * These are saved when a group manager change your roles within the group.
    * These are saved as long as you've the role in the group and your account exists on Telegram (and up to 20 years after its eventual cancellation).
    * These are saved to allow you to take advantage of the permissions provided to the roles you have within the group and eventually to show them in /staff command.
    * These can be retrieved by the staff of a group (with bot commands or a log channel), but only for your information about that group itself. If you have roles which appear in /staff command, all users in the group may see them.
