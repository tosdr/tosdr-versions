Last updated: Oct 25, 2023

### Welcome to Poe!

These Poe Terms of Service (“Terms”) are an agreement entered between you and Quora, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Quora,” “we,” or “us”) in connection with your use of the Poe service (“Poe”). In these Terms, "you" refers both to you as an individual and to the entity you represent. By using Poe, you consent to these Poe Terms of Service.

Quora’s [Quora Platform Terms of Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos) also apply to your use of Poe. In the event of a conflict between the [Quora Platform Terms of Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos) and the Poe Terms of Service, the Poe Terms of Service will apply. If you purchase a subscription to Poe, then the [Subscriber Terms](https://poe.com/subscriber_tos) shall apply as well. Poe is considered part of the “Quora Platform” for purposes of the [Quora Platform Terms of Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos). Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Poe Terms of Service have the meanings defined in the [Quora Platform Terms](https://www.quora.com/about/tos) of Service.

IMPORTANT ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU ARE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND QUORA WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

### **1\. A Platform for Open Exploration (Poe).**

Poe is a platform that enables you to explore and interact with various bots powered by third-party Large Language Models (“LLMs”) and developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic. Poe may also allow you to create your own bots powered by these third-party LLMs. You can use Bots for a variety of purposes, from learning, writing help, translation, programming help, summarization, entertainment, to many other things. Each bot has its own description in its profile and the name of the company, developer, or individual who created the bot. Usage guidelines for all bots can be found by visiting [https://poe.com/usage\_guidelines](https://poe.com/usage_guidelines) or in your settings. Poe is a platform that enables users to access various third-party bots, but Poe does not provide and is not not responsible for the content or services available from these bots.
