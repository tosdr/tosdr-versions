**1\. A Platform for Open Exploration (Poe).**

Poe is a platform that enables you to explore and interact with various bots powered by third-party Large Language Models (“LLMs”) and developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic. Poe may also allow you to create your own bots powered by these third-party LLMs. You can use Bots for a variety of purposes, from learning, writing help, translation, programming help, summarization, entertainment, to many other things. Each bot has its own description in its profile and the name of the company, developer, or individual who created the bot. Usage guidelines for all bots can be found by visiting [https://poe.com/usage\_guidelines](https://poe.com/usage_guidelines) or in your settings. Poe is a platform that enables users to access various third-party bots, but Poe does not provide and is not not responsible for the content or services available from these bots.
