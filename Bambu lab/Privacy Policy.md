Below we provide some of the categories of our retention periods:

* **Data Retained until You Remove It.** It's your right to request that we delete certain of your personal data. See Section Erasure in Chapter 4 (Your Privacy Rights for more information).
* **Data that Expires after a Specific Period of Time.** We have set certain retention periods so that some data expires or will be deleted after a specific period of time.
* **Data Retained until Your Bambu Account is Deleted.** We keep some data until your Bambu Lab account is deleted. When your Bambu Lab account is deleted, your data will be deleted or be anonymized.
* **Data Retained for Extended Time Periods for Limited Purposes.** After your account is deleted, we may keep some data for a longer time period but for very limited purposes, such as fulfilling legal obligation.

**7\. Transfer to Other Countries**
===================================

Due to the global nature of our business, Bambu Lab shares personal data internationally with Bambu Lab affiliated companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the data processing activities described in this Policy.

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we will make sure that the data transfer complies with applicable law. We also ensure the personal data benefits from an adequate level of data protection when transferring your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland by relying on:

* Adequacy Decisions. This applies when we transfer personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("**EEA**") which have adequate laws to protect personal data, as determined by the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws). 
* Standard Contractual Clauses ("**SCCs**"). The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA to countries without an adequacy decision. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called SCCs. For example, we use SCCs to transfer the personal data described in Chapter 2 (Personal Data We Collect) to our data hosting provider located in the US. You can exercise your rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us at privacy@bambulab.com.
* For a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in Chapter 11 (Our Contact Information) below.

**8.Data Security**
===================

We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We, with our best efforts, use certain physical, organizational, and technical security measures that are designed to improve the integrity and security of personal data that we collect and maintain. We use cryptographic technologies to ensure the confidentiality of data transmission and storage, and implement reliable protection mechanisms to protect data from attacks. We deploy access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized to your personal data. In addition, we limit the number of authorised personnel and implement hierarchical permission management based on service requirements and personnel levels. Access to personal data will be logged and reviewed by authorised personnel on a regular basis. (You can find more information about our security measures at [https://wiki.bambulab.com/general/bbl-security](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/general/bbl-security)).

However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no system is ever completely secure thus we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal data will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or organizational security measures.

If other individuals have access to your Bambu Account, then they may access your personal data, controls and the service available in your account. For example, you may allow someone to use your account on a shared device. It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing your personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Bambu Account may impact your personalized settings and be included in your data records. To protect your user account and privacy, we encourage you to:

use a strong password which you only use for your Bambu Account;

never share your password with anyone else;

limit access to your own computer and browser; and

log out each time you finish using the Bambu Lab Products and Service in a shared or public environment.
