End-User License Agreement
==========================

By installing or using the software (the "product"), the individual or entity licensing the product ("licensee") is consenting to be bound by and is becoming a party to this license agreement ("agreement"). If licensee does not agree to all of the terms of this agreement, licensee must not install or use the product. This agreement is a legal license agreement between licensee and legal owner of Vovsoft.com ("Vovsoft").

The product is distributed "as is" and without any warranty as to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or any other warranties either expressed or implied. Vovsoft will not be liable for data loss, damages, loss of profits or any other kind of loss while using or misusing this software. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Vovsoft or its suppliers or resellers be liable for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the product, including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is based.

In any case, Vovsoft's entire liability under any provision of this agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the fees licensee paid for this license (if any). Vovsoft is not responsible for any liability arising out of content provided by licensee or a third party that is accessed through the product and/or any material linked through such content.

The product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit ([http://www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org/)). The product includes cryptographic software written by Eric Young ([\[email protected\]](https://vovsoft.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)). Please remember that export/import and/or use of cryptography software, providing cryptography hooks or even just communicating technical details about cryptography software is illegal in some parts of the world. Vovsoft and the authors of OpenSSL are not liable for any violations you make. By downloading, installing or using any portion of the product, you agree that the product meet your local and state cryptography laws, rules and regulations.

The product uses libraries from the [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) project under the LGPLv3.

The product supports silent installation, i.e. the application can be installed without displaying the installation windows and without showing prompts. This is a useful thing if you want to automate installation.

You may copy the product and documentation as you wish, and give exact copies of the original product to anyone, and distribute the product and documentation in its unmodified form via electronic means. But you should not charge or request donations for any such copies however made, or from distributing the product and/or documentation with other software without the author's written permission. Any attempts at reverse-engineering or thwarting the license protection scheme of the product is prohibited. Any evidence of tampering will be investigated and may lead to prosecution according to all applicable laws.

One licensed copy of the product may either be used by a single person who uses the software personally on one or more computers, or installed on a single workstation used non-simultaneously by multiple people, but not both. You may access the licensed edition of the product through a network, provided that you have obtained individual licenses for the software covering all workstations that will access the software through the network. Upon purchase, you should receive a license key which is necessary to enable the software. A license entitles the holder to use the program. This code must be kept in the strictest confidence and must not be given or revealed to anyone but the licensed owner. Failure to abide by these provisions may result in severe legal penalties and will result in revocation of the license which will cause the program to no longer work.

Without prejudice to any other rights, Vovsoft may terminate this agreement if licensee breaches any of its terms and conditions. Upon termination, licensee shall destroy all copies of the product.
