Last updated August 04 2021

AppsFlyer Ltd. ("AppsFlyer", "we", "our" or "us") uses technologies such as cookies, beacons, pixels, E-tags, and scripts (collectively, “Cookies”). These technologies are used in order to provide, maintain, and improve our websites (the “Sites”), to optimize our offerings and marketing activities, and to provide our visitors and users (“you”, or “your”) with a better experience, for example, in order to maintain your preferences, to better secure our Sites, to identify technical issues, and to monitor and improve the overall performance of our Sites.

If you’re unable to find what you were looking for on this page regarding Cookies, or if you have any further questions, please contact privacy@appsflyer.com.

* ##### What are Cookies
    
    A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a browser. The browser provides this piece of text to the originating server when the visitor returns, so that we can respond accordingly when you return to our Sites. Such cookies may be either “first party cookies” (set by us) or “third party cookies” (set by third-party providers who work with us ).
* ##### USE OF COOKIES
    
    On our Sites (to which the [Website Privacy Policy](https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/privacy-policy/) applies) we use the following types of Cookies:
    
    1. Strictly Necessary Cookies: Necessary Cookies are enabled for the assurance and function of a properly run website, and they cannot be disabled. They are usually only set in response to actions permitted by you, such as, enabling functions like navigation and access to secure areas of the website. These Cookies do not store personal information that will be used for other purposes
    2. Performance Cookies: These Cookies provide us with aggregated (anonymous) insights into website enhancement and performance improvement. These cookies allow us to measure and improve the performance of our Sites. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the website.
    3. Functional Cookies: These Cookies enable us to provide enhanced functionality and personalization through our Sites and allow for a better user experience. These may be set by us (first-party Cookies) or by third-party providers who work with us (third-party Cookies).

AppsFlyer, or our advertising partners may use them to show you relevant ads on different websites by uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. Should you opt-out, you will experience less targeted advertising.

A “Session Cookie” is automatically deleted upon the completion of your session with us and you exit the browser, whilst a “Persistent Cookie” is used for example to store your login information and therefore will remain on your device until you delete it or it expires.
