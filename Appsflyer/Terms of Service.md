AppsFlyer shall not apply such late interest, terminate the Agreement, or suspend provision of the Services if Customer has notified AppsFlyer prior to the due date that it believes the invoice is incorrect, has a reasonable good faith basis for such determination and cooperates with AppsFlyer in good faith to resolve the issue. If the parties do not resolve such issue amicably within 30 (thirty) days following the receipt of the notice from Customer, AppsFlyer shall have the right to exercise any of its abovementioned rights.
        
    4. **Taxes**. Unless expressly stated otherwise under an Order Form, all fees are exclusive of any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, with holding, VAT or other similar taxes or duties, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, shall be borne and paid by Customer (except for any taxes based on AppsFlyer’s net income).
        
* ##### Customer Data and Privacy.
    
    1. **Restricted Data**. AppsFlyer strictly prohibits using the Services or any Developer Tools to collect, store, upload, process or transmit to AppsFlyer, or through the Services to any third party, any Restricted Data. Customer shall not configure the Services or Developer Tools to enable the collection, transmission, or storage of Restricted Data on or through the Services.
    2. **Children**. Customer shall configure the Developer Tools and Services appropriately to ensure compliance with applicable Children data protection and privacy laws and any platform policies or third party agreements with Integrated Partners that Customer is subject to. Without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall configure the Services to ensure that End User Data from Children is not transmitted to any Integrated Partner except where both the Integrated Partner’s service is specifically tailored to support and process End User Data from Children and the Integrated Partner permits Customer to transmit such End User Data related to Children to such Integrated Partner. For more information, Customer should review and implement the appropriate controls as provided in the AppsFlyer  [Kids App Implementation Guide](https://www.appsflyer.com/gatedpdfs/KidsAppsComplianceGuide_03_22.pdf).   
    3. **AppsFlyer Responsibilities.** AppsFlyer shall process Customer Data in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations pursuant to the terms set forth in the Agreement including, to the extent any such Customer Data contains Personal Data, the  [DPA](https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/dpa/). AppsFlyer shall implement and use appropriate physical, technical, administrative, and organizational measures that are designed to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the Customer Data, as further specified in our  [Security Measure Commitments](https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/security-measure-commitments/).
    4. **Customer Responsibilities.** Customer shall: (i) collect, use and process Customer Data in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations; (ii) provide appropriate notice to End Users that clearly and accurately discloses its privacy practices, including with respect to its use of services such as the Services; and (iii) ensure it has or obtains all necessary rights, lawful basis, and, where required by law, consents (including parental consent in the case of any End User Data related to Children) to: (a) collect and use the End User Data; (b) enable the processing of End User Data by AppsFlyer as per the terms of the Agreement; (c) place any cookies or similar technologies (including by AppsFlyer) on End Users’ browsers or mobile devices; and (d) configure the Services and Developer Tools in such a manner that ensures compliance with any platform policies and terms (e.g. Apple and Google Store) applicable to Customer.
    5. **Personal Data.** To the extent any End User Data is deemed Personal Data as such term is defined under the  [DPA](https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/dpa/), the terms and conditions set forth in the  [DPA](https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/dpa/) shall apply to the use and processing of such Personal Data and shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
    6. **Remedy**. Without limiting any remedies available to AppsFlyer under this Agreement or applicable law, AppsFlyer reserves the right to cease or suspend performance of the Services if it reasonably deems that Customer has not fulfilled any of its obligations under Section 9 and any of its sub-sections.
* ##### Integrated Partners.
    
    The Services enable Customer to connect and/or integrate with Integrated Partners in order to facilitate the upload, storage and sending of certain data (e.g. data or content related to Customer’s marketing campaigns, conversion results, creatives, End User Data, events) between Customer and its Integrated Partners (**“Campaign and Analytics Data”**). Customer acknowledges and agrees: (i) that once the Services are configured by Customer to connect to an Integrated Partner, Customer Campaign and Analytics Data will be sent to the Integrated Partner and/or received from the Integrated Partner, unless otherwise configured by Customer in accordance with the Documentation; (ii) to only send Integrated Partners such Campaign and Analytics Data (including End User Data) that the Integrated Partner permits pursuant to any terms or agreements between Integrated Partner and Customer; (iii) the sending of any Campaign and Analytics Data (or any specific data parameter) shall be enabled only to the extent supported by the Integrated Partner and AppsFlyer; (iv) any use of the Campaign and Analytics Data by an Integrated Partner shall be subject to Customer’s own agreements with Integrated Partner and AppsFlyer is not responsible for Integrated Partner’s use of the Campaign and Analytics Data; and (v) any use or processing of Campaign and Analytics Data received from an Integrated Partner for processing by the Services may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by Integrated Partners on AppsFlyer directly, including, without limitation, requirements by Integrated Partners to delete such data after a certain period of time or disclosing to Customers only certain Campaign and Analytics Data parameters or in a specific form (e.g. in aggregated form only). Pursuant to the foregoing, Customer hereby instructs AppsFlyer to: (i) send Campaign and Analytics Data to Integrated Partners in accordance with Customer’s configurations of the Service; (ii) and to process Campaign and Analytics Data from Integrated Partners in order to perform the Services.
* ##### Confidentiality
    
    1. **Definition**. During the Term, each party may disclose to the other party Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include information that Receiving Party can show: (a) was already lawfully known to, or independently developed by, Receiving Party without access to, or use of, Confidential Information, (b) was received by Receiving Party from any third party without restrictions, (c) is publicly and generally available, free of confidentiality and non-use restrictions; (d) is required to be disclosed in order to provide the Services, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or (e) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation or is requested in the context of a law enforcement investigation, provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Receiving Party provides the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such requirement and reasonably cooperates with Disclosing Party to obtain an order protecting the information from disclosure and discloses only such minimal portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed. In addition, the terms of this Agreement may not be disclosed by either party, without the other party's prior written consent, except during due diligence in the course of a merger, acquisition, investment or sale of all or substantially all of a party’s shares or assets.
    2. **Duty of Care.** The parties agree to hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to disclose such Confidential Information to third parties other than Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants or subcontractors of a party who have a need to know in connection with this Agreement or to use such Confidential Information for any purposes whatsoever other than the performance of this Agreement.  The parties agree to advise and obtain undertakings from their respective Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants and subcontractors of their obligations to keep all Confidential Information confidential and each party shall remain liable for any breach of confidentiality and non-use obligations by any of the foregoing. Each party agrees to treat the Confidential Information it receives with the same degree of care as it treats its own Confidential Information and in any event, with no less than a reasonable degree of care. As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information.
    3. **Remedies**. Each party acknowledges that breach of its obligation of confidentiality may give rise to irreparable injury to the other party, which damage may be inadequately compensable in the form of monetary damages.  Accordingly, a party may seek and obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of the foregoing undertakings.
    4. **Return of Data.** Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, each party shall, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of termination, return or destroy all Confidential Information received from the other party, or created or received by a party on behalf of the other party, which are in such party’s possession. The non-disclosure and non-use obligations set forth in this Section 11 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of 5 (five) years except that any trade secrets (including, but not limited to source codes, technology, algorithms, and protocols) shall be deemed and treated as Confidential Information for as long as such information continues to be protectable as trade secret information under applicable laws.
* ##### Intellectual Property.
    
    1. **Customer Property.** Customer shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Properties. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to provide AppsFlyer any rights in the Customer Properties except the limited rights explicitly set forth herein. Customer hereby grants AppsFlyer a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to upload, store, display, publish, publicly perform, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, transfer, make available, and otherwise access and process the Customer Data solely for and to the extent required to provide, support, and maintain the Services. Without derogating from the foregoing, AppsFlyer confirms that it shall not make any changes, alterations, edits, or modifications to the Customer Content itself without the prior written consent of Customer.
    2. **AppsFlyer Property**. As between the parties, AppsFlyer shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the AppsFlyer Properties. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to provide Customer any rights in the AppsFlyer Properties except the limited rights explicitly set forth herein.
    3. **Feedback and Aggregated and De-Identified Data**. If Customer provides AppsFlyer with any Feedback, then, Customer hereby grants AppsFlyer and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, distribute, disclose, and incorporate into its Services such Feedback. Customer acknowledges and agrees that AppsFlyer may use all such Feedback without restriction. Additionally, Customer acknowledges and agrees that AppsFlyer may use Aggregated and De-Identified Data to improve the service, perform market research and benchmarking.
* ##### Warranties.
    
    1. **Mutual Warranties**. Each party represents and warrants that: (a) it is duly organized under applicable law and has sufficient authority to enter into this Agreement; (b) the person entering into this Agreement is authorized to sign this Agreement on behalf of such party; (c) the execution and performance under this Agreement does not conflict with any contractual obligations such party has to any third party; (d) it will not knowingly introduce into the other party’s systems any worms, viruses, spyware, adware or other malicious or intrusive software; and (e) it shall comply with all applicable federal, state, local, or other laws and regulations applicable to its obligations under this Agreement.
        
    2. **Customer Warranties**. The Customer represents and warrants that: (i) the Customer Properties do not, to the best of its knowledge, infringe the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of any third party; (ii) it owns, or has all appropriate rights and/or licenses to, the Applications; and (iii) it has all permissions, authority, licenses, and consents required to enable the Services to access, download and/or upload Customer Data to Customer’s Account for the purpose of providing the Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
        
    3. **AppsFlyer Warranties**. AppsFlyer warrants that the Services shall conform to, and operate in all material respects in accordance with, the Documentation and such other descriptions and materials as are attached, described and/or provided under this Agreement. For any breach of this warranty, Customer’s exclusive remedy shall be to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 16(b) below.
        
    4. **Disclaimer of Warranties**.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. CUSTOMER ACCEPTS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE DEVELOPER TOOLS, SERVICES, AND REPORTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN. APPSFLYER FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES, DEVELOPER TOOLS OR REPORTS WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S NEEDS, BE ERROR FREE, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. IN ADDITION, THE SERVICES, DEVELOPER TOOLS, AND REPORTS PROVIDED UNDER A FREE SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGE, FREE TRIAL OR BETA SERVICES ARE EXCLUSIVE OF ANY WARRANTY AND REPRESENTATIONS WHATSOEVER. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR THE SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT THAT APPSFLYER CANNOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY SHALL BE THE MINIMUM REQUIRED UNDER SUCH LAW.
        
* ##### Indemnification.
    
    1. **AppsFlyer Indemnification**. AppsFlyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Customer (and its Affiliates, officers, directors and employees) from and against any and all direct damages, costs, losses, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable court costs and reasonable attorneys’ legal fees) which Customer may suffer or incur in connection with any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any third party arising from the Developer Tools and/or Services infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party. If the Services are the subject of an infringement claim, or AppsFlyer reasonably believes that the Services shall be the subject of an infringement claim, AppsFlyer may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if modification of the Services to be non-infringing is not reasonably practical (in which case Customer shall be entitled to a pro-rated refund of any prepaid fees). This Section 14(a) sets forth AppsFlyer’s sole obligations and Customer’s sole remedies for any claim that the Developer Tools and/or Services infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AppsFlyer shall have no responsibility or liability for any claim to the extent resulting from or arising out of Customer’s: (a) use or modification of the Developer Tools or Services not in compliance with this Agreement, the Documentation or applicable law; (b) combination of the Developer Tools or Services with any code, platform or services not provided or authorized by AppsFlyer; or (c) if AppsFlyer has provided notice of a requirement to update any script, SDK, API, or other code provided as part of the Developer Tools, Customer continues to  use  such parts of the Developer Tools that are not the most up-to-date.
        
    2. **Customer Indemnification**. Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless AppsFlyer (and its Affiliates, officers, directors and employees) from and against any and all direct damages, costs, losses, liabilities or expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ legal fees) which AppsFlyer may suffer or incur in connection with any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any third party arising from: (a)  Customer’s breach of its representation and warranties hereunder; (b) breach of Customer’s obligations under Section 9 (Customer Data and Privacy) of this MSA; and/or (c) a breach by Customer of Section 10(ii) of this MSA (Integrated Partners).
        
    3. **Procedure**. In the event of a claim that falls under the Indemnification obligations of either party, as abovementioned, the indemnified party shall: (i) provide the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that the indemnified party’s failure to notify the indemnifying party will not diminish the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Section 14, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure); (ii) cooperate fully with the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s expense); and (iii) allow the indemnifying party to control the defense (except where unreasonable) and settlement of such claim, provided that no settlement may be entered into without the consent of the indemnified party if such settlement would require any or admission of liability or action on the part of the indemnified party other than to cease using any allegedly infringing or illegal content or services. An indemnified party will, at all times, have the option to participate in any matter or litigation through counsel of its own selection at its own expense.
        
* ##### Liability.
    
    1. **Exclusions**. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY NOR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AFFILIATES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR GOODWILL ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THE SERVICES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ARRANGEMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF, OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN, SUCH DAMAGES. 
        
    2. **Limitations of Liability.** IN ANY EVENT, EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED TO, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO APPSFLYER IN THE 12 (TWELVE) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.  THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF ONE PARTY TO THE OTHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING LIABILITY RESULTING FROM A BREACH OF AGREEMENT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, BUT IN NO WAY SHALL LIMIT CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH UNDER THIS SECTION 15(b) SHALL NOT APPLY TO EACH PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS AND TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, APPSFLYER SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR THE SERVICES AND THE DEVELOPER TOOLS PROVIDED UNDER A FREE SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGE, FREE TRIAL OR BETA SERVICES, UNLESS SUCH EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW IN WHICH CASE APPSFLYER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED $1,000.00.

    3. **Termination for Liquidation**. Either party may terminate the Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party: (i) voluntarily or involuntarily becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or of any proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or composition for the benefit of creditors that is not dismissed or discharged within sixty (60) days after being commenced; (ii) admits in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or takes any corporate action tantamount to such admission; (iii) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (iv) ceases to do business as a going concern.

Any obligations of the parties that by their nature are intended to survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, including the obligations of the parties in Sections 1, 2(f), 7-10, 11-15, 16(d), and 17-21 of this Agreement, shall survive any termination or expiration thereof.

    5. **No Waiver**. All waivers must be in writing.

    7. **Validity**. If any part of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such part shall be interpreted to give the maximum force possible to such terms under applicable law and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other part or provision of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.
