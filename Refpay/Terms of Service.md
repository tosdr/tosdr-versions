Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms, User’s obligations under this ARTICLE 5 with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under any applicable law will continue until such time, if ever, as such Confidential Information ceases to qualify for trade secret protection under one or more such applicable laws other than as a result of any act or omission of User or any of its representatives.

**Section 5.04. Compelled Disclosures.** If User or any of its representatives is compelled by applicable law to disclose any Confidential Information then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, User will: (i) promptly, and prior to such disclosure, notify ArbiterSports in writing of such requirement so that ArbiterSports can seek a protective order or other remedy or waive its rights under Section 5.03; and (ii) provide reasonable assistance to ArbiterSports in opposing such disclosure, seeking a protective order or other limitations on disclosure. If ArbiterSports waives compliance or, after providing the notice and assistance required under this Section 5.04, User remains required by law to disclose any Confidential Information, User will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that User is legally required to disclose and, on ArbiterSports’ request, will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from the applicable court or other presiding authority that such Confidential Information will be afforded confidential treatment.
