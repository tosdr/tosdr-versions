As a policy, the names and addresses of CoCoRaHS volunteers are not shared or made public for any reason, with the following two exceptions.  State, regional and local volunteer coordinators may be provided with access to the participant contact list, on an as-needed basis. This list sharing is solely for the purpose of management and operations of the CoCoRaHS network and not for private or commercial use. The master participant list may also be shared with the staff of local National Meteorological Service forecast offices in your area. Sharing of this information is to support their mission of protecting life and property. |     |
