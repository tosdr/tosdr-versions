=============

**General:** The terms and conditions contained herein constitute the entire agreement between Visiplex, Inc. (referred to as Visiplex) and its customer. Visiplex will not be bound by any terms of customer’s order to purchase. No form of acceptance except Visiplex’s written acknowledgement sent to customer, or Visiplex’s commencement of performance, shall constitute valid acceptance of the customer’s order. Any such acceptance is expressly conditioned on assent to the terms hereof and the exclusion of all other terms. The customer shall be deemed to have assented to the terms hereof, whether or not previously received, upon accepting delivery of any product shipped by Visiplex. Visiplex shall not be liable for delay or failure in performance whatsoever due to acts of God, shortage of supplies, transportation difficulties, labor disputes, riots, war, fire, explosion, epidemics, or other occurrences beyond Visiplex’s reasonable control or due to unforeseen circumstances. Visiplex makes no claim as to the suitability for purpose of its product, nor does Visiplex make any guarantees with respect to the level of performance of its product utilized in any given application or use by its customer.

**FCC License:** Each wireless system operator is required by law to file and obtain an FCC license. An FCC license can be obtained directly by the end-user/operator through an authorized agent or by using Visiplex’s service to file for an FCC license through an authorized agent on the end-user’s behalf. It is the end-user’s responsibility to obtain an FCC license for each Visiplex system that includes an RF transmitter. The obtained license is the property of the end-user.

**Pricing:** Price quotations are valid for 30 days. Quantity price discounts may apply to purchase orders with single or multiple ship dates for up to one year. Quantity discount rates may vary depending on product type. Visiplex may change its pricing at any time without prior notice to customer, but such changes shall not affect any accepted orders. All prices are exclusive of taxes and all handling or other charges, including (without limitation), brokerage fees, tariffs, taxes, and transportation charges.

**Order Acceptance:** Written purchase orders are required for all purchases. Each purchase order shall constitute a firm offer and shall indicate specific products, quantity, price, shipping instructions, bill-to and ship-to addresses, and any other special instructions. Any contingencies contained on such order are not binding upon Visiplex. All orders are subject to acceptance by Visiplex, who will accept or reject orders according to Visiplex’s then current practices.

The purchaser is obligated to accept any product built and held in inventory at Visiplex, and for any components ordered for non-standard products.

**Delivery:** Upon receipt of purchase order, Visiplex will provide an estimate of lead-time until delivery. While this is not a binding commitment, Visiplex will make every effort to make delivery based on this estimate. Accelerated deliveries may be available with an additional fee.
