### [Mailchimp](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#mailchimp)

Mailchimp is a service by Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA with which the dispatch of newsletters can be organized and analysed. With the help of Mailchimp we can analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent with Mailchimp, a file contained in the email (“web beacon”) connects to the Mailchimp servers in the USA. This allows you to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of registration, IP address, browser type and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. They are used exclusively for statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.

The mail provider “Mailchimp” receives and processes on our behalf the data necessary for the order, in particular email address, IP address, device name. These data are processed on servers in the USA. Mailchimp is certified according to the “Privacy Shield”. The “Privacy Shield” is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the USA to ensure compliance with European data protection standards in the USA.

If you do not want Mailchimp to analyse your data, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide an unsubscribe link in every newsletter.

Details on Mailchimp and its privacy policy can be found at the following link: [https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/)

The data that are stored for the purpose of newsletter subscription will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from our servers as well as from the servers of Mailchimp after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email address for the use of the Services) remain unaffected.

[Registration and use of the cloud service](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#registration-and-use-of-cloud-service)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use our Apps and cloud service (cloud.pupil-labs.com), you have to register with us, or log in using your previously provided registration details. During the registration process, we ask you - the account holder - to provide us with certain data. Such data will only be sent and provided to us after you click the “Sign Up” button.

We will use your submitted data to carry out your registration with us, provide you with necessary functionalities of the Services based on Art. 6 (1) b. GDPR.

We may contact you via email if you send us a request as well as for purposes related to the use of the Services, based on Art. 6 (1) b.

### [Recording Data](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#recording-data)

Whenever the Neon device is worn on the head of an individual (the “wearer”) and switched to the record mode, each eye of the wearer is filmed by one eye camera integrated into the Neon module. The two eye videos (one from each eye) are fed into a machine learning algorithm which calculates the gaze coordinates and further eye state data like pupil size. Using the Neon module scene camera an egocentric third video is recorded which can serve to visualize the gaze point of the wearer. These videos will be recorded and stored per recording. The data is saved into a recording folder on the cell phone (companion) device. Each recording is part of a “workspace”.

During each recording, metadata are also collected and these include recording timestamps, serial numbers (scene camera and spectacles serial numbers in the case of Pupil Invisible; module serial number in case of Neon), scene camera image coordinates (2D gaze coordinates), smartphone (android) ID/model/name, IMU (gyroscope, accelerometer; in case of Neon also magnetometer) raw data, wearer ID (uuid), audio data (from the scene camera microphone if switched on in case of Pupil Invisible; from the module's microphone in case of Neon), recording events/annotation provided by the user via the real-time API, and the data users provide when using the recording template feature of Pupil Invisible.

The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) b. GDPR.

Account holders can invite others to become members of their workspaces. Members of workspaces can access the data contained in the workspace, including all recording data. The workspace owner can assign members roles to configure their permissions to edit data.

If a workspace member contributes recordings to a workspace owned by another account, they are agreeing to transfer ownership of the recording data to the workspace owner.

### [Training Data](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#training-data) and Calibration

In order to improve individual gaze estimation accuracy, users will be able to perform a special routine for a wearer, where we collect the eye-tracking data and metadata to fine-tune and personalize the gaze estimation pipeline, which can then be used by the the corresponding Neon companion device. For this process, we collect the NEON module serial number, cell phone ID and wearer ID (uuid) and eye video data. The user can furthermore opt in to use the data for improvements of the general eye tracking pipeline.

The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) b. and f. GDPR as the training data is used to improve the accuracy of our service in order to best fulfill the contractual obligations and to improve the quality of our service in general.

If you choose to delete a wearer profile, we will ask you to further use the associated training data to improve the quality of our service. You can request deletion of this data via email. Otherwise, you consent to the processing of this data based on Art. 6 (1) a. GDPR.

### [Other Data](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#other-data)

Beyond the data mentioned above we also handle data to facilitate organization, further processing and enrichment of your recordings. These are:

* Wearer profiles: are pairs of user-provided names and system-provided UUIDs. They are stored locally on the phone and synced with the cloud system when connected. Every recording gets associated with one wearer profile.
    
* Recording templates: are user provided forms that can be filled in by the user with each recording. The form structure is stored on the cloud and phone, the content is stored with each recording.
    
* Data uploaded to the cloud via the web-UI by the user for setting up enrichments (Example: Images for the reference Image Mapper )
    
* Derivative Data that is generated on the cloud platform as the output of further processing of the raw gaze data. For example: calculation of gaze fixations, densification to 200Hz gaze data, gaze mapping onto reference surfaces.
    

### [How are your data stored?](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#how-are-your-data-stored)

Each Pupil Invisible and Neon device is connected to a companion cell phone which serves as a data processing and storage unit and serves as power supply. The videos recorded from each exercise can be securely uploaded from the companion cell phone to Pupil Labs cloud storage, currently hosted by cloud service providers, namely Amazon Web Services Inc. ([https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/)) on servers located in Germany. Such upload is optional and provided via an explicit opt-in procedure. However, we have valid data processing agreements with the aforementioned host providers in order to ensure a high level of security for your personal data.

Once uploaded, you can review recordings on the web and collaborate with your team and colleagues. Your team can collaborate at any stage of the research workflow - from study prep, synchronization of devices in the field, to post-hoc analysis. Recordings are organised and searchable by metadata so you can easily find and filter recordings to download for further analysis.

### [When and by whom is your data accessed?](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#when-and-by-whom-is-your-data-accessed)

As a rule you are the only one that has access to your recordings on the phone. Once you upload recordings to Pupil Cloud, other members of the selected workspace have access to the data. Pupil Labs and its cloud service providers mentioned above will only access your data in Pupil Cloud for the following purposes:

* Relaying your data between the cloud storage system and you. In this case no human will see your data.
    
* Executing automated or user-triggered data processing (e.g. gaze densification, fixation detection, reference surface gaze mapping and other enrichment processings). In this case no human will see your data.
    
* Gathering usage statistics: we will access your recordings and storage metadata as well as enrichment configuration data but never any actual videos, template entries or events.
    
* In case our systems detect errors, we will seek to fix them. If this requires accessing your recording data, we will seek your permission to do so. However, as a general rule we will not access any actual video data in this process, unless the nature of the error requires this and you have given your consent to it
    

### [Duration of the storage of personal data; deletion periods](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#duration-of-the-storage-of-personal-data-deletion-periods)

As a rule, we only store your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the execution of the contract or the respective purpose and limit the storage period to an absolutely necessary minimum. Therefore, we delete your personal data, if your use of the Services ends and you have not agreed to a further use. An extended storage will only occur, if there is a legal obligation or if you have consented to do so.

[Automated Decision Making (""Profiling)](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/privacy/privacy#automated-decision-making)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not process any data via “profiling” or in the form of automated decision making via the Services. Profiling means any automated processing of personal data consisting in the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to the performance of work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or relocation of that natural person. Examples of such profiling include the analysis of data (e.g. based on statistical methods) with the aim of displaying personalized advertising to the user or giving shopping tips.
