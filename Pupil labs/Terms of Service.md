==========================================

Last updated: 2024-10-10

[1\. General](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/invisible-companion-terms-of-use#general)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1. These terms of use (the “Terms”) apply to the mobile companion application “Pupil Invisible Companion App” (the “App” or “Service(s)”) provided by Pupil Labs GmbH, registered with the German Commercial Register of the district court AG Charlottenburg (registration number HRB 155541), Sanderstraße 28, 12047 Berlin (“Pupil Labs”; “We”).

1.2. Pupil Labs may amend the Terms pursuant to section 14 hereof.

1.3. The Terms apply to any user using the App (a “User”, “Users”) after having accepted these Terms by registering according to Section 3 (Registration/Sign-up) below and are a binding agreement between Pupil Labs and the User.

1.4. The Service offerings of Pupil Labs are available to both Consumers and Business Customers (as defined below). For the purpose of these Terms, (i) a „Consumer“ is any individual entering into the contract for a purpose not related to their business, trade or self-employed professional activity (Sec. 13 of the German Civil Code), and (ii) a „Business Customer“ is a User (whether an individual, company or partnership vested with legal capacity) who enters into the relevant contract in the conduct of their business or self-employed professional activity (Sec. 14 (1) of the German Civil Code).

1.5. Terms and conditions provided by a User do not apply, regardless of whether or not Pupil Lab has expressly objected to them in a particular case.

[2\. About the App](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/invisible-companion-terms-of-use#about-the-app)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. The App enables the User to create multiple “wearers” (a “Wearer”, jointly “Wearers”) and to record, view and delete data generated by an eye tracking device offered by Pupil Labs (Pupil Invisible, “PI”). The App can only be used together with PI. A Wearer can be assigned a nickname by the User and will also automatically be assigned a unique ID (uuid).

2.2. The precise system requirements and the full scope of functions of the App are found in the product description on the distribution platform used to download the App (the “Play Store”) and on Pupil Labs’ website https://www.pupil-labs.com (the “Website”).

2.3. Pupil Labs reserves the right to extend the Services and make improvements if they (i) serve technical progress; or (ii) appear necessary to prevent misuse. Further, Pupil Labs shall be entitled to change the Services if (i) applicable law, court rulings or administrative decisions require such amendments; (ii) the changes are only beneficial to the User; or (iii) the changes are of a purely technical or procedural nature with no material effect on the User. All other changes to the Services shall be subject to section 14 hereof.

2.4. Pupil Labs may also provide updates for the App free of charge in the respective Play Store, which change the scope of functions of the App. The exact system requirements and the complete scope of functions of such updates and the updated version of the App can be found in the product and update description in the corresponding Play Store.

[3\. Registration/Sign-up](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/invisible-companion-terms-of-use#registration-signup)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. The usage of the App requires the registration as well as the set-up of a user account (the “User Account”) by filling in the name and an email address as well as a password. As an alternative way to register the User may use their its existing Google account. In both cases during the initial registration by pressing an “Agree and continue” Button or checking a respective checkbox, the User submits an offer on the conclusion of the agreement to use the App according to the Terms (the “Agreement”) as well as the Privacy Policy of Pupil Labs. In order to use the App, the User must also accept our Terms of Service of Pupil Cloud (see section 5 below). Pupil Labs will accept this offer by sending the User a confirmation email or by providing the Service to the User.

3.2. The User shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the password is at all times kept confidential. The User shall notify Pupil Labs by contacting info@pupil-labs.com without undue delay if there are signs of unauthorized use of their User Account or any breach of security by a third party. The User is not authorized to grant the use of the User Account to any third party. The User is responsible for all activity that occurs on their User Account. Pupil Labs shall not be liable for loss or damages caused by any unauthorized use of the User Account or loss or unauthorized use of the data to access the User Account.

3.3. The registration is free of charge.

[4\. Wearer Personalization Service](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/invisible-companion-terms-of-use#wearer-training-service)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1. Pupil Labs offers Users the ability to personalize parameters for their wearers. This personalization improves individual eye state and gaze accuracy.

4.2. The Training is part of the free basic plan. This offer may change pursuant to the Terms.

[5\. Pupil Cloud](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/invisible-companion-terms-of-use#pupil-cloud)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1. In addition to the functions of the App as part of the Service, Pupil Labs offers the User certain cloud based services that can be accessed via the App (“Pupil Cloud”). Pupil Cloud enables the User to manage, view and further process PI generated data more easily.

5.2. In order to use the App, the the following functions of Pupil Cloud Service are used: authentication/login, creation and synchronization of Wearers and templates. The User therefore must accept the terms of service for Pupil Cloud that can be found under [https://www.pupil-labs.com/legal/cloud-terms-of-service](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/cloud-terms-of-service). The uploading of User made recordings to Pupil Cloud is optional and can enabled via the App.

[6\. Availability](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/invisible-companion-terms-of-use#availability)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1. Online services provided are usually available 24 hours a day. Pupil Labs provides no guarantee that the App and the services and functions operate properly and are available without interruption and errors at all times. The User must ensure an adequate Internet connection. The User is responsible for the fulfillment of the system requirements necessary for the use of the App, particularly with respect to the operating system used by it. However, Pupil Labs shall make every effort, within the limits of what is commercially reasonable, to enable the operation of the App without interruptions or errors at all times.

6.2. Pupil Labs may restrict the availability of and access to the App, the Services and functions for the security of the network operation and the maintenance of the network integrity, especially to avoid serious disruptions of the network. Pupil Labs tries to keep these disruptions on a low level.

[7\. Termination](https://pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use/invisible-companion-terms-of-use#termination)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.1. The User may terminate the Agreement, and thereby the User Account, at any time for any or no reason by sending an email to info@pupil-labs.com. If the User cancels their User Account and still has a valid paid subscription for Pupil Cloud, any amount the User may already have paid for the subscription will not be refunded.

7.2. Pupil Labs shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement with a notice period of three (3) months, however, not within the first two (2) years after the purchase of PI by the User.

7.3. The right of termination for cause and without notice remains unaffected for both parties. A good cause for termination shall include, but shall not be limited to, any of the following events:

7.3.1. the User fails to comply with any applicable legal provisions; and/or

7.3.2. the User fails to comply with any terms of these Terms of Use, in particular section 9, and, where reasonable, Pupil Labs has given the User the opportunity to stop any misconduct but the User failed to do so.
