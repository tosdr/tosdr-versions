1. A few important notices—arbitration, refunds, class actions and damages



US residents - We want to be super upfront about three important things: First, by

using our services you are agreeing to arbitrate almost all disputes rather than have

them heard in a court of law or by a jury. Second, if you are in the US you are

agreeing not to participate in a class action lawsuit against us. Third, unless

otherwise stated herein and to the extent allowed by law, all purchases are non-

refundable.



IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR US RESIDENTS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THIS EULA

YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US

THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY

SECTIONS 22 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. THIS EULA ALSO

INCLUDES A WAIVER OF RIGHTS BY YOU TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US AND A LIMITATION ON

DAMAGES THAT YOU CAN COLLECT FROM US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. BY

USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE PROVISIONS.



IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL, COPY, OR USE OUR

SERVICES. WE DO NOT NORMALLY OFFER REFUNDS, EXCEPT WHERE EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY US

(SEE SECTION 10 FOR EXCEPTIONS), OR WHERE REFUNDS ARE REQUIRED UNDER LOCAL LAW.



OUR EULA MAY ALSO CONTAIN COUNTRY-SPECIFIC ADDENDA THAT APPLY TO YOU BASED ON THE

JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU RESIDE. To see additional terms applicable to you (which constitute part

of this agreement and may supersede these terms), please check the country-specific language on the

EULA website.



2. What is this document? When can I play?

This is the agreement between you and us for our services you download or access,

whether that’s a game, something that supports the game, or something else. You

can only use these things once you agree to these terms.



You are now reading our End User License Agreement (“EULA”) which is a legal agreement between you

and 10 Chambers AB (“we”, “us”, “our”, as appropriate) regarding the Services you use from us. “Services”

mean collectively, and sometimes individually, the following: (a) each of our Games, and (b) any websites,

software or other services we provide with or in support of the Game, whether or not they are installed

or used on a computer, console, or a mobile device. “Game” means our game that you download and

access that is subject to this EULA, regardless of where you download and/or access it, and any

documentation, software, updates, Virtual Goods and Content (each defined below) included in it.



We’ve tried to be straightforward in this EULA, and if you have any questions feel free to send us a note

at support@10chambers.com (our “Support Email Address”). You’ll notice that we added some text in

italics throughout the EULA to make it easier to read; however, this text is provided for guidance only, and

does not form part of the EULA.



3. Defined Terms



You’ll notice some capitalized terms in this EULA. They’re called “defined terms,” and we use them so we

don’t have to repeat the same language again and again, and to make sure that the use of these terms is

consistent throughout the EULA. We’ve included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be

easy for you to read them in context.



4. Additional Terms



Some Services may be available (or only available) through accessing (or downloading from) a third-party

platform or store, including but not limited to, Facebook, the Epic Games Store, Steam game platform,

the Google Play Store and Apple App Store (each, an “App Store”). Your use of the Services is also

governed by any applicable agreements you have with any App Store (the “App Store Agreement(s)”). In

the event of a conflict between any other App Store Agreement(s) from which you acquire one of our

Games and this EULA with respect to your use of the Services, this EULA will take priority.

The collection of information from you and related to the Services (whether obtained through an App

Store or not) is governed by our Privacy Policy at www.gtfothegame.com/Privacy. Our Privacy Policy

explains how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect from and about you.

5. Eligibility and Registration



The Services we offer have certain age restrictions. Others may require an outside

account. When you give us information, you need to make sure it stays up to date.

Also, don’t share your account with others without our permission.

(a) Age. To create a Game Account (as defined below) and access some of our Services, you

must be at least the minimum age for consenting to personal data collection under the law in your

jurisdiction. If you are between the minimum age for personal data collection and age of majority

in your jurisdiction, your parent or guardian must review this EULA and accept it on your behalf.

Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of their children under 18 years of age when

using our Services.



We may allow a minor under the minimum age for personal data collection to register for certain

Services with the verified consent of a parent or legal guardian. The parent/legal guardian may be

asked to provide additional documentation or perform additional actions as part of the

verification and approval process as consistent with applicable law. We recommend that parents

and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on the devices they provide their

child.



(b) Account Creation. To access parts of a Game, you may need to create an in-game account

(your “Game Account”). Your Game Account, if applicable, is separate from any account you may

have with any App Store (your “App Store Account”). You may be able to create your Game

Account using an existing account you have with us or your email address. To the extent you

create your Game Account through the use of a third-party account (for example, your account

with Facebook or Google), we may access certain personal information that this third party

provides to us such as your email address and name to help create your Game Account. Further

information about use of third-party accounts is provided in the Privacy Policy at

www.gtfothegame.com/Privacy. Please note that you may also be able to play the Game without

creating a Game Account, but you may not be able to access certain parts of the Game, and your

Game data may be deleted if you uninstall or otherwise delete the Game.



(c) No Account Sharing. You may not sell, resell, rent, lease, share or provide access to your

Game Account to anyone else. We reserve all available legal rights and remedies to prevent

unauthorized use of our Services, including, but not limited to, technological barriers, IP mapping,

and, in serious cases, directly contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) regarding such

unauthorized use.



(d) No False Accounts. You may not create a Game Account for anyone else or create a Game

Account in a name other than your own.



6. License and Use of the Services



As long as you agree to this EULA (and as long as the EULA isn’t terminated—see

Section 21), we grant you permission to access and use our Services. If you break the

rules or can’t agree, we can’t let you play. Please ensure your system and devices

meet the minimum requirements for the Game. Also, if you suffer from an epileptic

condition, please talk to a doctor before playing the Game.



(a) License Grant. So long as you comply with this EULA and, as applicable, the App Store

Agreement(s), we grant you the following license: a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable,

non-sublicensable limited right and license to (i) download and install the Game on the device

permitted by the App Store Agreement(s) (if applicable), and (ii) access and use the Services,

including any Content, for your personal entertainment purposes leveraging only the functionality

of the Game and Services. We and our licensors reserve all rights not granted to you in this EULA.

“Content” means all artwork, titles, themes, objects, characters, names, dialogue, catch phrases,

stories, animation, concepts, sounds, audio-visual effects, methods of operation, musical

compositions, and any other content within the Services. Content also includes anything

generated, created, or that is otherwise developed within the Services by any user (including you)

as a result of interaction with the functionality of the Services. We also grant you a limited license

to make gameplay videos for certain Games, specified on the Services provided that you agree

that all such gameplay video activity is subject to your agreement to and pursuant to our

Streaming Policy in Schedule C-1. We may, in our sole discretion, remove, edit or disable any

Content for any reason.



(b) Content You Create Outside the Services. “User Content” means any Content that you (or

other Game Account holders) create or obtain outside the Services that you or another user

makes available within the Services. To be clear, if Content is created within the Services, it is not

User Content; only Content created or obtained from outside the Services that a user then makes

available within the Services is User Content. By making any User Content available through the

Services you hereby grant to us the following license: a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide,

royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works

based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection

with operating and providing the Services and Content to you and to other users of the Services.

Except to the extent prohibited by law, you waive the benefit of any “moral rights” or “droit moral”

or similar rights in any country to any User Content. We may, in our sole discretion, remove, edit

or disable any User Content at any time and for any reason, including if we determine that the

User Content violates this EULA. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for User Content,

for removing it, or not removing it or other Content. We do not pre-screen or review any User

Content and do not approve or endorse any User Content that may be available on the Services

or our other services.



(c) Service Limits Based on Where You Live. We may restrict, modify, or limit your access to

and use of certain Content, Virtual Goods, an entire Game, or any or all of the Services depending

on the territory in which you are located. Without limiting the foregoing, Content, Virtual Goods,

entire Games, or the Services may not be available (in whole or in part) where you are located or

may only be available in a modified version, if they do not comply with the laws which apply in

your country.



(d) Retail Purchase. We may offer codes or product keys that can be activated in a Game or

used to activate a Game on the App Store. Subject to foreign exchange control regulations

applicable in your jurisdiction, such codes or keys must be purchased (or otherwise obtained

legally) through us or one of our authorized retailers to be valid. If you purchase such a code or

key from a third party, that third party is responsible for addressing any issues you have with these

codes or keys. Subject to applicable law, we will have no responsibility for these codes or keys

purchased from any third party or if any purchase occurred in breach with any applicable foreign

exchange control regulations.



(e) Minimum Requirements. The Game may have minimum requirements for the devices and

systems on which you wish to play the Game. We may publish these minimum requirements on

the applicable website and/or otherwise notify you in writing. For an optimal experience, please

ensure that your devices and systems will meet these requirements before playing the Game.



(f) Seizure Warning. The Game may contain flashing lights, images, and other luminous

stimulations which may induce epileptic seizures in certain individuals. If you or anyone in your

household has an epileptic condition, please consult your doctor before playing any Game. If you

experience dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any

involuntary movement, or convulsions while playing, please immediately discontinue playing the

Game and consult your doctor.



7. Player Conduct



We strive to make all of our players and users feel safe and welcome when using our

Services and playing our games and we want everyone to play by the same rules. So,

if you use our Services as intended, without cheating, being abusive, disruptive or

disrespectful, or being unfair, you are probably in the clear, but please read all of the

terms of this EULA carefully to be sure.

8. Ownership of the Services



Our Service including our Content and Games is owned by us or our licensors. Our

Services may let you upload, post and store photos and other content that you own.

You retain your ownership of this content, to which we take a license.



We and our affiliates and licensors own all title, ownership and intellectual property rights in the Services.

You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary

rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services. You understand and agree that you have no

ownership interest in the Services or any Games or Content therein. The Services (and particularly our

Games) may have built-in mechanisms designed to prevent granting one user an unfair advantage over

other users (these actions are “Cheating” and the software is the “Cheat Detection Software”). We may

add or update our Cheat Detection Software periodically as we may require in our sole discretion. The

Services and/or the Cheat Detection Software may collect and transmit details about your Game Account,

gameplay, and unauthorized programs or processes in connection with Cheating, subject to our Privacy

Policy and applicable law. In the event that we in our sole discretion conclude that you are Cheating, you

agree that we may exercise any or all of our rights under this EULA, including termination of this EULA and

your access to our Services. In addition, if you Cheat in one Game or Service, we may terminate your

license to use all of our Games and Services.



Although we are not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Services or to review or edit any Content,

we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating and publishing the Services, to ensure compliance

with this EULA, to protect the health or safety of anyone that we believe may be threatened, to protect

our legal rights and remedies, to report a crime or offensive behavior, or to comply with applicable law.

We may (but don’t have to) remove or disable access to any Content, at any time and without notice. We

may (but don’t have to) investigate violations of this EULA or conduct that affects the Services.



9. Transaction

We may offer you some cool features in our games for which you must pay. We need

special permission to charge your payment method. These features are owned by us.



(a) Purchasing or Obtaining Virtual Goods and Game Currency. When you purchase in-game

currency (“Game Currency”), any digital add-on items (“Virtual Goods”) that we may offer, or a

Game itself (each, a “Transaction”), your purchase will be made through the functionality

available through the App Store or other platforms we make available to you. Prior to making a

Transaction, you should make sure you fully understand the agreement that covers your

Transaction, whether that agreement is an App Store Agreement or another payment platform

agreement.



10. Refunds



Subject to applicable law (including as described in each country-specific addendum below), or App Store

policy, (i) all Games, Virtual Goods and Game Currency remain our property, have no monetary value and

are not redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any other alternate remedy for any “real world” money or

anything of monetary value, unless they are defective, unavailable, or do not perform in accordance with

the specifications we provide; (ii) we may revoke your license to such Games, Virtual Goods and/or Game

Currency at any time consistent with this EULA without notice or liability to you; and (iii) except where

the law in your jurisdiction provides a right of withdrawal that cannot be waived by contract, by

purchasing and using any Games, Virtual Goods and/or Game Currency, you hereby waive your right to

withdraw from your agreement to purchase the applicable Game, Virtual and/or Game Currency and you

agree that you will therefore not be eligible to receive a refund (or any alternative remedy) in relation to

such Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency. Additionally, you hereby agree that any withdrawal right

expires immediately upon purchase and delivery of your Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency,

unless the law in your jurisdiction provides otherwise. This section does not affect your statutory rights.



11. Beta Testing



From time to time we may offer a beta version of one of our Services (a “Beta”). As the name implies,

Betas are not commercial launch versions, are not guaranteed to work properly, and may make other

parts of your system not work properly as well. For the license granted to you in Section 6 above to extend

to the Beta (meaning, for you to have permission to use the Beta), you acknowledge and agree to the

following terms in addition to the rest of this EULA:



(a) We may automatically delete or modify the information stored on your computer related

to the Beta for any reason at any time during the duration of the Beta test;



(b) We may terminate the Beta test at any time, which would then render your Beta

unplayable or unable to function properly. When we terminate a Beta, you must delete the local

Beta instance on your computer and all documents and materials you received from us in

connection with the Beta;



(c) Use of a Beta is subject to confidential treatment of that Beta and all elements thereof.

"Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by us to you, or accessed or provided

by you, in relation to the Beta (including any feedback provided and the Game itself). You agree

that you will:



(i) not use any Confidential Information other than as necessary to use the Beta in

accordance with this EULA;



(ii) maintain Confidential Information in strict confidence and use the same degree

of care to protect it as you use to protect your own confidential information, but in no

circumstances less than reasonable care;



(iii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any person or entity other than as

permitted by us; and



(iv) not make any public announcements related to Beta or the Service, including

publishing or disclosing any information (e.g. screenshots and specifications) relating to the Beta,

without our prior written approval, which we may grant or withhold in our sole discretion.



(d) Termination of a Beta by us is not grounds for any kind of refund and your participation

in a Beta does not entitle you to any compensation or any free Services, including any Content

and Game Currency; and



If and when we release a full (non-Beta) version of the particular Game and we may allow your

use of the Game to continue to the full version. If so allowed by us, your continued use of the

Game will no longer be subject to this Section 11 but will still be subject to the rest of this EULA.



12. App Store; Console Games



If a Game is made available to you via an App Store, or if you play a Game on a

console, then additional terms may apply.



Where a Game is made available to you via an App Store (whether on your mobile device or console) you

acknowledge and agree to the terms in Schedule B-1 with respect to such Game.



13. Feedback



We’d love to hear your feedback, good or bad. It helps us improve! But if you give us

feedback, we need to be free to use it how we want and without paying you.



If you provide us with any Feedback, you hereby grant us the following license: a non-exclusive,

transferable, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free license, with the right to

sublicense, under any and all intellectual property rights that you own or control to use, copy, modify,

create derivative works based upon, distribute copies of, publicly perform, publicly display and otherwise

exploit the Feedback for any purpose and in any country. This license does not lapse or expire even if we

do not exercise our rights under this license within a period of one year. If you have rights in the Feedback

that cannot be licensed to us under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby

waive and agree not to assert those rights. You understand and agree that you are freely giving your

Feedback, that we don’t have to use it, and that you will not be compensated in any way for your Feedback.

You represent and warrant that you have rights in any Feedback that you provide to us sufficient to grant

us and other affected parties the rights described above, including, without limitation, intellectual

property rights or rights of publicity or privacy.



In posting such Feedback, you warrant that your feedback is in compliance with this EULA and you will not

use obscene or offensive language or submit any material that is, or may potentially be, defamatory,

abusive or hateful, an invasion of anyone's privacy, harmful to other users, or in breach of any applicable

law.



14. DMCA/Copyright Policy



We respect copyright law and expect our users to do the same. It’s our policy to terminate in appropriate

circumstances Game Accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing

the rights of copyright holders.



15. Third-Party Websites and Resources



Outside links are for your convenience, but we can’t guarantee them.



The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. We provide these links only as a

convenience and are not responsible for the content, products or services on or available from those

websites or resources or links displayed on such websites. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and

assume all risk arising from, your use of any third-party websites or resources.



16. Data Charges and Mobile Devices



This is a reminder that you’re responsible for any data-related charges that you may

incur for using our Services.



You are responsible for all data-related charges that you may incur for using our Services, including,

without limitation, mobile, text-messaging, and data charges. You should understand or ask your service

provider what charges you may incur before using the Services.



17. Service and EULA Modifications



When we update this EULA, you need to agree to the updated version to keep using

our Services. We also need the freedom to update any part of the Services whenever

we see fit, so we are letting you know we can do so at any time.

We may (but don’t have to) update this EULA at any time whenever we think there is a need. Subject to

applicable law, if we do so, you will be prompted to agree to the updated EULA upon your next access to

the Services or when the updated EULA is otherwise communicated to you. You must agree to these

updates to continue using the Services.



We may provide patches, updates, or upgrades to the Services that must be installed in order for you to

continue to use the Services. We may update the Services remotely without notifying you, and you hereby

consent to us applying such patches, updates, and upgrades. If your device can prevent automatic updates,

you may not be able to access the Services until you manually update the Services yourself on your device.

We may modify, suspend, discontinue, substitute, replace, or limit your access to any aspect of the

Services at any time. Subject to applicable law, you acknowledge that any character data, game progress,

game customization or other data related to your use of any particular Game and other elements unique

to the Services may cease to be available to you at any time without notice from us, including, without

limitation, after a patch, update, or upgrade is applied by us. You agree that we do not have any

maintenance or support obligations with respect to the Services.



Subject to applicable law, we may change the price of the Services, Games, Virtual Goods, Game Currency

or Content, at any time, for any reason, without notice or liability to you.



18. Warranty Disclaimers



We don’t make any guarantees about the Services.



TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT

WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANY PARTIES EXPLICITLY

DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,

QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF

DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. The Company Parties make no warranty that the Services will meet your

requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. The Company Parties make

no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of the

Services.



19. Limitation of Liability



This section limits what you can recover from us in a dispute.



TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THE COMPANY PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE

IN ANY WAY FOR ANY:



(a) LOSS OF PROFITS,



(b) LOST REVENUE,

(c) LOST SAVINGS,



(d) LOSS OF DATA, OR



(e) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY

DAMAGES,



ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA OR THE SERVICES, OR THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO

USE OR LACK OF FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF ONE OF A COMPANY PARTY’S

FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, BREACH OF

CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE AND EVEN IF THAT COMPANY PARTY HAS BEEN

ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FURTHER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY

APPLICABLE LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA OR THE SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED: (A) THE TOTAL AMOUNTS YOU HAVE

PAID (IF ANY) OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO US FOR THE PARTICULAR GAME OR SERVICE IN QUESTION

DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; OR

(B) IF (A) DOES NOT APPLY, FIFTY DOLLARS ($50 USD). THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS REGARDING

DAMAGES APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION AND ARE

FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow the

exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability as stated above, so the above terms may not

apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing exclusions and limitations will apply to the

maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in

your jurisdiction, and nothing in this EULA will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of

the Services.



20. Indemnity



If someone sues us based on your breach of this EULA or your access or use of the

Services, you agree to defend us or pay for our defense in that lawsuit.



You agree to indemnify (in other words, compensate for all and any losses incurred), pay the defense costs

of, and hold the Company Parties and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and other

representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses

(including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise out of or in any

way are connected with: (a) your access to or use of the Services; or (b) any claim that, if true, would

constitute a breach by you of this EULA. You agree to reimburse us for any payments made or loss suffered

by us, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 20.



21. Termination



We reserve the right to terminate this EULA as we see fit in accordance with the

applicable law. Reasons we may terminate this EULA include, but are not limited to:

if we wind down our game offerings in your region, if you violate this EULA, or if the

App Store terminates your App Store Account.



To the fullest extent consistent with applicable law, we may suspend, modify or terminate your access to

and use of the Services, including any Game, Virtual Goods, and Content, with no liability or notice to you

in the event that (a) we cease providing the Game to similarly situated users generally; (b) you breach any

terms of this EULA (including the App Store Agreement(s) and our other policies specified in this EULA);

(c) the owner of the applicable App Store terminates your App Store Account; or (d) we otherwise deem

it necessary to suspend or modify your access to and use of the Services or terminate this EULA in our sole

discretion. You may also terminate this EULA by deleting and uninstalling the Game on any and all of your

devices or by deleting your App Store Account. A suspension or modification of your access to and use of

the Services will result in your inability to access and use some or all features of the Services, as

determined by us in our sole discretion. Upon any termination of this EULA, the rights granted to you will

automatically terminate, you may no longer exercise any of those rights or this EULA. Subject to applicable

law, we may, in our sole discretion, provide continued access to and use of the Services after such

termination.



Where required by applicable law, termination of this EULA does not require a court decision to affect

termination or a notice served by a court bailiff as a prerequisite to termination.



Except to the extent required by law, all payments and fees are non-refundable under all circumstances,

regardless of whether or not this EULA has been terminated.



The following sections will survive termination of this EULA: 8 (first two sentences only), 13, 19, 20, 22

through 25, and this sentence of Section 21.



22. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law – United States



This section only applies if you are accessing, using, or have purchased the Services in the United States.



You agree that any disputes between us will be handled by binding arbitration under

California law.



(a) Governing Law and Forum Choice. This EULA and any action related thereto, including but

not limited to any dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or relating to this EULA,

a Game, or the Services, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or

termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating

to this EULA, a Game, or the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the Federal

Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to

its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section 22, the

exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and we are not required to arbitrate

will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and we

each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

US residents—if there is a dispute between us, we agree we’ll resolve it through

arbitration (in your home area) instead of through the courts. You are also agreeing

not to participate in a class-action lawsuit against us. (This section is long, so we’re

providing mini-explanations for each part.)



(b) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any Dispute will be resolved solely

by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or

proceeding. You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and

enforcement of this EULA, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to

participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this EULA.



(c) Location of Arbitration. If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take

place in your county of residence, to the exclusion of all other venues.



Disputes that qualify for small claims court or relate to the infringement of our

intellectual property do not have to be arbitrated.



(d) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 22(b) above: (i) we may both seek to resolve

a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or

other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of

our intellectual property rights.



The American Arbitration Association’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply.

Arbitration will be near where you live unless we agree otherwise.



(e) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the

American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”)

then in effect, except as modified by this EULA. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by

calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand

for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA

provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.



Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both

agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority

to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this

arbitration agreement.

Unless your claim is frivolous or for more than $10,000, we’ll pay the filing,

administration, and arbitrator fees. We won’t seek attorney fees from you, but if you

win you can seek them from us to the extent allowed by law.



(f) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed

by the AAA Rules. We’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your

Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in

arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you.

If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the

extent provided under applicable law.



Except for Section (d), the arbitration may only award injunctive relief for the party

seeking injunctive relief, and to the extent necessary to provide that relief. Any public

injunctive relief sought must be litigated in a civil court.



(g) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section (d) above, the arbitrator

shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may

award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only

to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent

that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has

the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the

public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent

jurisdiction and not in arbitration. You and we agree that litigation of any issues of public

injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in

arbitration.



You agree not to participate in a class action and only bring claims as an individual.

Your dispute can’t be combined with other people’s claims.



(h) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE

OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS

MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’

dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's

claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class

proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this

Dispute Resolution (Section 22) shall be null and void.



If a court decides a part of this section is unenforceable, the rest still applies.

(i) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 22(h) above, if an

arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this EULA is invalid or

unenforceable, the other parts of this EULA will still apply.



23. No Assignment



You cannot transfer or assign this EULA to anyone else.



You may not assign or transfer this EULA, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written

consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this EULA, without such consent, will be null and void.

Notwithstanding the title of this Section, we may freely assign or transfer this EULA without restriction.

Subject to the foregoing, this EULA will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and

permitted assigns.



24. Miscellaneous



This EULA is our whole agreement (no outside promises). The official version is

English. If parts of this EULA don’t apply, the rest remains as much as possible. If we

don’t enforce part of this EULA, it doesn’t mean we won’t in the future or we won’t

enforce our other rights. Also, except for App Stores, no one other than you or us can

enforce this EULA.



(a) Entire Agreement. This EULA and any other document or information referred to in this

EULA constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding between you and us regarding the

Services and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between

you and us regarding the Services.



(b) Language. The original language of this EULA is in English; any translations are provided

for reference purposes only. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any

right you may have under the law of your country to have this EULA written or construed in any

other language.



(c) Severability. This EULA describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the

laws of your jurisdiction. This EULA does not change your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction

if the laws of your jurisdiction do not permit it to do so. As noted above, limitations and exclusions

of warranties and remedies in this EULA may not apply to you because your jurisdiction may not

allow them in your particular circumstance. In the event that certain provisions of this EULA are

held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, those provisions will be

enforced only to the furthest extent possible under applicable law and, with the exception of any

provisions in Section 22(h), the remaining terms of this EULA will remain in full force and effect.



(d) No Waiver. Your and our actions or inactions will not create any other rights under this

EULA except as what is explicitly written within this EULA. Our failure to enforce any right or

provision of this EULA will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any

such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by one of our duly authorized

representatives. Except as expressly set forth in this EULA, the exercise by either party of any of

its remedies under this EULA will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this EULA or

otherwise.



(e) Third-Party Rights. Except as described in Section 12, a person who is not a party to this

EULA will have no right under to enforce any of its terms.
