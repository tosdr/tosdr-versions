rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our servers for the Game are located in Sweden. We also

have support, engineering and other teams who may support the Game including from Sweden and

Only where necessary will we share your personal information with third parties. Situations where

this occur are:



• Third parties that provide services in support of the Game, including providers for the purpose

of processing support ticket ID and support communication, managing our social media

platforms, processing gameplay and game rendering data to provide game analytics to

improve gameplay, and for the purpose of providing marketing and advertisements and

monitor the success of our marketing and advertising programs. All companies providing

services for us are prohibited from retaining, using, or disclosing your personal information

safety, security, or compliance with the law. There are circumstances in which we are legally

required to disclose information about you to authorities, such as to comply with a legal

obligation or processes, enforce our terms, address issues relating to security or fraud, or

protect our users. These disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or

without notice, in compliance with the terms of valid legal process such as a subpoena, court

order, or search warrant. We are usually prohibited from notifying you of any such disclosures

by the terms of the legal process. We may seek your consent to disclose information in

response to a governmental entity’s request when that governmental entity has not provided

the required subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We may also disclose your information

to:



o enforce our terms and conditions and other agreements, including investigation of

any potential violation thereof;

o detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or



o protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users, a third party or the public as

required or permitted by law (exchanging information with other companies and

organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).



• A third party that acquires all or substantially all of us or our business. We may also disclose

your information to third parties if we either: (a) sell, transfer, merge, consolidate or re-

organise any part(s) of our business, or merge with, acquire or form a joint venture with, any

or other third party involved in such change to our business; or (b) sell or transfer any of our

and may be transferred to any prospective buyer, new owner, or other third party involved in

such sale or transfer.



6. The Security of Your Personal Information



We are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your personal information no matter

where it is stored. We have information security and access policies that limit access to our systems

and technology, and we protect data through the use of technological protection measures such as

encryption.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we

will implement and maintain reasonable measures to protect your personal information, we cannot

guarantee the security of the information transmitted through the Game or otherwise via the Internet;

8. Your Rights



Some jurisdictions’ laws grant specific rights to users of the Game, which are set out in this section.



This section entitled “Your Rights” applies to users that are located in the Relevant Jurisdictions. If

you are located in a territory outside a Relevant Jurisdiction, please refer to the Supplemental

Jurisdiction-Specific Terms for an overview of your rights and how these can be exercised.



The sub-section entitled “Advertising” also apply to users that are located in Japan, Korea, United

States and Australia.



You have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you, depending on where

you are located. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below).

We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within

one month (though this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To

exercise any of your rights, please contact us at privacy@10chambers.com.



Access

You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we

share it with. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account

by logging into your account. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you, please

contact us at privacy@10chambers.com.



Portability



You have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This

comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., information

collected to provide our newsletter) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., account name), as

described above in the section “How We Use Your Personal Information”. You have the right to receive

this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right

to request that we transfer that personal information to another party, with certain exceptions. We

will provide further information to you about this if you make such a request.

If you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that

party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we

may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s

rights (for example, where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal

information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).



Correction

You have the right to correct any of your personal information we hold that is inaccurate. You can

access the personal information we hold about you by logging into your Game account. If you believe

we hold any other personal information about you and that information is inaccurate, please contact

us at privacy@10chambers.com.



Erasure



You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your Game

account. If there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to

erase, please contact us at privacy@10chambers.com.

We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for

us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you

know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been

made available publicly on the Game and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps

to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal

information to erase it too.



Restriction of Processing to Storage Only

You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other

than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing

the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws

for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). As above,

where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom

we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.



Objection



You have the right to object to our processing of your personal information. We will consider your

request in other circumstances as detailed below by contacting us at privacy@10chambers.com.



To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw any consent you

previously provided to us for certain processing activities by contacting us at

privacy@10chambers.com. Where consent is required to process your personal information, if you do

not consent to the processing or if you withdraw your consent we may not be able to deliver the

expected service.



Announcements

We may from time to time send you announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (for

example, when we temporarily suspend access to the Game for maintenance, or security, privacy or

administrative-related communications). You may not opt-out of these service-related

announcements, which are not promotional in nature.
