We may collect this or other information you choose to provide when you request a service demonstration from us, fill out a form on our website, reach out to us via email, or otherwise communicate with us. We use this information to communicate with you and provide you with information that you request from us, including marketing communications and promotions.

**Other Information Collection, Logging, and Automatically Collected Information**

In all cases, we may collect and use other information you choose to provide or with your consent.

In addition, if you interact with any of our websites or online services, your browser or device will be subject to collection of logging and other automatically collected information. This includes information collection via cookies, web beacons, and other automatically collected information. This information may include your IP address, date and time you access our websites or online services and the pages and content you access during your visit, websites that you link to or from, whether you receive or open an email or other communication from us (or via our Services), and the links you click on within those emails. We may also collect information from your mobile device or your computer about how you interact with our website or online services, including the time of arrival and length of visit, the type of device used and the operating system on that device, browser type, a list of files downloaded or pages viewed, and any errors encountered.

**How We Secure Information**

We are committed to maintaining measures to protect the security of your information. For example, we use the following methods subject to our internal policies and procedures:

* **Encryption**: We utilize encryption to protect confidential and sensitive user information, including encryption controls at rest and in transit.
* **Authentication**: We require users who maintain an account with us to authenticate their identity using a username and strong password or single sign-on solution. This helps ensure that only authorized users can access the information.
* **Additional Information Protection Services**: We use other measures (information backup, firewall, anti-virus) to protect our systems as well.

Of course, despite these measures, no network or system is ever entirely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of networks and systems that we operate or that are operated on our behalf.

**Information Retention**

If you are an Educator, Parent, or Student, please note that we may retain your information for the duration of our Services as provided to your school or organization, or after you terminate your use of the Services in line with our information backup procedures and according to the terms in our contractual agreement with the Customer. We may keep your information for longer periods if required to protect or defend against claims, as required by federal, state, or local law, or as permitted under applicable contractual terms.

In certain circumstances, such as when the information is subject to litigation, we may retain the information for extended periods as required.

**How We Share Information**

We may share your information with third parties as reasonable to operate our business, to provide the General Website and Services to you and others, as permitted or required by law, or as directed or authorized by you.

Intra-Service Sharing. If you are a School Account Manager, Educator, Parent, or Student, your information may be accessible to other Service users. For instance, if you are a Parent of a Student, information in your Student’s profile may be accessible to other users of our Service, including those Educators in your school or school district who you choose to communicate with.

Affiliated Companies. For all users, we may share some or all of your information with our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us. For example, if you are a School Account Manager, Educator, Parent, or Student, we may share information with affiliates who act to support the provision of Services to particular schools or organizations.

Service Providers and Third Party Sharing. Like most companies, we work with third parties to help us provide our Services and to support our internal operations. In some cases, these third parties may use information subject to their own privacy policies and to comply with their own legal and regulatory obligations. We work with different types of third parties, presently including:

* Information hosting, storage, and cloud service providers
* Payment processing companies
* Security service providers
* Technical and customer support providers
* Analytics providers (though we generally do not permit analytics providers to utilize information for their own purposes with respect to Parents, Educators, or Students)
* Marketing and promotions providers (though we generally do not work with marketing and promotions providers on our own behalf with respect to Parents, Educators, or Students)

In general, we have contracts with our service providers that address their protection of information. We reserve the right to modify which particular third parties we work with at any time. We may update this Privacy Notice regarding such third parties. See the Updates to Our Privacy Notice section to learn how to become informed of these updates. Please note that we do not control and are not responsible for third parties that schools may choose to work with.

Professional Advisors, Law Enforcement, and Regulators. We may share your information with our professional advisors who provide legal, compliance, auditing, accounting, banking, consulting, or similar services, and with teachers, school districts, regulators, law enforcement, or government agencies to:

* Comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, including those compliance obligations of federal, state, or local regulators
* Protect our interests, property, or legal rights, or those of our customers or third parties
* Respond to a subpoena, court order, or similar law enforcement request, or when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of this Privacy Notice or other applicable terms
* For other legal purposes, such as to enforce our terms and conditions, or to exercise or defend legal claims

Corporate Transaction. In the event of a corporate transaction, we may share your personal information with companies or other entities in connection with, or during the negotiation of, any merger, sale of company stock or assets, financing, acquisition, restructuring, divestiture, or dissolution of all or a portion of our business, or other similar event.

Other Disclosures. In addition to the above disclosures, we may disclose personal information in the event that we believe such disclosure is (i) necessary to provide our services or operate our business; (ii) in accordance with purposes we describe when you share it with us; (iii) permitted by law; or (iv) at your direction.

If you are a Visitor on our General Website, we may share your information with advertisers, ad networks, and other promotional partners.

**What Choices Do I Have?**

Update personal information. If you are an Educator or School Administrator, you can update certain information that you have provided by logging into your account. As permitted by law, we may not accommodate a request to change or delete information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement, cause the information to be incorrect, or prevent the provision of our Services.

If you are the Parent of a Student and would like to update your or their information as maintained by a particular school or organization that utilizes our Services, please contact that school or organization directly to do so.

Marketing and Other Communications. If you are a Visitor or School Administrator, or if you have expressly consented, you may receive marketing communications from SchoolStatus. We do not target marketing communications to Parents or Students. You may opt out of receiving marketing emails from us by following the unsubscribe link in each email. Please note that you may continue to receive non-marketing emails from us after you opt-out. If you are a Parent or Student, you may receive messages from Educators through our platform. They, and not we, are responsible for such messaging.

Cookies. You have a number of choices regarding certain cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may modify your browser’s settings to notify you of cookie placement or decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of our website may not function properly or at all as a result.

Other Rights. You may have additional rights—such as rights to access or delete your personal information—if you are a resident of certain states. Please see the additional notices for residents of California, Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, and Texas.

**Updates to Our Privacy Notice**

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in order to provide clarification or notice of changes to our practices. If we make changes, we will revise the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Notice. Changes to this Privacy Notice will be effective once they are posted unless otherwise indicated.
