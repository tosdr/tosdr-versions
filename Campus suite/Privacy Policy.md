SchoolNow™ Privacy Policy
=========================

![Ferpa](https://www.schoolnow.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SchoolNow/Social%20Images/Ferpa.png?width=236&height=236&name=Ferpa.png)

SchoolNow™ collects some Personal Data from its Users and this Statement governs all the services that we provide directly to you. Whether you are browsing our websites, receiving our newsletters, or using our SchoolNow™ products and services. We take your privacy seriously so please take the time to review how we collect and use your information. By accessing or using the Service, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of your information as described below. 

Additionally, this Statement governs the use of personal information for all our products and services that we provide directly to you as a so-called ‘data controller.’

What personal information we collect and how we use it will depend on your relationship with SchoolNow.  The following section is mainly for informational purposes and describes how your information is generally used when we provide products and services to you on behalf of a client. How your information is used depends on your institution, so you should read your institution’s privacy statement.

### Student Submitted Information within Schools

Prior to a student submitting any information within a School environment by accessing SchoolNow for the purpose of using the notification system, publishing any Student Personal Identifiable Information (PII) on district/school-sponsored website as well as the social media integration, the Teacher must certify that they have received the appropriate consent by either: a) choosing to act as the agent of the Parent and consent on the Parents behalf which is commonly referred to as School Consent, or b) collect the parental consent directly from the parent.

The first and simplest way is for teachers to agree to act as the parent's agent, and provide consent on their behalf to use SchoolNow solely in the educational context. This form is commonly referred to as "school consent". Under this type of consent, no Student PII or related content submitted by students will be shown publicly, unless parents give additional parental consent to School. Teachers, Staff or IT Administrators should not be publishing any Student PII without the appropriate parental consent.

### Types of Data collected

Among the types of Personal Data that this Application collects, by itself or through third parties, there are: Cookies; Usage Data.

Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided below, and in the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection. Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically when using this Application.

For the purposes of sending notifications to parents, school staff, students and administrators, we receive the following PII from the school’s SIS system. Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases where this Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.

PII data collected: First name, last name, email address, phone number, password and gender.

Other data collected: Language, country, grades

Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.

Users logging into the platform are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through the platform and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.

SchoolNow outsources some development of our software to a trusted third party for the purpose of processing the contact information coming from a school’s SIS and normalizing it into our system for email, text and voice communications. In this case, we have a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement in place that includes our expectations of data handling, security and privacy.

SchoolNow allows end-users to change, at any time, email addresses and phone numbers that have been synchronized to us from the school. To change this personal information, log into the parent portal, review the information, and make the appropriate changes. This will result in an automatic notice sent to the school asking them to update the information in their SIS, Active Directory or system that is synchronizing data to us so that the proper contact information is correctly sent to us during the next synchronization.

### Mode and place of processing the Data

#### Methods of processing

The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.

The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT-enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.

If SchoolNow becomes aware of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party or that any user data was used for an unauthorized purpose, we will comply with relevant state and other data breach laws. We will notify users of any breach resulting in unauthorized release of data electronically, at minimum, and without unreasonable delay so that you can take appropriate steps. The notification will include: date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach, general description of what occurred, and steps SchoolNow is taking to address the breach.

#### Legal basis of processing

The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:

* Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations, the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
* provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
* processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
* processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
* processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

#### Requests to Review, Change or Remove Personal Data

Data is synchronized one-way from the school to SchoolNow in order for us to provide notifications services. Any party seeking access to their personal information stored by SchoolNow can make a request to the school sharing the data. 

SchoolNow allows end-users to change, at any time, email addresses and phone numbers that have been synchronized to us from the school. To change this personal information, log into the parent portal, review the information, and make the appropriate changes. This will result in an automatic notice sent to the school asking them to update the information in their SIS, Active Directory or system that is synchronizing data to us so that the proper contact information is correctly sent to us during the next synchronization.

Student information may be visible during Customer Support and/or troubleshooting. Personally identifiable information such as Student Name, Student Email Address, login dates and times could be viewed by SchoolNow Product Support Staff.

Educators can delete an account at your request by contacting them directly. When they delete your account, that information will not sync over during the next synchronization process, and the data in SchoolNow will be deleted. Please note that some content may not be deleted given various compliance and recordkeeping obligations schools have. Please contact your (or your child’s) school if you would like this content deleted.
