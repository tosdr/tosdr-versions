Ting Internet Terms of Service
==============================

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to your use of Ting Internet (“Service”) and any equipment or devices needed to deliver that service (“Devices”). The Service and Devices are provided by Ting Fiber, LLC, or one of its subsidiaries.\*

By applying for, ordering, or using the Service, you accept these Terms. You must be at least 18 years old and can enter into a legal agreement for yourself, and anyone at the premises served. Accepting these Terms does not guarantee that Ting will install or provide the Service to you.

Please read these terms and conditions carefully. They contain limitation of liability and mandatory arbitration clauses and prohibit you from bringing or participating in class arbitrations.

Changes to the Terms
--------------------

We may change these Terms or our prices at any time. Unless prohibited by law, we may also modify or cancel your service or account or take corrective actions if you violate any part of these Terms. You should regularly check our website (ting.com/internet) for the most current version of the Terms.

Service Description
-------------------

Ting provides high-speed fiber Internet for residential and business use at a single location. The Service is intended for customary usage for one household or business at a time and may not be shared across multiple units (e.g., apartments or offices). Please contact us directly if you need services for multiple units or larger buildings. Business customers must purchase a business account and are still subject to these Terms of Service. Construction, installation, service, and other fees may be higher for business users. Individuals who sign up on behalf of a business represent and warrant that they have authority to bind such business to these Terms of Service.  

Additional services, such as static IP addresses, may be available for an extra cost. Contact us to discuss these options.  

Installation
------------

We need access to your property to install Ting Internet, which may include installing Devices both inside and outside and possibly using underground conduits or existing wiring. We may take photographs of the Devices and surrounding area for quality control purposes. You agree that our technicians may need to drill holes in any structure on the premises in addition to  using existing facilities on your property to complete the installation.

If you rent or do not own the property, you must obtain permission from the property owner before installation. You may be required to provide written evidence of this permission. If you fail to get the necessary permissions and the property owner takes legal action against Ting, you agree to reimburse Ting for any costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, damages, and the cost to de-install, which are incurred by Ting because you did not have the necessary permissions..

You are responsible for notifying us of any obstacles (like underground sprinkler systems or invisible fences) that might affect the installation. If we need to move our equipment due to your actions, omissions, or requests, you will be responsible for covering those costs. While we typically do not charge for standard installations, we reserve the right to charge additional fees in special circumstances.

Devices
-------

Devices provided by Ting remain the property of Ting or its successors. You allow Ting to enter your property to perform maintenance or upgrades or remove the Devices when your service ends. You are responsible for the Devices while they are on your property and must pay for any damaged, lost, or stolen devices, regardless of fault. Some Devices may come with separate terms and conditions. Some Devices, such as Whole Home WiFi, involve separate terms and conditions. Ting is not responsible for and will not compensate you for any device owned by you that is used in connection with the Services.  

Billing and Payment
-------------------

Service prices do not include taxes, government fees, surcharges, or other regulatory fees, which will be added to your bill. You agree to pay for the Service, including any fees and taxes, before each billing cycle. Ting only accepts payments by credit card, debit card, or ACH; checks are not accepted. Any unpaid amounts will incur interest at the lower of 2.5% or the maximum rate allowed by law.

If you believe your bill contains an error, you must notify us within 30 days of receiving the bill. If you do not notify us within thirty (30) days of the date you receive your bill, you waive any right to dispute the charge, including in arbitration or a court proceeding.  If a payment method is denied or a chargeback occurs, we may suspend your service until payment is received. Repeated payment issues may result in additional actions, including requiring prepayment for continued service.  If we determine that the disputed charge was inappropriate and was raised by you in a timely manner, we will credit, refund, or provide other compensation to you. If we credit, refund, or provide other compensation to you to settle a disputed charge, you agree that the dispute is fully and finally resolved

Acceptable Use Policy
---------------------

You agree not to use the Service for any illegal, fraudulent, or abusive activities, as determined by Ting. You may not use the Service to harass, threaten, or defame any individual or entity or to interfere with another customer's use of the Service or our infrastructure. You are responsible for all activity on your account.  

Examples of prohibited activities include but are not limited to:

* Sending spam or unsolicited messages.
* Engaging in illegal activities such as terrorism, threats, fraud, or advocacy of violence.
* Distributing malware or engaging in phishing.
* Reselling the Service or operating servers for commercial purposes.
* Violating copyright laws.

Ting reserves the right to suspend or terminate your service with or without if Ting determines, in its sole discretion, that you may have violated or are likely to violate these Terms. You are responsible for all activity on the Services under your account, even if you did not undertake the activity yourself.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act
--------------------------------

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA” found at 17 U.S.C. § 512) provides that owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed may report alleged infringements (“Notification”) to service providers. Once such a Notification is received, service providers automatically have certain obligations. Accordingly, in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, Ting maintains a policy that provides for the termination of the Services, under appropriate circumstances, if customers are using the Services for repeat infringements. In addition, Ting does not waive any other remedy it may have against customers for copyright infringement.  

##### DMCA Copyright Notifications:

If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and you believe that your rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed, you may submit a Notification pursuant to the DMCA to the address listed in the first paragraph of these terms and conditions or via email to dmca@ting.com. Please include: i) a signature (electronic is fine) of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the intellectual property allegedly infringed; ii) identification of the copyrighted work(s); iii) contact information; iv) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner and violates their intellectual property rights; and v) a statement that the information in the notification is complete and accurate to the best of the complaining party’s knowledge. False notices are bad for everyone, and anyone who makes a false notice may subject themselves to substantial penalties.

Privacy and Use of Your Information
-----------------------------------

By accepting these Terms, you also agree to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and share your data. This policy is available on our website and may change over time.  

Cooperation with Law Enforcement
--------------------------------

Ting will cooperate with law enforcement if required by law. We may disclose your information if properly requested. When possible, we will attempt to notify you beforehand, but this may not always be allowed or practical.  

Website Use
-----------

You may use our website to manage your account, make payments, view content, and learn more about our services and devices. Use of the website is subject to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.  

Dispute Resolution
------------------

If a disagreement arises, we agree to try to resolve it by discussing it first. If the issue is not resolved within 90 days, any claim or dispute will be settled by binding arbitration. If we are unable to resolve an issue within 90 days after first contact about that issue, we each agree that, except as provided below, any and all claims or disputes (whether in contract, tory, or otherwise, whether pre-existing, present, or future, and including statutory consumer protection, common law, intentional tort, injunctive, or equitable claims) in any way related to or concerning these terms of service, our services, devices, or products, including any billing disputes, will be resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these terms of service.  Please contact us with any dispute by contacting us along with a description of the problem, all relevant documents and information as well as your proposed resolution. We will contact you at the email address or phone number that we have on file for you or by mail to your service address. You agree that you may bring claims against Ting only in an individual capacity, not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative. You may elect to pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration if you provide us with written notice of your intention to do so within 60 days of your acceptance of these Terms. The arbitration or small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy.  

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

You agree that we and our business partners are not liable to you or any third party for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits (regardless of whether we have been notified that such loss may occur) by reason of any act or omission in our provision of products or services or under any legal theory, including fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, personal injury, product liability, or any other theory. We assume no risk or responsibility for your use of any of our services or devices. We are not liable for (1) any act or omission of any other company furnishing a part of our service or any devices provided for such service; (2) errors or omissions of our business partners; (3) any damages that result from any product or service provided by or manufactured by third parties; or (4) any unauthorized or disputed charges for our services that appeared more than 30 days earlier on your online account statement which you did not promptly dispute in accordance with the terms of service. You acknowledge that no fiduciary or other special relationship exists between you and us, either by virtue of the terms of service or your use of our services and devices, or otherwise. Unless prohibited by law, you agree that in no event will Ting be liable for damages or other monetary relief in any more than what you paid to Ting over the last year.  

Warranties
----------

Ting provides the services on an “as-is” and “as available” basis without warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied, regarding the products and services provided hereunder or any software used in connection therewith, including but not limited to, and to the extent permitted by law, warranty or title, merchantability, fitness for a particular use, quality, non-infringement, performance, or accuracy. We expressly disclaim any and all implied warranties. We do not promise error-free or uninterrupted service and do not authorize anyone to make warranties on our behalf. In no event will Ting be liable for damages of any kind arising out of or related to your inability to use the services or any third-party services, including E911 or any monitoring (security, medical, etc.,), whether or not Ting was negligent. The services should not be used in life support devices or other critical systems.  

Indemnification
---------------

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ting, its affiliates, and each of their respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, successors and assigns from and against any and all liabilities, settlements, penalties, claims, causes of action, and demands brought by third parties (including any costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees on account thereof) resulting from your use of Ting Services or Devices, or use of the Services or Devices by another person using your account.  

Notices and Communications
--------------------------

You may notify us by electronic means via our website. Notices will be considered effective after we receive them. We may provide notices, communications, or disclosures to you via electronic means including by posting to your online Ting account, our own website, via email to the email address(es) associated with your account, text message, mobile application, invoice, or otherwise communicating them to you via your Internet services. In order to access these communications electronically, you will need access to the Internet, a valid email address, access to a computer or other device that includes 128-bit encryption and up to date browser software, and software that allows you to read PDF files. You consent to calls or text messages from us or a third party on our behalf to any telephone number that we provide to you or that we issue to you and understand that such calls or texts may be delivered using artificial or prerecorded messages. You can receive paper copies of these terms and conditions by contacting our customer care department.  

Termination
-----------

You can cancel your service at any time. Service will continue until the end of the current billing cycle, and refunds will not be prorated. Ting reserves the right to terminate your service anytime for any reason.  

Content, Security, and Applications
