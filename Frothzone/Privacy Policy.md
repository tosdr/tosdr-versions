Data collected by Bibliogram
----------------------------

Bibliogram logs all incoming request URLs and the time of the request to the console, but does not log headers, IP addresses, or other information. These logs are not stored on disk.

Bibliogram has a database that stores the usernames and IDs of viewed users, and all data about viewed posts. This data is not linked with the user that requested it.

Data collected by Caddy
-----------------------

This server uses caddy as a reverse proxy to Bibliogram. Caddy logs nothing by default, and this setting is not altered, so no information is logged.

Sending data
------------

Data collected by Bibliogram is not public and is never sent to any external services.

Exporting or deleting your data
-------------------------------

Since Bibliogram does not associate any data with a user identifier, we cannot export or delete "your" data since we have no concept of "you".
