Privacy policy
==============

Last updated: 3 July 2024

About this policy
-----------------

The [_Privacy Act 1988_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2022C00361)(Privacy Act) requires entities bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) to have a privacy policy. This privacy policy outlines the personal information handling practices of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). The OAIC also has a [summary privacy policy](https://www.oaic.gov.au/_old/about-us/our-corporate-information/key-documents/privacy-policy-summary).

This policy is written in simple language. The legal obligations of the OAIC as an Australian Government agency in respect of collecting and handling personal information are outlined in the Privacy Act and, in particular in the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), found in Schedule 1 of that Act. The OAIC as an Australian Government agency, also has privacy obligations under the Privacy (Australian Government Agencies – Governance) APP Code 2017 (the Privacy Code).

The OAIC will update this privacy policy when its information handling practices change. Updates will be publicised on the OAIC website and to staff through its ‘all staff’ email communications.

### Collection of your personal information

The OAIC aims to only collect the personal or sensitive information it requires to carry out its powers, functions, and duties in any given instance.

The main way the OAIC collects personal information about you is when you provide it. For example, the OAIC collects personal information such as contact details, when you make a complaint or request an Information Commissioner (IC) review,  make an information access request or a data breach notification,  respond to a survey response, or make a job vacancy application or lodge a report.:

* contact the OAIC to ask for information;
* make a complaint about a privacy breach to the OAIC;
* make a complaint about the way an agency has handled an FOI request or seek a review of an FOI;
* make a complaint about the way an entity has handled your CDR data under the CDR scheme;
* ask for access to information the OAIC holds about you or other information about the OAIC’s operation;
* notify the OAIC about a data breach;
* complete an OAIC survey;
* apply for a job vacancy at the OAIC; or
* report a matter for investigation.

The OAIC may also collect information from you when it investigates or reviews a privacy, FOI or CDR matter.

### Indirect collection

The OAIC may collect personal information about you, including sensitive information, indirectly from publicly available sources or from third parties such as:

* your authorised representative, if you have one;
* applicants, complainants, respondents to a complaint, investigation, application or data breach notification or the third parties’ employees and witnesses; or
* other government agencies, including State or Territory authorities, and alternative complaint bodies, where information sharing is permitted.

The OAIC would ordinarily collect your personal information in this way to, for example:

* handle a complaint, data breach notification, review or investigation; or
* contact stakeholders who may be interested in the work of the OAIC or participating in OAIC consultations.

The OAIC collects information about your interactions with the OAIC website using cookies.

Information collected about your interactions with the OAIC website via cookies is used by the OAIC to improve your website user experience.

### Secondary purpose uses

The OAIC may, in certain circumstances, use your personal and sensitive information for a different purpose to that for which it was collected.

One secondary use of your personal information by the OAIC is report generation by way of the OAIC Data Warehouse.

The OAIC Data Warehouse is part of the OAIC business intelligence system, which is a technology-driven framework that analyses data for the purposes of delivering actionable reports and information to help executives make informed decisions. It draws information, including personal information, from the OAIC’s various information repositories to a single database and arranges the information in such a way that it is readily usable for several business intelligence functions, including the creation of internal reports and internal alerts. and external reports.

### Internal reports

Internal reports usually utilise case attributes (e.g. type of interaction, date of interaction being made and date of interaction being resolved) about your interactions with the OAIC (e.g. making a report or enquiry) to produce statistical reports about how the OAIC operates. These reports are usually then used for business improvement.

### Internal alerts

Where appropriate, the OAIC may use personal information it holds to generate internal alerts using the OAIC Data Warehouse and its business intelligence system. These alerts may take a number of forms, including text messages to staff phones and emails, however they are ordinarily generated for staff safety. The alerts may concern notifications on office closure, Information and Communications Technology power outages, office evacuations, and health and safety concerns.

### Use of sensitive information

Sometimes the OAIC may need to use your sensitive information. The OAIC will generally only use your sensitive information with your consent.

There are some limited exceptions that permit use of sensitive information for a secondary purpose without your consent, including where it is required or authorised by or under law., or where a permitted general situation exists, like where the entity reasonably believes that the use is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of an individual or the public.

Disclosure
----------

The OAIC discloses personal information for purposes other than the purpose for which personal information was collected in certain circumstances. These include:

* where you have provided consent to disclosure for a secondary purpose
* where the secondary disclosure of your personal information is authorised or required by or under law
* where you would reasonably expect the OAIC to use it for that secondary purpose, and the information is related to the primary purpose of collection or, in the case of sensitive information, directly related to the primary purpose
* where a permitted general situation exists in relation to the use or disclosure of the information by the OAIC
* where the OAIC believes the secondary disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcement-related activities
* to participate in merit or judicial review proceedings in tribunals or courts or to institute proceedings in courts
* where the information is biometric information, or biometric templates, to be disclosed to an enforcement body in accordance with guidelines made by the Information Commissioner for these purposes.

Disclosure as required or authorised by law
-------------------------------------------

### External reporting

The OAIC is required by law to produce certain external reports, usually for government oversight of its activities. The OAIC may use your personal information to generate these reports, usually by way of the OAIC Data Warehouse and its business intelligence system, however, your personal information will be in the form of either aggregated data that does not identify you or will be de-identified before release of such reports.

### Statutory information sharing

Under the Privacy Act the OAIC may share your personal information in certain circumstances where it has acquired your personal information in the course of exercising powers or performing functions or duties under the Privacy Act (e.g., in response to a request for information under section 44 of the Privacy Act).

The OAIC may share information or documents containing your personal information with another entity (a receiving body) under section 33A of that Act if certain conditions are met. These conditions include where:

* sharing is for the purpose of the OAIC exercising powers, or performing functions or duties under the Privacy Act or for the purpose of the receiving body exercising its powers, or performing its functions or duties; and
* OAIC is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the receiving body has satisfactory arrangements in place for protecting the information or documents.

Sharing under section 33A may occur where the OAIC holds information, including personal information, which could assist another regulatory body in conducting an investigation in the course of performing its functions.

Subject to certain mandatory considerations, the OAIC may share information or documents containing your personal information with other entities or the public under section 33B of that Act if it is in the public interest to do so.

### Complaints and reviews

If you make a privacy, FOI, or CDR complaint, or apply for an FOI IC review, the OAIC will usually give a copy of the complaint or application to the respondent and, where relevant, affected third parties, in circumstances where a requirement to afford procedural fairness arises.

### Data breach notifications

If you notify the OAIC about a data breach then the OAIC will not disclose personal information about you provided to it via that notification unless you agree, or would reasonably expect,  the OAIC to do so. If the breach relates to the My Health Records Act, the OAIC may disclose your personal information to the My Health Records System Operator under section 73A of that Act.

### Review of OAIC decisions

The OAIC may disclose personal information to another review body, if a complainant, applicant or respondent seeks an external review of the OAIC’s decision or makes a complaint about the OAIC’s practices, for example the Commonwealth Ombudsman, or the Australian Human Rights Commission.

### Publication of decisions and reports

Generally, when the OAIC publishes decisions, determinations or reports (on the OAIC website and on the [Australasian Legal Information Institute website](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr)) if you are a party who is an individual then the OAIC will not publish your name unless you ask for it to be published.

The OAIC may also publish other information about cases that it has resolved without a formal decision.

### Disclosure to the media

Subject to any circumstances under which the OAIC may disclose information in accordance with its information sharing powers, the OAIC generally only provides the media with personal information relating to a complaint if you have agreed for it to do so.

### CDR and EDR schemes

As part of the OAIC’s CDR functions, the OAIC may disclose personal information contained in enquiries or complaints to the ACCC in its capacity as a co-regulator of the CDR Scheme under section 50 of the Privacy Act.

The OAIC may also transfer CDR complaints directly to EDR schemes in accordance with that section. The OAIC will notify you where  this occurs.

### Disclosure of personal information overseas

Generally, the OAIC only discloses personal information overseas so that it can properly handle a complaint or application. For example, if:

* the complainant or respondent to a complaint is based overseas;
* an Australian-based respondent is a related body corporate to an overseas company;
* you have complained to an overseas entity and the OAIC about the same or a related matter; or
* the OAIC decides to exercise its statutory information sharing powers with an overseas entity.

When you communicate with the OAIC through a social network service such as Facebook or Twitter, the social network provider and its partners may collect and hold your personal information overseas.

Certain tools, such as Google Analytics and Google reCAPTCHA will require data collected by these tools to be sent overseas and stored on Google’s servers. [Google’s Cloud Data Processing Addendum](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum) provides that when collecting, using and storing data, it will comply with applicable laws, including Australian privacy laws.

### Disclosure of sensitive information

Sometimes the OAIC may need to disclose your sensitive information. The OAIC will generally only disclose your sensitive information with your consent.

There are some limited exceptions that permit disclosure of sensitive information for a secondary purpose without your consent, including where it is required or authorised by or under law, or where a permitted general situation exists, like where the entity reasonably believes that the disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of an individual or the public

Quality of personal information
-------------------------------

To ensure that the personal information the OAIC collects is accurate, up-to-date and complete, the OAIC:

* records information in a consistent format;
* where necessary, confirms the accuracy of information its collects from a third party or a public source;
* promptly adds updated or new personal information to existing records; and
* audits its contact lists to check their accuracy from time to time and where necessary.

The OAIC also reviews the quality of personal information before it uses or discloses it

Storage and security of personal information
--------------------------------------------

### General storage and security

All personal information collected digitally by the OAIC is held on servers located in Australia. The OAIC retains effective control over any personal information held on those servers.

Some data collected by tools such as Google Analytics and Google reCAPTCHA will be stored in cloud-based servers located across North America, Europe, South America and Asia . Data may be de-identified and anonymised so that individuals cannot be identified or re-identified from the data, before such data is sent overseas for storage. When data is not de-identified or anonymised, it will be stored and handled in a way that complies with Australian privacy laws.

Hard copy documents are generally held on site, in a mixture of tambours, locked cabinets, and safes, depending on the nature of the document.

### OAIC information technology security practices

Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) provides information technology services to the OAIC, including the provision of servers on which the OAIC stores much of the personal information it holds.

In providing information technology services to the OAIC, DEWR as well as the OAIC must comply with mandatory security policies which set out the Australian Government’s requirements for protective security and information security practices across government.

For the list of mandatory requirements that cover governance, personnel, information and physical security, please visit the [Protective Security Policy Framework website](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/governance/Pages/default.aspx).

### Reasonable steps to protect personal information

In addition to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) security and physical security measures,  the OAIC takes reasonable steps to protect the security of the personal information it holds from both internal and external threats through access security and monitoring controls, including :

* regularly assessing the risk of misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure of that information;
* taking measures to address those risks, for example, by keeping a record (audit trail) of when someone has added, changed or deleted personal information held in the OAIC’s electronic databases and regularly checking that staff only access those records they are permitted to and  when they need to; and
* conducting regular internal and external audits to assess whether the OAIC has adequately complied with or implemented these measures;
* by implementing and regularly updating the OAIC’s data breach response plan to ensure that the OAIC meets its obligations under the notifiable data breach (NDB) scheme under the Privacy Act; and
* by undertaking privacy impact assessments when information handling practices change, or new practices are introduced.

The OAIC is required to maintain a Privacy Impact Assessment Register in accordance with section 15(1) of the Privacy Code. These privacy impact assessments, as well as the OAIC’s privacy threshold assessments can be found on the OAIC’s PIA Register [here](https://www.oaic.gov.au/about-the-OAIC/access-our-information/our-privacy-impact-assessment-register).

### Destruction/deletion of personal information

The OAIC destroys personal information in a secure manner or takes steps to de-identify personal information it holds when it is no longer needed and when it is lawfully authorised or required to do so.

The storage of personal information held by the OAIC which is contained in a Commonwealth record is subject to the requirements of _the_ [_Archives Act 1983_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2023C00281), the OAIC’s Records Disposal Authority and the OAIC’s normal administrative practice (NAP). For example, the OAIC generally destroys complaint records after three years, in accordance with the [OAIC’s Records Disposal Authority](https://www.naa.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-12/agency-ra-2012-00305243.pdf)  .

### Human resources information

The OAIC stores personal information collected or created for human resources purposes (human resources information,) including:

* job application information
* information it generates about staff performance
* pay, superannuation and tax information
* Australian Public Service (APS) Employment Database data for the APS Commission, and
* diversity information including, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, employment history information, code and investigation history and medical certificates.

The OAIC uses a SAP software solution provided by the Shared Delivery Office (SDO) and hosted on DEWR servers within Australia. The SDO is part of the Department of Finance (DOF).

The OAIC has entered memorandums of understanding with both DEWR and DOF to ensure it maintains control of and secures human resources information stored under this arrangement.

### Accessing and correcting your personal information

Under APPs 12 and 13, you have the right to ask for access to personal information that the OAIC holds about you, and to ask that it is corrected. You can ask for access or correction by contacting the OAIC. Once contacted, the OAIC must respond to you in relation to your request within 30 days. The OAIC will aim to make its decision about your request as soon as practicable.

If you ask, the OAIC must give you access to your personal information and take reasonable steps to correct it if the OAIC considers it is incorrect, unless there is a law that allows or authorises or requires the OAIC not to.

Upon a request for access or correction being made, the OAIC will ask you to verify your identity before it gives you access to your information or the ability to correct it. The OAIC aims to make the process as simple as possible. If the OAIC refuses your access or correction request, it must notify you in writing setting out its reasons for doing so.

The steps appropriate to verify an individual’s identity will depend on the circumstances. The OAIC will seek the minimum amount of personal information needed to establish an individual’s identity. For example, during a telephone contact it may be adequate for the OAIC to request information like your name and date of birth for that information to be checked against its records.

If the OAIC makes a correction about information it has already disclosed to others, you can ask the OAIC to tell them about the correction. The OAIC must do so unless there is a valid reason not to.

If the OAIC refuses to correct your personal information, you can ask it to associate (for example, attach or link) a statement with your personal information,  to the effect that you believe the information is incorrect and why.

You may follow the above process if you wish to access or correct personal information about you collected by third party providers, such as Google through use of the reCAPTACHA tool, by sending a request to the OAIC.

You also have the right under the FOI Act to request access to documents that the OAIC holds and ask for information that the OAIC holds about you to be changed or annotated if it is incomplete, incorrect, out-of- date or misleading. For further information see the [Access the OAIC information](https://www.oaic.gov.au/_old/about-us/access-our-information) page on the OAIC website or see the [OAIC contact details](https://www.oaic.gov.au/contact-us) below

How to make a complaint
-----------------------

If you wish to complain to the OAIC about how it has handled your personal information you should first complain to the OAIC in writing. If you need help lodging a complaint, you can [contact the OAIC](https://www.oaic.gov.au/contact-us) for assistance  - see ‘How to contact the OAIC’ below.

If the OAIC receives a complaint from you about how it has handled your personal information, the OAIC will determine what (if any) should be taken to resolve the complaint.

If the OAIC decides that a complaint should be investigated further, the complaint will usually be handled by a more senior officer than the officer whose actions you are complaining about.

The OAIC will assess and handle complaints about the conduct of an OAIC officer using the [APS Values](http://www.apsc.gov.au/working-in-the-aps/your-rights-and-responsibilities-as-an-aps-employee/aps-values), [Code of Conduct](http://www.apsc.gov.au/working-in-the-aps/your-rights-and-responsibilities-as-an-aps-employee/code-of-conduct) and the [guidelines issued by the Australian Public Service Commission](http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/handling-misconduct-a-human-resource-managers-guide-2015).

If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of the complaint or the way in which the complaint was handled, then you may contact the Commonwealth Ombudsman [https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/)for advice about your complaint, or [lodge a complaint](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-complaints/lodge-a-privacy-complaint-with-us) under s 36 of the Privacy Act to the regulatory arm of the OAIC, to complain about the OAIC’s information handling practices as an agency.
