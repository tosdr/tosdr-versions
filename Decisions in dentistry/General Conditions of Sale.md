With an aging population and more patients retaining their natural teeth later in life, you may want to pay particular attention to the article “Preserve Natural Teeth With Biomimetic Dentistry.” It dives into how preserving tooth vitality, natural biomechanics, and long-term function are meeting the demand for a minimally invasive approach. Learn how selective caries removal, maximizing adhesion, and using biomechanically compatible materials are helping clinicians extend the lifespan of teeth while minimizing invasive techniques like full-coverage crowns.
