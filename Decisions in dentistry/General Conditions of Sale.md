[In this episode of The Art of Dental Finance and M ![In this episode of The Art of Dental Finance and Management,” Art is joined by Brannon Moncrief of McLerran & Associates to delve into the complexities of DSO transactions. Whether you’re contemplating a practice sale or simply curious about the intricacies of these deals, this conversation covers essential topics such as the tricks DSOs might try to pull and the importance of having a sell-side advisor at the table when navigating a sale.⁠
⁠
Brannon and Art also discuss the current state of the private equity and DSO world, offering insights into what to expect when investing and transitioning in the dental space. Brannon shares how you can make the best decisions for your practice during exit — and avoid leaving millions on the table — by understanding your “why” and finding a buyer who aligns with your goals. ⁠
