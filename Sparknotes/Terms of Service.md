SparkNotes Terms of Use
=======================

LAST UPDATED: April 7, 2022

SparkNotes LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Barnes & Noble Booksellers, Inc., (referred to herein as “SparkNotes,” “we,” or “us”) welcomes you (“you”), the user of the website. Please carefully read these Terms of Use (these “Terms”) because they govern your access and use of this website (“Site”) as well as any other online information, products and communications services, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Services”). You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all these Terms. These Terms are a legally binding contract between you and us. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

The Site and Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Site or our Services. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms prior to you using the Site or our Services.

**These Terms require the use of binding arbitration to resolve disputes rather than jury trials or class actions. Please see Section** 19 **for details, including instructions to follow in order to opt out of binding arbitration and the class action waiver.**

1. **Licenses and Restrictions** 

Provided that you are eligible to use the Site, we grant you a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Services and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly gained access solely for your personal, non-commercial use (unless You have a business relationship with us), strictly in accordance with these Terms.

2. **Acceptable use policy** 

You may not access or use the Services for any purpose other than that for which we make the Services available. The Services may not be used in connection with any commercial endeavors except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by us.

As a user of the Services, you agree not to:

* modify, download (other than page caching), reproduce, copy, or resell the Services, the Content or any portion or derivative thereof;
* commercially use the Services, the Content or any portion derivative thereof (unless you have a business relationship with us);
* copy or download any user’s account or profile information for the benefit of any third party;
* enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that apply to the Services or their systems, the Content or any portion or derivative thereof;
* use any robot, spider, data miner, crawler, scraper or other automated means to access or index the Site, the Services or their systems, the Content or any portion or derivative thereof for any purpose;
* interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services;
* bypass any security measures used by us to prevent or restrict access to any portion of the Services, the Content or any portion or derivative thereof;
* frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of ours;
* use the SparkNotes name, trademarks, services marks or logos in any meta tags or any other “hidden text”;
* Upload or transmit (or attempt to upload or to transmit) viruses, Trojan horses, or other material, including excessive use of capital letters and spamming (continuous posting of repetitive text), that interferes with any party’s uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the Services or modifies, impairs, disrupts, alters, or interferes with the use, features, functions, operation, or maintenance of the Services;
* compile, repackage, disseminate or otherwise use data extracted from the Services; or
* Use the Services in a manner inconsistent with any applicable laws or regulations.

By using the Services you agree to our acceptable use policy (“Acceptable Use Policy”) outlined above. Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy or any portion of these Terms may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or other restrictions. We may terminate your access to the Services if we suspect or believe you are violating this Acceptable Use Policy, even if it results that our suspicion was not well founded.

3. **Your Privacy**

For information about how we collect, use, share and otherwise process information about you, please see our Privacy Policy [https://bn.clarip.com/privacycenter/?brand=barnesandnoble](https://bn.clarip.com/privacycenter/?brand=barnesandnoble). Further, we do not knowingly accept, request, or solicit information from children or knowingly market to children under the age of 16. Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other state laws, if we receive actual knowledge that anyone under the age of 16 has provided personal information to us without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from the Services as quickly as is reasonably practical.

4. **Account registration**

If the Services require you to open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing us with current, complete and accurate information required by the applicable registration form. You are responsible for (i) keeping your account password confidential and secured, and (ii) avoiding unauthorized access your computer. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account and in no event will we be liable for the unauthorized use or misuse of your password.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof).

5. **Subscription Services**

**Subscription Fees**. For registered accounts with a subscription plan to any portion of the Services (“Subscription”), you agree to pay the subscription fees set forth when you register for the subscription (“Subscription Fees”). All Subscription Fees are payable in advance prior to the commencement of your subscription term.  

**Renewal**. Subscriptions will automatically renew for additional one month or one-year periods, respectively, unless you cancel by contacting us at [custserv@bn.com](mailto:custserv@bn.com) or by de-selecting “Auto-renew” in the Subscriptions and Billings page [https://www.sparknotes.com/plus/my-account/#billing-details](#billing-details) of your account on the Services, in which case your Subscription will not renew and we will not charge you any additional Subscription Fees. The pricing during any automatic renewal term will be the same as that during the immediately prior term unless we have given you written notice of a pricing increase at least sixty (60) days before the end of that prior term, in which case the pricing increase will be effective upon renewal and thereafter. You may view your current Subscription plan, subscription term and billing information at any time in your account settings.

**Cancellation of Subscription**. If you terminate your Subscription, you may use your Subscription until the end of the then-current subscription term and your Subscription will not be renewed after that period expires. However, you won’t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Subscription Fees paid for the then-current subscription term, subject to specific cancellation and refund rights listed below.

**Suspension/Termination by Us**. We may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Subscription, without notice if: (a) your payment is overdue (provided that we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the overdue payment before we terminate or suspend); (b) you provide false or inaccurate information; (c) you violate these Terms; or (d) you engage in conduct that is a violation of any applicable law (including, without limitation, copyright and intellectual property laws).

If we terminate or suspend your Subscription, your license to use any digital content provided in connection with the Subscription is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your Subscription is terminated, we have the right to immediately delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges up to and including the date of termination. Should you wish to resume your Subscription after any suspension, a restoration of service fee may apply. This fee is in addition to all past due unpaid charges and other fees.

**Billing Information**. Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the subscriptions to the Services are billed and processed by our third-party payment agent, Stripe. By using the Services, you also agree to Stripe’s Terms of Service [https://stripe.com/legal](https://stripe.com/legal) and their policies which can be found on their website. Stripe is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of SparkNotes and shall not be construed to be providing the applicable subscription to the Services. When you sign up for a subscription, you will be asked to provide your credit card information. You hereby authorize Stripe to bill your credit card in advance for your Subscription Fees and annually thereafter until your subscription to the Services terminates, and you further agree to pay any Subscription Fees so incurred. You agree to promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. Stripe manages credit card processing and is not permitted to store, retain or use your billing information except to process your credit card information. If we cannot charge your credit card for any fees when due because your payment information is no longer valid and up-to-date, or if we do not receive your payment when due through the alternative payment method you have selected, we may, at our election: (a) suspend your access to the portion of the Services provided on a subscription basis, in which case you will be responsible for all Subscription Fees incurred during the period of suspension, or (b) without waiving our rights to suspend or terminate your account, allow you a longer period during which to make payment, in which case you will remain responsible for all Subscription Fees incurred while we await your payment. Late payments incur interest charges at the rate of 1% per month on any outstanding balance or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less. The fees hereunder do not include any local, state or federal taxes or duties for transactions arising hereunder. If we are responsible for collecting such taxes based on the transactions under these Terms, you will be responsible for payment of all such taxes or duties, excluding taxes based on SparkNotes’ net income or property.
