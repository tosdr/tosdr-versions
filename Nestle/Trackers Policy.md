How Nestlé uses cookies and other tracking technology

This cookie notice applies to all Nestlé websites and mobile applications ("Nestlé Sites").

1\. What are cookies?
---------------------

Cookies are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. They are used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.

We use the term "cookies" throughout this notice to also cover all similar technologies, such as web beacons SDK, log files, pixel tags.

2\. What types of cookies are used on Nestlé Sites?
---------------------------------------------------

You may see what cookies are used on this website by clicking on the Cookie Settings icon at the bottom left of the screen.

We use the following types of cookies on Nestlé Sites:

#### a) Strictly necessary cookies

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.

#### b) Functionality cookies

These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party service providers. Functionality cookies allow to remember your preferences when you navigate the site and use our features, such as registration, logging in, language, location, and product favorites. If you disable these cookies certain parts of the website will not function properly for you. When you are browsing on our sites, these cookies will remember your preferences (like your language or location), and other information you choose to provide to us, so we can help tailor your experience and make it more relevant and personal to you.

#### c) Performance cookies

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us measure and analyze how you use our websites, apps and mobile platforms, to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site to improve both its functionality and your experience.

#### d) Targeting cookies

These cookies are used to deliver ads relevant to you. They also limit the number of times that you see an ad and help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We may also use the information obtained via these cookies to serve you with advertising that may be of interest to you based on your past online behaviour. We may share this information with other parties, including our partners.

#### e) Social media cookies

These cookies are used by social media services added to our site to enable you to share content with your friends and networks e.g. by using a social media sharing button on a Nestle Site.
