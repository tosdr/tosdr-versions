Our [Privacy Notice](https://www.nestle.com/info/privacy/privacy-notice) applies to any personal data or material shared on this Website.

 

3\. Intellectual property
-------------------------

### 3.1. Content provided by Nestlé

All intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademarks, in materials published by or on behalf of Nestlé on the Website (e.g. text and images) are owned by Nestlé or its licensors.

You may reproduce extracts of the Website for your own private use (i.e. non-commercial use) provided that you keep intact and respect all intellectual property rights, including any copyright notice which may appear on such content (e.g. © 2023 Nestlé).

### 3.2. Content provided by You

You represent to Nestlé that you are either the author of the content that you contribute to this Website, or that you have the rights (ie: have been given permission by the rights holder) and are able to contribute such content (e.g. pictures, videos, music) to the Website.

You agree that such content will be treated as non-confidential and you grant Nestlé a royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use (including to disclose, reproduce, transmit, publish, or broadcast) the content you provide for purposes relating to its business.

Please note that Nestlé is free to decide whether or not to use this content and that Nestlé may already have developed similar content or have obtained such content from other sources, in which case all intellectual property rights in this content remains with Nestlé and its licensors.

### 3.3. Rules governing consumer ratings and review service

All content that you submit is accurate and is based upon your actual experience with the product being reviewed.

As a result, we invite you to carefully review the legal notices of such third party websites, including keeping yourself informed of any changes to them.

You may operate a third party website and wish to link to this Website. In this case, Nestlé does not object to such linking provided that you do not suggest in any way that you are affiliated with or endorsed by Nestlé.
