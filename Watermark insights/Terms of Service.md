**1\. THE SERVICES**

1.1 These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the Watermark Insights, LLC website, Watermark affiliates websites, and all related software, products and/or subscription services (collectively, the “Service”). These Terms apply to all end users of the Service (hereinafter, “you”). You may use the Service only in compliance with these Terms, any agreement entered into by your institution relating to the Service to the extent such terms do not conflict with these Terms, and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.

1.2 If your institution (“Organization”) has entered into a Organization Subscription Agreement (“OSA”) with Watermark relating to the Service, Watermark agrees that Organization and its employees shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the OSA and therefore Watermark waives compliance by Organization and its employees with any conflicting provisions herein. Nothing in these Terms supersedes or limits your rights under the terms and conditions of any written agreement you have entered into with Watermark regarding the use of Services, and in the event of any conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions of an applicable written agreement you have entered into with Watermark, the terms and conditions of the written agreement shall control. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms constitute a binding contract between you and Watermark, which establishes your and Watermark’s rights, obligations, and liabilities regarding your use of the Service.

1.3 Subject to and conditioned on payment of fees for the Service and compliance with the Terms and all other terms and conditions of the OSA, if applicable, Watermark grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use the Service subject to any further limitations and restrictions established by the Organization for its end users. Your rights to access the Service cease when the Organization stops payment or terminates the Organization’s agreement with Watermark.

1.4 Subject to any applicable OSA, Watermark may modify the Terms at any time. Changes will become effective when Watermark posts the modified Terms on the Website. Continued use of the Service by you constitutes acceptance of the Terms as modified.

**12\. MISCELLANEOUS**

12.1 In the event that any provision of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, pursuant to judicial decree or decision, the remainder of this agreement shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.

12.2 You acknowledge that Watermark will be irreparably harmed by any breach of the Terms by you or by your unauthorized use of the Materials or the Service and, further, that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for such harm. You agree that Watermark shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies and without further demonstration of irreparable harm or the inadequacy of monetary damages, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in the event of any breach of this agreement by you or by your unauthorized use of the Materials or the Service.

12.3 Nothing in the Terms, express or implied, is intended to make any person or entity that is not a signer to the OSA a third-party beneficiary of any right created by the OSA or by operation of law.

12.4 If any party to the Terms is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by force majeure to carry out its obligations under this agreement, that party shall give to the other party prompt written notice of the force majeure event; thereupon the obligations of the party giving the notice, so far as they are affected by the force majeure, shall be suspended during, but no longer than, the continuance of the force majeure. The affected party shall use all reasonable diligence to remove the force majeure situation as quickly as practicable, provided that resolution of a force majeure event shall be at the sole discretion of the affected party. The term “force majeure” as herein contemplated, shall mean an act of God, strike, lockout, or other industrial disturbance, act of the public enemy, war, blockade, public riot, plague, pandemic, lightening, fire, storm, flood, earthquake, explosion, governmental action, governmental delay, restraint or inaction, unavailability of equipment, service or supplies and any other cause, whether of a kind specifically enumerated above or otherwise which is not reasonably within the control of the party claiming suspension.

12.5 The meaning of this agreement cannot be changed by your or Watermark’s conduct, even if repeated, or by any custom or practice of others engaged in the same or similar businesses.

12.6 Neither party is, nor shall be deemed to be, an employee, agent, co-venturer, or legal representative of the other party for any purpose. The parties are independent contractors. Neither this agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be transferable or assignable by you without the prior written consent of Watermark. Subject to the foregoing, the rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding on each party and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Whenever possible, each provision of the Terms shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective, valid and enforceable under applicable law, but if any provision of the Terms is held to be prohibited by or invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity or unenforceability, without invalidating, or rendering unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms. The Terms contain the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the matters referred to herein, and supersedes any prior agreements on this subject matter between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof (except in the case of an applicable OSA, as noted above). No provision of the Terms shall be waived by any act, omission or knowledge of a party or its agents or employees except by an instrument in writing expressly waiving such provision and signed by a duly authorized officer of the waiving party. No waiver shall constitute a consent to or waiver of any other breach of the same obligation or a breach of any other obligation contained herein. The Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Texas, without regard to conflicts of laws and principles thereto. The Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any suit brought by either party against the other party shall be brought exclusively in a court in Austin County, State of Texas. Each party hereby waives and agrees not to assert any claim of improper venue, lack of personal jurisdiction or forum non conveniens in any claim brought according to the terms of this Section. You irrevocably consent to service of process, delivered personally or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, at the address set forth in your end user information.
