Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out our check-out form but abandon it before completion with an email reminding you to complete your order. The “Remarketing” feature allows us to reach people who previously visited our Services and match the right audience with the right advertising message.

f. You may opt out of the automated collection of some information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at http://www.google.com/ads/preferences. Because those opt-out and preference control pages are specific to the individual browser used to visit it, and because that page is not operated by Watermark, we are unable to perform the opt-outs on your behalf.

**STORAGE AND TRANSFER**

Watermark retains personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or to comply with legal, regulatory, or internal policy requirements. Our servers are currently located in the United States, Canada, Australia and Ireland. We have office locations in the United States and India. Clients located in the EEA will have their data stored in Ireland. Watermark relies upon the Standard Contractual Clauses, in their current form, as the transfer mechanism for transfers of data from the EEA.

**THE DATA YOU PROVIDE THROUGH OUR SERVICES**

Watermark collects information under the direction of its client educational institutions and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. Watermark works with its clients to help them provide notice to users concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected. Watermark may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our clients.

In order to gain access to our websites and take advantage of the Services, you will need to provide information as part of a registration process. The requested personal information may include, but is not limited to the following: first and last name, username, phone number, email address, physical address, gender, race, date of birth, and which courses a user is enrolled in.

You may ask Watermark to correct, amend, or delete data, or withdraw consent for further contact, by directing a query to the educational institution that is Watermark’s client (the data controller). If you are an individual user who has questions or would like to make changes to your personal information, please contact the educational institution through which you use our Service.

Watermark will retain personal information we process on behalf of its client organizations for as long as needed to provide services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**THE DATA YOU PROVIDE ON OUR CORPORATE WEBSITES**

We may collect the following personal information from you, including, but not limited to:

* Contact Information such as name, email address, physical address, phone number, job title and department

**USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY**

To make our Services more useful to you, our servers or authorized third parties may collect information from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), cookies, domain name, unique device identifiers, as well as information about how you use our website and/or Services and/or a date/time stamp for your visit to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our website, our applications, and/or our Services. Please see the following links for more information about Google Analytics:

* [https://www.google.com/privacy\_ads.html](https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html)
* [https://www.google.com/privacy.html](https://www.google.com/privacy.html)
* [https://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html)

We may create anonymous data records from personal data by excluding information (such as your name) which makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze requests and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services.

Watermark and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. In accepting this Privacy Policy, you consent to our placement and continued use of cookies on your device. To learn more about cookies, including how to delete cookies, please visit [https://www.allaboutcookies.org/](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

“COOKIES” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and integrated experience with our application. There are two types of cookies: session (exist during an online session) and persistent cookies (remain after you close the browser). We use session cookies to assist in verifying your identity as you move through our website. We use persistent cookies to collect aggregate and statistical information about user activity. If you would like to disable cookies, you may be able to edit your browser to block cookies.

**PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT, DATA COLLATION, VERIFICATION, STORAGE, DERIVING INSIGHTS, DISSEMINATION OF INSIGHTS, ANALYTICS, AND SCIENCE RESEARCH**

Watermark’s products and service suite offers a digital data-rich environment that provides detailed, timely, and multifaceted insights into client behaviors. Watermark may use your data to evaluate and improve our products and services, create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data or analytics, and to improve and develop new products and services, or features.

Watermark may use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to analyze, interpret, and derive insights from the data we collect from our clients. The purpose of utilizing AI is to improve our services, personalize your experience, provide relevant content, improve recommendations and suggestions, and to improve and develop new solutions. To protect your privacy, we will anonymize and aggregate data before using it for such purposes.

We may engage third-party service providers to assist us in developing, maintaining, and improving our AI technologies. These providers are bound by contractual obligations to handle your data securely and confidentiality.

**USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We use the information we collect from our corporate websites. This collection may include, but is not limited to how we:

* Respond to your request for more information and demonstration scheduling
* Send you marketing communications
* Respond to your questions and concerns
* Providing and improving the Services
* To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations
* For our legitimate interests or those of a third party
* Where you have given consent

A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests.

**DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in our privacy policy. If we transfer personal information to a third party that is acting as our agent, we will require that the third party agree to confidentiality requirements. We do not sell personal information to third parties.

**THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS**

We may share your personal information with third party service providers that we work with. These third party services may include, but are not limited to:

* host our website and application
* provide email services on our behalf
* providing customer service
* sending marketing communications
* deliver a better customer experience

**EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS – END USERS**

We may share your information with the educational institution which is linked to your use of the Services. For example, this would apply if your educational institution uses our Services as a course evaluation and survey platform and has given you access to the Services. Remember, your Institution decides how your personal information is used. We provide most of our products and services to end-users of an institution, as a so-called “data processor” on behalf of our clients (e.g., school, district, universities, college). This means that the main responsibility for data privacy compliance lies with your Institution as the “Data Controller.” It also means that your Institution’s Privacy Statement applies to the use of your personal information (instead of ours). Your Institution determines what information Watermark is permitted to collect through our products and services based on how the Institution uses the products and services. Watermark processes your information according to your Institutions instructions and the terms of our contracts with your Institution.

**PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS**

We may use your personal information to send you updates (by email, text message, telephone or post) about our products AND/OR services, including exclusive offers, promotions or new products AND/OR services. We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information for promotional purposes (see above “How and why we use your personal information”). This means we do not usually need your consent to send you promotional communications. However, where consent is needed, we will ask for this consent separately and clearly. We will treat your personal information with the utmost respect and never sell OR share it with other organizations for marketing purposes.

You have the right to opt out of receiving promotional email communications at any time by visiting us at [https://go.watermarkinsights.com/UnsubscribePage.html](https://go.watermarkinsights.com/UnsubscribePage.html).

To opt-out of non-email related promotional communications e.g., text messages, telephone outreach, or social media posts, please contact [privacy@watermarkinsights.com](mailto:privacy@watermarkinsights.com).

**LEGAL DISCLOSURE**

In certain situations, Watermark may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

**USER ACCESS AND CHOICE**

Upon your request, Watermark will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may ask Watermark for access to your personal information, or to request a correction or deletion of your personal information by contacting us at [privacy@watermarkinsights.com](mailto:privacy@watermarkinsights.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, if you are a resident of the EU, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information.

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) (or if located in the European Union click [here](https://youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page, or you can contact us at [privacy@watermarkinsights.com](mailto:privacy@watermarkinsights.com).

Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

**SECURITY**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Our data is hosted in the United States with robust physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information, including the use of firewalls, standard SSL/TLS encryption, and backup servers.

We retain personal information for as long as appropriate to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including but not limited to satisfying legal requirements.
