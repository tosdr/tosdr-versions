### Access to Your Account and Profiles

In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the hanime.tv service, we use technology that enables us to recognize you as the account holder and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the hanime.tv service.
