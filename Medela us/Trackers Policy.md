1.1 Anonymous Usage of our Website

You are welcome to visit our Website while remaining anonymous and without revealing any of your personal data by using one of the opt-out mechanisms described herein.

However, when you first visit our Website we will display a cookie banner informing you how we will be placing cookies on your device and tracking your website usage behavior. This helps us to better understand how our customers use our Website and to improve our website offering and services, which includes providing you with a more personalized website experience and targeted offers. In case you have registered on our Website, including but not limited to by registering for “The Mom’s Room” or “Join our Community” or otherwise provided your consent on our Website to receive marketing communications (see Section 2 below), we will use such website usage information also to provide you with more personalized communications reflecting your specific interests and preferences. Please see Sections 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 below for a detailed description of the cookies and website analysis tools we use for this purpose and your rights to change your choices.

If you do not agree with the above practices and wish to remain fully anonymous, you can choose not to provide your consent, or withdraw your consent with effect for the future, by using the opt-out mechanisms available (see Sections 2.2, 2,3, 2.4 and 2.5 below). In this case, we will only collect certain anonymous information which does not directly relate to your person. For example, we may collect the number of visitors to our Website, browsing patterns and areas of interest. We analyze this information to understand how our customers use our Website, and to assess trends, statistics and our customers’ needs, which helps us improve our Website and better serve our customers.

Other than as indicated above, we will only collect your personal data if you voluntarily decide to share such information with us, such as by sending an  inquiry (via email, chat or other means) or requesting a specific service. Unless you have provided your explicit consent, and unless indicated otherwise in this Policy, we will use the personal data that you have shared with us only as necessary for enabling your use of our Website, handling your requests and providing the requested services or goods. Apart from that, we may use any personal data we receive only in anonymized form (i.e., in a non-personally identifiable form which does not allow for any conclusions as to your identity) for statistical purposes and for internal evaluation to improve our products and services. Your data will not be processed for other purposes or beyond the scope of this Policy, except where expressly permitted or required by applicable law.

**1.2  Website Consent and Registration**

In using our Website or by registering on our Website, we may ask for your consent to receive marketing communications.  For example, you may register on our Website for “The Mom’s Room” or “Join our Community” or you may register your Medela breast pump. When doing so we will ask you for your consent to send you marketing communications. By providing your consent, you agree to receive marketing communications from Medela and other third parties and you agree to us sharing your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.  As part of your consent, we may personalize the content of these marketing communications according to your needs and interests based on other information we receive and store from you, such as your account information, order history, or other information revealed by you (including, for instance, data from your usage of our MyMedela Breastfeeding App or from your participation in surveys). We will also use information about your website usage to provide you with personalized communications which reflect your specific interests and preferences.

By consenting to marketing communications on our Website, you further consent that your receipt of communications from Medela, such as email-opens and email-clicks, may be tracked by Medela using an analytics tool provided by our third party service providers.

While these service providers may be located in a country which may not provide for the same level of data protection as considered adequate in the United States of America (USA), we have taken the necessary measures to ensure your personal data is appropriately protected if being transferred outside of the USA.

You can unsubscribe from our Website at any time, and withdraw your consent with effect for the future, by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter emails you received or on our Website within the account profile.

If you prefer, you can change your settings to generally refuse cookies, to delete cookies that have already been placed on your device, or to warn you before a cookie is placed. Please refer to your browser instructions or to [www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) to learn more about how to adjust or modify your browser settings.

If you choose not to accept cookies, this may impair the usability of the Website and you may not be able to take advantage of some of our features and services offered.

If you use different devices to access our Website (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer, etc.) you will need to ensure that each browser on each device is adjusted to reflect your cookie preferences.

**2.4 Use of Google Universal Analytics**

This Website uses Google Universal Analytics ("Google Analytics"), a web analytics service provided by Google LLC  (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use our Website, including the number of visitors to our Website, the websites our visitors have come from, and the pages they visit. This information is used by us to improve our Website offers and services. As a rule, any information generated by the cookie about your use of our Website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

Google will use this information as our commissioned data processor to help us evaluate the use of our Website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to usage of our Website. We use the Google anonymization function to change the last digits of your IP address. However, if you are logged in e.g. with a Google account, Google will be able to revoke the anonymization. In any event, Medela will never receive this information and cannot revoke the anonymization.

You may prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie about your use of this Website (including your IP address) and opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites by downloading and installing a browser-plugin which is available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

In this case, an opt-out cookie will be placed on your browser that prevents any further tracking of your use of this Website by Google Analytics. Please remember that you will have to opt-out again if you delete all cookies stored on your device.

You will also have to opt-out for each device you use to visit our Website.

**2.5 Use of Google Analytics Advertising Features**

Depending on the pages you visit on our Website, we may further use certain Google Analytics Display Advertising features, such as demographics & interest reporting and remarketing features.

To enable these features, a third party DoubleClick Cookie will be placed on your device by Google (when you visit certain pages of our Website or websites from other publishers that have implemented advertising features based on the DoubleClick Cookie).

The DoubleClick Cookie stores information about your use of our Website (and eventually other websites visited in the Google advertising network), including the sites visited, ad views, page views, user interaction data, browser information, IP-address, a cookie ID, and your search history. Google will not link your name or other personally identifiable information to your DoubleClick cookie without your prior consent.

We use Google Analytics to analyze the data stored in the DoubleClick Cookie in order to obtain statistical reports on our user's demographics (age, gender) and interests. These reports help us to better understand our users and to improve our Website and services.

In addition, we use Google Analytics' remarketing features to run advertising campaigns (including Google AdWords) to users of our Website. Based on their prior visits to our Website (and their interests expressed during those previous sessions), these users will be delivered relevant targeted advertising when they browse other sites in the Internet within the Google Display Network. We may also use the Google Analytics Advertising features to help us measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

Please further note that the DoubleClick Cookie also enables Google and other third party vendors to serve targeted advertising (based on your prior visits to our Website and/or other sites on the Internet). These ads may be shown on websites of Google and/or other publishers participating in the Google advertising network.

You can manage your preferences and opt-out of Google's interest-based ads in your [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). In this case, the unique cookie ID of the DoubleClick-Cookie is overwritten and can't be associated with a particular browser. Please note that a new DoubleClick-Cookie might be placed if you delete all cookies from your device and you may have to renew your opt-out settings.

If you would like to permanently deactivate the DoubleClick-Cookie please download and install the browser-plugin which is available [here](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin).

You can further opt-out of third-party vendors' use of cookies for online advertising at the US-based [aboutads.info.choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) page or the EU-based [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/) page.

**1.2 Use of our App's Features**

Our App offers different features where you can voluntarily decide to share further information with us. Such information includes personal data concerning both baby (e.g., name, picture, date of birth) and mother (e.g., expectations/experiences with breast feeding and pumping or expected education/job return date). Our App further enables you to track and monitor prenatal activities, such as contraction information, but also postnatal activities, such as your breastfeeding, pumping and bottle-feeding sessions, breast milk management as well as your baby's weight, height, sleep, diaper changes and any further notes. Further, our App enables you to connect with our connected pumps to easily track and log session times, settings used, and record breast milk expressed, to receive reminder messages that keep you on track and notify you when your pump battery is low and to access live lactation support (if this is available in your market). You can also complete questionnaires to measure your breastfeeding success and in order to personalize your user experience with our App, the possibility to register your pump and get free access to the VIP pack (if this is available in your market), to find a store near you to buy our products and to provide feedback regarding the App. In addition, you can use our chatbot functionality and get technical support, product recommendations and breastfeeding support. Finally, you can also ask questions and share knowledge with one another on our “Mums Community” platform (“Community”). We do not request or process any personal data for the Community. However, by participating in our Community you can voluntarily disclose such data to Medela. By accepting our rules and entering such personal data you consent to the processing of such data by Medela. You can withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the respective data or by deleting the App. This will not affect the lawfulness of the data processing according to your consent given prior to the withdrawal.  
  
For Android users only: When you connect our App with a Bluetooth enabled Medela pump, the operating system requires access to the location (GPS) of the device. However, Medela does not store or use your location data at any time. Not allowing the location permission leads to problems with the connection of the pump.  
  
Unless you have given your explicit consent, and unless indicated otherwise in this App Privacy & Cookie Policy, we will store, process and use such information only as necessary to enable your use of our functionalities and services, including to provide you with personalized content, educational information, helpful tips based on your unique data and progress in the App as well as the possibility to send us your feedback about the App.  
  
You may determine your areas of interest and/or alter your choices by changing your personalization settings in the App (Tools Menu → Tests → Content Personalization) at any time. If you do not wish to receive any personalized content or services at all, you are free not to provide any personal information (and should abstain from completing the personalization questions in the App).  
  
You may further change your personal notification settings in the App (More → General App Settings → Notifications) at any time.  
  
To enable you to upload a picture of your baby, our App will ask for the permission to access your camera/pictures. We will not use the permission granted other than as necessary for this purpose.  
  
Other than as explained above, we will further use any personal data we receive only in anonymized form (i.e., in a non-personally identifiable form which does not allow for any conclusions as to your identity) for statistical purposes and for internal evaluation to improve our products and services. Your personal data will not be processed for other purposes or beyond the scope of this Privacy Policy, except where expressly permitted or required by applicable law.

**1.3 Processing of sensitive personal data**

Generally, we do not request or process any sensitive personal data (e.g., health information, genetic/biometric data). However, by using our App you can voluntarily disclose such data (e.g. contraction information, baby's weight/height) to Medela. By registering an account with us and by entering such sensitive personal data you explicitly consent to the processing of such data by Medela. You can withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the respective data or deleting the App. This would not affect the lawfulness of the data processing according to your consent given prior to the withdrawal.

**1.4 Creating one Single Record with Information from other Sources**

In case you decide to use other services offered by us, such as where you register for Medela Family through the Website, which provides you with free access to additional educational information and direct marketing communications about our products and services, we may create one single record for you which combines the data we receive from you through your use of these other services with the data we receive from you through your use of the App. By registering your account with us in the App you are automatically registered for the entire Medela Family Program. You can opt-out from individual Medela Family services at any time by changing the settings in your profile.  
  
This single record helps us to better understand your needs and preferences in order to more efficiently provide you with the requested products and services, including enabling you to benefit from a more personalized experience.

Please refer to your device instructions or to www.allaboutcookies.org to learn more about how to adjust or modify your mobile device settings.

If you use different mobile devices to access our App (e.g., smartphone, tablet, etc.) you will need to ensure that the settings on each device are adjusted to reflect your cookie preferences.

**2.4 Use of Google Mobile App Analytics**

This App uses Google Mobile App Analytics ("Google Analytics"), a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (USA) and Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (for EU) ("Google"). Google Analytics may use certain tracking technologies to help us analyze how users use our App, including the number of active users and user behavior (e.g., average time period of use, returning users, screen views per month, top articles). As a rule, any information generated about your use of our App will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. Since this App has implemented the IP-anonymization functionality offered by Google, your IP address will, before being transferred to the USA, be shortened by Google within the Member States of the European Union or in other contractual states of the Treaty on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases your full IP address will be transferred to a server of Google in the USA and be shortened there.  
  
Google will use this information as our commissioned data processor to help us evaluate the use of our App, to compile reports on App activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to usage of our App. The IP address transmitted by your mobile device within the framework of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google.

**2.5 Use of App Analytic Tools**

Medela further uses certain app analytic tools and services to gather aggregated and anonymized statistical information about the usage of our App.  
  
We use iTunes Connect App Analytics provided by Apple, Inc. ("Apple"). This tool collects anonymized and aggregated data from app users on mobile Apple devices using iOS. iTunes Connect App Analytics provides us with metric App usage data, such as the total number of times the App has been installed, the number of times the app has been used, and the number of active sessions within a specific period.  
  
We further use similar analytics and statistics services provided by Google Inc. (USA) and Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (for the EU) ("Google") through the Google Play Developer Console and/or Google Firebase Console. The information we receive only includes aggregated and anonymized statistical information from app users on Android devices, such as install and upgrade numbers, crash numbers, information about a crash, user ratings, acquisition channels, and visitor regions.  
  
If the respective feature is enabled on your device, Apple or Google (respectively) will collect, process and use such information to help us evaluate the use of our App, to compile reports on App activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to the usage of our App.  
  
We only receive the above information if you have opted-in to share your data with third-party providers on your mobile device. You can make and alter your choice (opt-in or opt-out) at any time in the settings menu of your device (for iOS devices see: Settings → Privacy → Diagnostics & Usage; for Android devices see Settings → User and backup → Google → More → Usage & diagnostics).

3\. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

Medela is responsible for operating the App as data controller. However, to ensure the customer relationship with you is handled efficiently, and to provide you with a good customer experience, your customer relationship may be managed on local level also by the Local Group Company, which is our affiliated group company responsible for your country. Apart from that, our affiliated group companies may only receive anonymized statistical reports and other analytical data on App usage and activity which will not contain any personally identifiable information.  
  
In addition, Medela and/or the Local Group Company may use external technical service providers which are authorized to provide services on its behalf and in accordance with its instructions. These entities may have access to your personal data but only to the extent necessary to enable your use of our App, including providing related services or handling your requests or enquiries. For instance, Medela (and/or, as applicable, the Local Group Company) may use service providers to develop and/or host the App, to store your data, to enable the chatbot functionality, to enable sharing functionality via Social Media, to manage the customer relationship, to simplify the authentication process, to provide marketing related communications about our products and services, to process your rental request, to give voice commands supported by Siri (iOS) and Google Assistant (Android) or analyze the information collected as explained in this policy. These service providers may not disclose your personal data to any unauthorized third parties or use your personal data for any purposes other than as instructed. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside Switzerland and the EU/EEA which may not provide for the same level of data protection as in your country of residence. However, Medela and/or, as applicable, the Local Group Company have appropriate agreements in place with these service providers to ensure that they will take all necessary measures to protect your personal data in accordance with applicable requirements.

While the laws of those countries may not provide for the same level of data protection as considered adequate in Switzerland or the EU/EEA, we have taken the necessary measures to ensure your personal data will be handled and protected appropriately and only be processed on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.  
  
All your personal data will be irreversibly and automatically deleted after one year of inactivity (not using the App). Personal data of USA and Canadian residents will be deleted after three years of inactivity.  
  
Any publication on our Community allows access to your personal data from anywhere in the world. This means that countries that do not guarantee the same level of data protection as your country of residence might, can also access the data.  
  
We reserve the right to delete all your personal data irreversibly and automatically after one year of inactivity (not using the App). You can delete all your personal data upon your request (go to “more”  “mom profile”  “delete account”).

--------------------------------

NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy

**This Privacy & Cookie Policy ("NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy") applies to the mobile application NPWT App ("App") which is operated by Medela AG, Lättichstrasse 4b, 6340 Baar, Switzerland ("Medela" or "we").**

This NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy governs the collection, processing and use of your personal data, when you use our App, and explains our practices with respect to the placement of cookies, including the types of cookies we use and how you can manage them.

The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the App. By means of this NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy, Medela would like to inform the App users of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.

Medela built this App as a free app. It is provided by Medela at no cost and is intended for use as is.

If you choose to use this App, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy.

This App does not collect any personal data. However, it has implemented Google Analytics for Firebase. What this means is described below:

**Google Analytics for Firebase (Google Inc.)**

Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your device, to allow us to analyze how users use the App. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this App is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, IP anonymisation is activated. Therefore, Google will reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.

Google will use this information as our commissioned data processor to help us evaluate the use of our App, to compile reports on App activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to usage of our App. The IP address transmitted by your mobile device within the framework of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google. Our legitimate interest in data processing also lies in these purposes. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Sessions and campaigns are terminated after a certain period of time. By default, sessions are closed after 30 minutes without activity and campaigns after six months. The time limit for campaigns may not exceed two years. For more information on terms of use and data protection, please visit [www.firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms](https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms).

We reserve the right to make changes to this NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy at any time with effect for the future. The then current version of this NPWT App Privacy & Cookie Policy will be made available within the App Store/ Google Play. While we do not intend to make changes to this policy very often, it is always a good idea to double check our most current policy statement when you visit us to be sure that you have read and agree with what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**Authorizations.**  Other uses or disclosures of your Protected Health Information not described above will only be made with your written authorization.  For example, in general and subject to specific conditions, we will not use or disclose your protected health information for marketing; and we will not sell your protected health information, unless you give us a written authorization.  You may revoke written authorizations at any time, so long as the revocation is in writing.  Once we receive your written revocation, it will only be effective for future uses and disclosures.  It will not be effective for any information that may have been used or disclosed in reliance upon the written authorization and prior to receiving your written revocation.

Your Rights

You have the following rights with respect to your Protected Health Information:

**Right to Inspect and Copy.**  You have the right to inspect and copy certain Protected Health Information.  If the information you request is maintained electronically, and you request an electronic copy, we will provide a copy in the electronic form and format you request, if the information can be readily produced in that form and format; if the information cannot be readily produced in that form and format, we will work with you to come to an agreement on form and format.  If we cannot agree on an electronic form and format, we will provide you with a paper copy.

To inspect and copy your Protected Health Information, you must submit your request in writing to the  Privacy Officer_._  If you request a copy of the information, we may charge a reasonable fee for the costs of copying, mailing, or other supplies associated with your request.

We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain very limited circumstances.  If you are denied access to your medical information, you may request that the denial be reviewed by submitting a written request to the Privacy Officer_._

**Right to Amend.**  If you feel that the Protected Health Information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the information.  You have the right to request an amendment for as long as the information is kept by or for Medela.

To request an amendment, your request must be made in writing and submitted to the Privacy Officer at 1101 Corporate Drive, McHenry, Illinois 60050_._  In addition, you must provide a reason that supports your request.

We may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request.  In addition, we may deny your request if you ask us to amend information that:

* Is not part of the medical information kept by or for Medela;
* Was not created by us, unless the person or entity that created the information is no longer available to make the amendment;
* Is not part of the information that you would be permitted to inspect and copy; or
* Is already accurate and complete.

If we deny your request, you have the right to file a statement of disagreement with us and any future disclosures of the disputed information will include your statement.

**Right to an Accounting of Disclosures.**  You have the right to request an “accounting” of certain disclosures of your Protected Health Information.  The accounting will not include (1) disclosures for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations; (2) disclosures made to you; (3) disclosures made pursuant to your authorization; (4) disclosures made to friends or family in your presence or because of an emergency; (5) disclosures for national security purposes; and (6) disclosures incidental to otherwise permissible disclosures.

To request this list or accounting of disclosures, you must submit your request in writing to the Privacy Officer_._  Your request must state the time period you want the accounting to cover, which may not be longer than six (6) years before the date of the request.  Your request should indicate in what form you want the list (for example, paper or electronic).  The first list you request within a 12-month period will be provided free of charge.  For additional lists, we may charge you for the costs of providing the list.  We will notify you of the cost involved and you may choose to withdraw or modify your request at that time before any costs are incurred.

**Right to Request Restrictions.**  You have the right to request a restriction or limitation on your Protected Health Information that we use or disclose for treatment, payment, or health care operations.  You also have the right to request a limit on your Protected Health Information that we disclose to someone who is involved in your care or the payment for your care, such as a family member or friend. 

Except as provided in the next paragraph, we are not required to agree to your request.  However, if we do agree to the request, we will honor the restriction until you revoke it or we notify you otherwise.

We will comply with any restriction request if (1) except as otherwise required by law, the disclosure is to a health plan for purposes of carrying out payment or health care operations (and is not for purposes of carrying out treatment); and (2) the Protected Health Information pertains solely to a health care item or service for which the health care provider involved has been paid in full by you or another person.

To request restrictions, you must make your request in writing to the Privacy Officer at 1101 Corporate Drive, McHenry, Illinois 60050.  In your request, you must tell us (1) what information you want to limit; (2) whether you want to limit our use, disclosure, or both; and (3) to whom you want the limits to apply-for example, disclosures to your spouse.

**Right to Request Confidential Communications.**  You have the right to request that we communicate with you about medical matters in a certain way or at a certain location.  For example, you can ask that we only contact you at work or by mail.

To request confidential communications, you must make your request in writing to the Privacy Officer at 1101 Corporate Drive, McHenry, Illinois 60050_._  We will not ask you the reason for your request.  Your request must specify how and/or where you wish to be contacted.  We will accommodate all reasonable requests.

**Right to Be Notified of a Breach.**  You have the right to be notified in the event that we (or a Business Associate) discover a breach of unsecured Protected Health Information.

**Right to a Paper Copy of This Notice.**  You have the right to a paper copy of this notice.  You may ask us to give you a copy of this notice at any time.  Even if you have agreed to receive this notice electronically, you are still entitled to a paper copy of this notice.

**Right to know name.**  You have the right to know the name of the personal helping or guiding you through the process.

**Right to be treated with respect.**  You have the right to be treated with respect, consideration, and recognition of client/patient dignity and individuality.
