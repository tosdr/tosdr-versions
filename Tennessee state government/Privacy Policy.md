The State only collects the personal information that is necessary to provide the information or services requested by an individual.

This is the same information that an individual might provide when visiting a government office and includes such items as an individual's name, address, or phone number.

The information collected is not associated with any specific individual and no attempt is made to profile individuals who browse the web site.
