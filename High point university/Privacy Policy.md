This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we collect via the Website, how we will use such personal information, who we may disclose it to, and your rights and choices in relation to your personal information.

**2\. What Personal Information Do We Hold About You?**

_Information You Provide to Us_

We collect personal information about you in the course of providing the Website to you. You may provide personal information to us in a variety of ways, such as when you request information from us, schedule a campus tour, submit an application, donation or tuition payment, apply for scholarships, or participate in our blogs or discussion boards. The categories of personal information we collect will depend on how you interact with our Website, such as whether you visit as an applicant for admission or as a former student. The types of personal information we collect are described in more detail below.
