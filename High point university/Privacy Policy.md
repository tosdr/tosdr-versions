Last Updated: November 10, 2020

**1\. Overview**

High Point University operates the [http://www.highpoint.edu/](http://www.highpoint.edu/) website and other websites linking to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “**Website**”).

This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we collect via the Website, how we will use such personal information, who we may disclose it to, and your rights and choices in relation to your personal information.

When we use the term “**personal information**,” we use this term to describe information that may be used to identify you.

**2\. What Personal Information Do We Hold About You?**

_Information You Provide to Us_

We collect personal information about you in the course of providing the Website to you. You may provide personal information to us in a variety of ways, such as when you request information from us, schedule a campus tour, submit an application, donation or tuition payment, apply for scholarships, or participate in our blogs or discussion boards. The categories of personal information we collect will depend on how you interact with our Website, such as whether you visit as an applicant for admission or as a former student. The types of personal information we collect are described in more detail below.

**Students, Prospective Students and Applicants**

If you are an applicant for admission, certain required and optional information is collected from you when you provide this information via the online application. You will be redirected to the third-party application platform website for completing your online application. Any information provided will be subject to the privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of the third-party application platform. Third-party application platforms may share this information with us. We maintain the application information for our enrolled students.

If you make a deposit for your application or make tuition payments, you will be directed to our third-party payment processors. We do not store payment information. The privacy policies of those processors will apply to any information you submit.

If you are a prospective student and complete a “Contact Us” or “Request More Information” form, such as to request information from us or to schedule a campus tour, we may collect certain required and optional information from you, including your name, email address, birth date, intended enrollment date, your areas of academic interest, your phone number (including mobile number), your address, gender, race/ethnicity, your interest in athletics, request for accommodations for a tour, your parents’ names and email addresses, and whether you are related to a High Point University graduate.

If you share news with us about your accomplishments, we may collect certain information you provide us about your internship, career, graduate school plans, etc. We may collect your name, HPU email address, major, minor, class year, hometown, move-in day experience, and other career information you share with us, as well as pictures you upload.
