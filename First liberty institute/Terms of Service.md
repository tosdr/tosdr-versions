YOU AGREE THAT USE OF THE SYSTEM AND CONTENT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SYSTEM AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US OR AT OR THROUGH THE SITES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SYSTEM AND CONTENT WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, CURRENT OR TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR FREE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SYSTEM AND CONTENT ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, VIRUSES, MALFUNCTIONS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS THAT COULD DAMAGE OR ALLOW UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR DATA.

#### 9\. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES OR OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) SHALL BE LIABLE IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST REVENUE, LOST OR STOLEN DATA, LOST OPPORTUNITIES, DAMAGED DEVICES OR OTHER INTANGIBLES, EVEN IF WE OR YOU HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

#### 11\. Arbitration and Disputes

Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by individual arbitration in the state of Texas before a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Any appeal shall be heard and decided by a panel of three neutral arbitrators. All arbitrators shall be retired judges or justices of the state of Texas state or federal court, and shall in their substantive rulings (as opposed to procedural or discovery-related rulings that are otherwise governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures), apply the laws of the state of Texas without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rules that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of Texas. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be binding and final on all parties. The arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. If the arbitrator(s) determine a party to be the prevailing party under circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims and counterclaims, the arbitrator(s) may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrators may not award any punitive, incidental, indirect, special, or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, damages for lost profits.

Any dispute resolution proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation arbitration, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action on behalf of others. There is no right for any dispute hereunder to be brought or heard as a class arbitration, class action, or private attorney general action or for the consolidation of arbitrations.

For any matters which are not subject to arbitration as set forth in this Agreement, you hereby expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts located in the state of Texas, which shall apply the laws of the state of Texas without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rules that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of Texas.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims asserted by you in connection with the System and Content must be asserted in writing to us within one (1) year of the date such claim first arose, or such claim is forever waived by you.

You may opt-out of and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waivers set forth above by sending written notice to First Liberty Institute/General Counsel within 30 days of the date you first access the Sites. If you timely opt-out, we will also not be bound by these provisions. If you do not timely opt-out, these provisions will apply to you and us.

#### 12\. Miscellaneous

You agree that we may send to you in electronic form any notices or other communications regarding the Sites and such electronic form will satisfy any legal requirements with respect to communications or notice.

If any part of this Agreement shall be held or declared to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective but shall not affect any other part of this Agreement, and in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.

Our failure to partially or fully exercise any rights or our waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall not prevent our subsequent exercise of such right or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement. Our rights and remedies under this Agreement and any other applicable agreement between us and you shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit our right to exercise any other right or remedy.

We may at any time, without notice and for any reason in our sole discretion, modify or discontinue the Sites, delete Content, or terminate or restrict your access to the Sites. In addition, this Agreement may be changed at any time. We will notify you of such changes by posting them on the Sites. You should check the Sites for such changes frequently. Your continued access of the Sites after such changes have been posted conclusively demonstrates your acceptance of those changes.

Questions regarding this Agreement should be directed to: David Holmes/Chief Operating Officer or Jeff Mateer/General Counsel.
