Privacy policy
==============

* * *

### You and your child’s privacy are very important to us. We never collect personal information from children.

We respect and put you and your child’s privacy above all else.  
This privacy policy was last updated on 4th February 2016.

At Zaprendo, we combine technology with powerful teaching strategies to create educational tools (the ‘Application(s)’ that spark joyful learning. This privacy policy is designed to explain what information we collect through our Applications and our Site (as defined below) and all services provided through the Site and Application (s), (the ‘Services’) and how we may use such information.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the www.zaprendo.com website (the ‘Site’) operated by Zaprendo Holdings Limited (‘us’, ‘we’,  
or ‘our’).

This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors (anyone who browses the Site), subscribers (anyone who downloads the Applications) and users (visitors  
and subscribers who access or use the Services).

If you are unsure about or have any questions on this Privacy Policy and how it may relate to you or your child, please contact us here with any questions.

### What kind of information do we collect?

There are two types of data that may be collected:

1. Personal data or information  
    This is data or information that identifies a user as an individual. Zaprendo does not collect personal data in any of our apps. Zaprendo may collect personal data that parents voluntarily provide on the website such as an email address to receive our updates, blogs and newsletters. See ‘How we may use your personal data below’.We would like to stress that although you may be able to set up accounts on the Application for yourself or your child, we DO NOT collect any personal account information, such as you or your child’s name, chosen Avatar or age through the Application. Such information stays on the Application and is not made available to us.
2. Anonymous data or information  
    This is data or information which does not directly identify an individual or which may have been personal information but has had the personally identifiable information removed. Zaprendo may collect such anonymous data or information about the use of the website and apps.

Examples of such data collected are: amount of time spent on the app, screens visited within the app, information about app crashes. On the Site, we automatically log information about you and your computer or access device. For example, when visiting our Site, we log ‎ your computer operating system type, ‎mobile operating system type, browser type, ‎browser language etc. Please note that information of this type is called ‘aggregate level information ‘. This means that it does not identify the unique user or browser.
