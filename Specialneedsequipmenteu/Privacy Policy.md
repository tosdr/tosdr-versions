Our primary aim in collecting your Personal Data is the provision of our services and products to you, or of your or general marketing information to our clients, and for the purposes of marketing. We may use your information for ancillary purposes that are directly related to the primary aim, under circumstances of use or disclosure that could be reasonably expected. To remove yourself from updates about our products or associated material, you can simply inform us via email or let us know.  
  
  
When itâs possible and appropriate for us to do so, we will inform you why we are collecting your details and what we intend to do with it.

\- Health information  
  
\- Political party, association, trade union or professional body membership  
  
\- Philosophical or religious belief  
  
  
  
The same rules are true for your sensitive information as for your personal data when it comes to the holding of it for the purposes outlined, under permission given by you and in circumstances where it is either required or authorized legally.  
  
  
  
**Third Parties  
**  
We will usually receive any details about yourself from you alone. However, if we receive any information about you from anyone other than you, we will do all we can â within reason â to apprise you of this.  
  
  
  
**Disclosure of Your Data  
**  
Your personal data is subject to disclosure when required or authorized by the law, and to third parties where you approve your data to be used or to be disclosed.  
  
  
  
**Security of Personal Data  
**  
When it comes to data storage, we retain it in a way that means it is protected â within reason â from misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification. In general, most of the personal data we hold will be kept for a minimum of seven years. After the personal data is no longer required for its purposes or the seven year period, we will take reasonable measures to destroy or de-personalize information specific to you.
