Users of our Services may earn incentives for participating in surveys and other offers.

**SPECIAL STATE DISCLOSURES**

**NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS:** The following are modifications to the provisions in Section 10 Legal Notices and apply only to consumers who are residents of New Jersey. Except as modified below, the provisions in Section 10 above remain unchanged and applicable to N.J. residents:  
  
Inquire Network’ disclaimers or waiver of liability for damages incurred by you for any interruption, malfunction, impossibility of access, or poor conditions of the Services or for any other reason will not apply to damages directly caused by Inquire Network’ gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, Inquire Network’ disclaimer of warranty as to the quality, accuracy, completeness or validity of the Services and all Inquire Network’ Content (excluding third party content or information) is not applicable. However, Inquire Network’ does not guarantee that the use of the Services will meet your requirements.  
  
Inquire Network’ limitation of liability does not apply to you for damages arising out personal injury, property damage, negligence or willful misconduct or any other cause of action arising from the acts of Inquire Network but does apply to the acts or omissions of third parties. Inquire Network’ aggregate liability for all claims under any circumstances will not exceed the lesser of $100.00 or your actual, out of pocket costs and damages. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will Inquire Network be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages as stated in these Terms.

**CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.** "If you are a California resident and in connection with the foregoing release, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 (and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction) which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

#### 11\. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

**Governing Law.**  
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Laws of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that the Arbitration provisions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

**Resolution of Any Dispute.**  
In the event a dispute arises between you and Inquire Network, we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting our customer service team online by going to [https://www.GiftCardQuiz.com/contactus.asp](https://www.giftcardquiz.com/contactus.asp) or writing us at Inquire Network, Inc. PO Box 4668 #23563, New York, NY 10163-4668. If, however, there is an issue that needs to be resolved, the following provisions of this Section 11 describe how both of us will proceed:

**Limitation of Legal Remedies.**  
If there is a dispute that remains unresolved, INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND INQUIRE NETWORK EACH AGREE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE JAMS ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WITHOUT CLASS RELIEF, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES PERTAINING TO INQUIRE NETWORK’ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT PURSUANT TO LAW ARE NOT ARBITRABLE; INDEMNIFICATION; CONTRIBUTION; INTERPLEADER; OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ARISING OUT OF A CLAIM. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (“Claim(s)”). The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

**Jury Trial Waiver.**  
YOU AND INQUIRE NETWORK EACH VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES.

**Class Action Waiver.**  
YOU AND INQUIRE NETWORK EACH AGREE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. All arbitrations under these Terms must be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class, representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by any other person ("Class Action Waiver").

**Arbitration Procedures.**  
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought (a "Notice"). All Notices to Inquire Network must be sent to the following address: Inquire Network, Inc. PO Box 4668 #23563, New York, NY 10163-4668. All notices to you will be sent to the email or street address provided in your account, if available. Upon receipt of such Notice, the receiving party will have a 60 day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. After the expiration of such sixty-day cure period, you or Inquire Network may commence an arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed to by you and Inquire Network in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and Inquire Network agree that this section satisfies the writing requirement of the FAA. The arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of New York and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person or by telephone. For those claims that the arbitrator decides are not frivolous, Inquire Network will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration; (2) if you prefer, will conduct the arbitration by telephone, and (3) will not seek attorneys’ fees in the event Inquire Network prevails. Each party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses. The JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com. To the extent that this dispute resolution section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS rules and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitrator’s award; and any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled “Class Action Waiver”.

**Exception.**  
All parties, including related third parties, shall retain the right to seek adjudication in a small claims tribunal for disputes within the scope of such tribunal’s jurisdiction. Any dispute, which cannot be adjudicated within the jurisdiction of a small claims tribunal, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, with the exception of any Claim or action for indemnification, contribution, interpleader, or injunctive relief arising out of a Claim, which Claims or actions shall not be subject to arbitration. Any appeal of a judgment from a small claims tribunal shall be resolved by binding arbitration.

**Survival.**  
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

**Severability.**  
If any provision of this Section 11 is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.

#### 12\. MISCELLANEOUS.

These Terms and policies incorporated herein are the entire agreement between you and Inquire Network. They supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Inquire Network relating to your use of the Services. Inquire Network may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. Headings in the Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this agreement. The failure of Inquire Network to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of Inquire Network of any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by Inquire Network or be deemed a waiver by Inquire Network of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies of Inquire Network under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and Inquire Network shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit Inquire Network’ right to exercise any other right or remedy.
