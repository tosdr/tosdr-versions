This Privacy Policy applies to any website that includes, displays, attaches, references, or links to this Privacy Policy (each the “Site”). If you do not agree to these terms, do not access the LifeSource Site. The information we receive from you depends on what you do when you visit this Site. Except as described in this policy, we do not sell, rent, share or disclose your personally identifiable information to or with any other organizations.

#### TYPE AND USES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU:

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)** – Generally, you can visit our Site without revealing any personal information about yourself. The site does have various forms and other options for you to communicate with us and provide us information about yourself. Unless otherwise indicated, the information we request is optional, but you may not be able to participate in programs or receive information you request without providing us the required information. The information you provide in our various forms is used for the purposes obvious or otherwise indicated by the forms. For example, filling out a form to receive a newsletter may result in you receiving newsletters from us; signing up to be a financial donor or participation in our fundraising events may add you to our donor lists and may result in communications related to your donation, public acknowledgment of your donation depending on your selected preferences for recognition, fundraising events, donation related requests, and other donor related activities and opportunities; submitting information to become an ambassador may result in communications about the ambassador program; etc. Similarly, at various points in the Site we provide contact information such as e-mail addresses for various purposes, and providing us information about you or others may result uses by us related to those purposes and others related to your communications with us. If you are asked to provide us or otherwise choose to provide us information about other people, you must have consent from those individuals or other authority to provide such information to us. We only collect personally identifiable information when you choose to reveal it to us.

Note that from time to time we post information on the Site that relates to questions or issues raised by those that communicate with us, whether as a part of a frequently asked questions section on our Site (“FAQ”) or similar section. The question and answer or other information we post may be similar to, or the same as, the question or issue you submitted, but we will not identify you (or anyone else) as the questioner without your consent.

#### INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED:
