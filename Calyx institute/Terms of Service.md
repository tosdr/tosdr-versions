NEITHER PARTY SHALL, AND EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO, PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION (INCLUDING ANY CLASS ARBITRATION) WITH REGARD TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

### 15\. General

None of the Calyx Parties and the Mobile Citizen Parties will be responsible or liable in any manner for any failure in the Service or in the performance of these Terms of Service to the extent that such failure is due to causes beyond its control. If any part of these Terms of Service is found invalid (including without limitation any conflict with any applicable law or regulation) such invalidity will not affect the remaining portions of these Terms of Service, and the parties will substitute for the invalid provision a provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision. Failure by any party to complain of any act or failure to act of the any other party or to declare any other party in default, irrespective of the duration of such default, will not constitute a waiver of rights hereunder. These Terms of Service constitutes the complete agreement between you and any Calyx Party and any Mobile Citizen Party with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all proposals (oral or written), all previous negotiations, and all other communications, including without limitation communications on the website of any Calyx Party and any Mobile Citizen Party, except as set forth above.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING TERMS OF SERVICE, AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SERVICE CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF AND AGREEMENT WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN ACCORDANCE HEREWITH.
