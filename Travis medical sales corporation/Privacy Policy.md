#### Privacy Policy

Use of this website acknowledges your consent to this Privacy Policy for Travis Medical Sales Corporation and LeadVenture Inc. Protecting your private information is our priority and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we may collect about you through our website, when we collect it, how we may use it, who we may disclose it to, and is intended to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of your data.

#### Personal Information We Collect

Our primary goal in collecting your personal information is to enable us to personalize your interactions and experiences with our website.

We may collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you ("Personal Information"). In particular, our website has collected the following categories of Personal Information within the last twelve (12) months:

| Categories of Personal Information | Types of Personal Information Collected |

| B. Personal information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, a particular individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, signature, social security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driverâ€™s license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information. | Name, address, telephone number, physical address, zip code, email address, company name, credit card number, income, or other financial information you may provide to obtain a quote or complete a purchase transaction. |

#### How Your Personal Information Is Collected

We collect Personal Information that you voluntarily give or has been given through some other direct contact from you. When you access our website, we may also passively or automatically collect additional Personal Information and non-personally identifiable data regarding the means you use to access our website and the content you view when you use our website, for example, via cookies on our website.

* #### Requests for Unit Quotes
    
    If you request a unit price quote, you may be asked to provide Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, zip code, email address and other transactional information related to the desired unit purchase. Your Personal Information may be used to contact you with the requested quote or to request additional information. While not required, you may voluntarily provide financial information so that a determination can be made regarding units that meet the parameters of your requested unit quote or your pre-qualification for financing, if interested.
    
* #### Online Unit Orders
    
    If you submit an online unit order, you will be required to provide Personal Information to complete the purchase transaction. This information includes your name, email address, shipping address as well as financial information to facilitate payment for the transaction and for billing purposes. If your online unit order is not processed correctly, your Personal Information may be used to contact you to finalize the transaction. In order to process a purchase transaction, it may be necessary for us to supplement information you provide with information we receive from third party sources to obtain approval from a financial lending institution. Your Personal Information may also be shared with third parties to assist with finalizing the purchase transaction such as shipping companies (i.e., USP, USPS, FedEx) and credit card processing companies. These third-party companies do not, to our knowledge, retain, share, store, or use Personal Information for any secondary purposes outside of the purpose of providing the required services.
    
* #### Monthly Payment Calculations
    
    If you use the digital retailing tool to calculate your estimated monthly payment, you are not required to provide Personal Information unless you decide to contact the dealer to obtain additional information about the unit you are interested in. If you decide to contact the dealer, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, shipping address and phone number. Your Personal Information will be used to contact you regarding your inquiry.
    
* #### Log Files
    
    We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track userâ€™s movement, and gather broad demographic and geographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are only linked to Personal Information if you submit a form requesting additional information.
    
* #### Surveys and Contests
    
    From time to time, this website may offer contests or request information from you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you are not obligated to disclose the Personal Information requested such as your name, email address, mailing address, or demographic information (i.e., age, zip code). If you elect to participate in a contest, the contact information provided will only be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will only be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website.
    

#### Use of Your Personal Information

We may use or disclose the Personal Information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:

* to operate our website and deliver the products and/or services you have requested, and for marketing purposes. If you do not provide Personal Information we ask for, it may delay or prevent us from providing products and/or services to you.
* for more than one legitimate interest depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your Personal Information. For example, if you complete an online purchase, we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we may also maintain your Personal Information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your Personal Information is based upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business. A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests.
* to share data with trusted partners or advertisers to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, to arrange for deliveries, or for marketing purposes. All such third parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information except to provide these services to us, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

* to create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us.
* to inform you of other products or services available from us or our affiliates.
* to contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
* to assist you in locating a dealer near you.
* to respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us, or future marketing. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via phone or email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, changes to this Privacy Policy, or to send you website and service announcement updates which contain important information about the service. We may also communicate with you to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone.
* to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the website, conduct attribution reporting, personalize user experiences (including advertising or certain targeted features, such as showcasing previously viewed units), and compile broad statistical data.
* certain navigational information about where you go on our website, in order to determine what services or products are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within our website to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Such information is gathered by us in the aggregate and will not be associated with a specific individual except in connection with specific services and operations such as attribution reporting and maintenance of customer accounts.
* to respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
* As described to you when collecting your Personal Information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA or CPRA.

In the preceding twelve (12) months, weâ€™ve disclosed the following categories of Personal Information for a business purpose:

#### Data Retention

We retain Personal Information we collect from you for the period of time that is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website.

This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements and is expressly made part of the information contained in the Privacy Policy and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California ("consumers" or "you"). We adopt this Notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CCPA"). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice.

Under the CCPA, we are required to disclose whether we sell Personal Information. We do not sell Personal Information, but we may share Personal Information with third parties or allow them to collect Personal Information from our Site or services if those third parties are authorized service providers or business partners who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such Personal Information, or if you direct us to disclose your Personal Information to third parties.
