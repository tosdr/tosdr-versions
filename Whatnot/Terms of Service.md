**1\. Introduction**

* * *

**1.1 About Whatnot and these Terms of Service**

Welcome to Whatnot! This document and the other documents that we refer to below make up these Terms of Service (the "Terms") which is a legally binding agreement between you and Whatnot Europe Limited, a company registered in the Republic of Ireland under company number 723475.

These Terms apply to you if you reside or are established in the United Kingdom (“UK”) or European Union (“EU”) and you use Whatnot. If you reside or are established outside of these areas, the Terms of Service for Non-European Users will apply to you when you use Whatnot.

**1.2 Definitions and Interpretation**

To make these Terms easier to read, we will refer to Whatnot Europe Limited as "Whatnot", "our", "we", or "us". We will refer to you as "you" or a derivative of you, and we will refer to a user who creates an account on Whatnot as a "User".

In some instances when describing interactions between Users we will differentiate between "buyer" Users (each, a "Buyer") and "seller" Users (each, a "Seller"). If you are an individual using the App for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside of your trade, business, craft or profession, we may sometimes refer to you in these Terms as a “Consumer User” or, if you are a Consumer User and a Buyer, a “Consumer Buyer”.

If you are not a Consumer User, you will be referred to as a “Business User” and, if you are a Business User and a Seller, a “Business Seller”.

**1.3 Other Policies**

Additional terms, policies and rules may apply to your use of the App as published by Whatnot from time to time (“Other Policies”). The main ones to be aware of are set out below for your information:

* **Business Terms**: The terms in Section 14 apply to all Business Users, and not to other Users;

* **[Shipping Policy](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407850729741-Shipping-Policy-)**:**Shipping Policy**: This policy applies to all Sellers who enter into transactions with Buyers using the App.
* **Supplementary Terms for EU Users**: If you are a Consumer User in the EU and we direct the App to you (and/or pursue our commercial or professional activities in relation to the App) in the country in which you habitually reside in the EU (an “**EU User**”), applicable supplementary provisions in Appendix 1 will apply to you (“**Supplementary Terms**”). Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a Consumer User.

We also have our [Whatnot FAQs](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) page which answers some questions frequently asked by Users.

**1.4 Acceptance of these Terms and the Other Policies**

Please review these Terms and Other Policies **before** you begin using Whatnot. By using Whatnot, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and our Other Policies, each of which are incorporated in these Terms by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms and our Other Policies, you are not allowed to, and you must not, access or use Whatnot.

**1.5 Privacy Policy**

Our Privacy Policy describes what information we collect from you, how we collect information from you, and how we use and share information we collect from you. For more information regarding the processing of personal data, please visit our [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatnot.com/privacy-eu) located at **[www.whatnot.com/privacyhttp://www.whatnot.com/privacy-eu](http://www.whatnot.com/privacy-eu)** (“Privacy Policy”).

* * *

**2\. General**

* * *

**2.1 About the App**

Whatnot is a platform accessible via website and mobile application that permits Users to set up Accounts, you to browse the application, Sellers to market and advertise products by creating listings (each a “Listing”), and that connects Buyers and Sellers of certain products (each an "Item"), that can result in a purchase of an Item (a "Transaction"), (cumulatively and individually, the "App"). Any reference to the App includes any features and associated functionalities and services that Whatnot makes available to you via the App, including, without limitation, the Video on Demand feature (the “**VOD**”) and the Livestream Clipping feature (“**Livestream Clipping**”). The App may also facilitate interactions between Buyers and Sellers to allow Users to make offers on, purchase, trade, and sell non-fungible tokens (the "NFTs"). A purchase of an NFT is also a "Transaction." We provide more in-depth information on registering to use the App and Transactions in the sections below.

In offering the App, Whatnot acts as an intermediary platform provider to allow Users to communicate and connect with each other in connection with the advertisement, sale and purchase of Items and NFTs. Whatnot is authorised by the Seller to accept, on its behalf, orders from Buyers for the purchase of an Item or NFT which the Seller makes available for sale on our App, and such acceptance will result in the conclusion of a contract for the sale of the relevant Item or NFT from the Seller to the Buyer in accordance with these Terms. You acknowledge that, where payment of any amount payable to the Seller by the Buyer in respect of an order is made to Whatnot, this shall discharge the relevant Buyer’s obligation to the Seller to the extent of the amount paid and received by Whatnot.

We use third party companies to process payments (the “Payment Processor”) by Buyers and to pay out funds to Sellers and Buyers, and it is a condition of these Terms that the Sellers will be subject to and must comply with the [Payment Processor’s terms and conditions](https://stripe.com/en-ie/legal/ssa). The agreement between a Seller and the Payment Processor is a matter for those parties, and we are not responsible for or liable for the acts or omissions of either the Seller or Payment Processor in the performance of those Payment Processor terms and conditions.

Buyers are solely responsible for the purchase of and payment for Items and NFTs that may be available on or through the App and related Transactions. Sellers are solely responsible for all Listings and any content uploaded in connection with their Account, and Whatnot is not responsible for any descriptions, photographs, assurances of quality, disclaimers, warranties, terms of use or performance of any Items or Transactions, or otherwise.

**WHATNOT IS A PLATFORM. WHATNOT FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER ON THE APP BUT IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY SALES CONTRACT BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER OF ITEMS OR NFTS OR BETWEEN ANY USERS UNLESS EXPRESSLY STATED OTHERWISE ON THE APP OR IN THESE TERMS.**

**2.2 Eligibility to Create an Account and/or Use the App**

You must be at least 18 years old in order to create an Account. By creating an Account, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age, and meet all of the eligibility requirements of these Terms. If you do not meet these requirements or, if for any reason, you do not agree with all of the terms and provisions of these Terms, you may not create an Account, and must cease or prevent any use of any existing Account(s). Teens between the ages of 13-17 may use the App only if they are using an Account created by their parent or legal guardian and are doing so with the permission and under the supervision of that parent or legal guardian. Any and all User Information associated with the Account must be that of the parent or legal guardian.

**2.3 Whatnot Users**

The App was created by avid fans who were seeking a marketplace for the Items or NFTs you can find on the App. For this reason, Whatnot does not prohibit any Whatnot Representatives use of the App, except in relation to participating in a Whatnot Giveaway (see Section 15). All Whatnot Representatives who are acting as Users must abide by these Terms. "Whatnot Representative" is a reference to Whatnot and Whatnot Inc., and each of their subsidiaries including our directors, officers, members, managers, employees, affiliates, successors and assigns.

* * *

**3\. Account Information and Using the App**

* * *

**3.1 Account Creation and Profiles**

In order to create Listings, to sell and buy Items and NFTs, and to enter into Transactions, through the App, a User must first create a Whatnot account ("Account"). A User may create an Account by selecting a user name and password; providing certain requested information (such as first name and last name), which, for the purposes of these Terms, will be considered (together with any content supplied as part of any application to become a Seller, if applicable) "User Information"; and accepting these Terms.

All Sellers must provide the following information in their Profile: (1) first and last name, (2) email address, (3) physical address, (4) phone number, and (5) a social media account. All Users may provide additional information as requested in your Profile and Account (the foregoing will also be considered "User Information").

Once an Account is created, if the User wishes to create Listings and to sell Items or NFTs, the User will need to apply to become a Seller by submitting an application via the App to become a Seller, after which point the User may be permitted, at our discretion, to create Listings and to sell Items or NFTs on the App. All applications to become a Seller must be approved by us in advance of any Seller to create Listings, selling Items or NFTs, or entering into Transactions on the App. All User Information you provide to register with the App, is governed by our [Privacy Policy](http://www.whatnot.com/privacy-eu).

It is a condition of your use of the App that all the User Information you provide is, current, complete, accurate, and not false or misleading. However, please note that Whatnot does not verify or ensure such User Information is correct, accurate, complete and not misleading.

When you create an Account on the mobile application of the App on your mobile device, Whatnot will ask your permission to synchronise the App with your phone contacts to determine if you are already connected to Users, so that you can follow any such contacts you are already connected with on the App and have the option (if you want) to invite contacts who are not Users to join the App. Should you choose to invite contacts who are not Users to join the App, you are solely responsible for obtaining consent from your contacts and ensuring they consent to receiving your invite and are aware of how their personal data is being processed. You can always change whether or not you want to allow Whatnot to access your contacts using the privacy settings on your mobile device.

By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you agree to be bound by the Royal Mail General Terms and Conditions in effect at the time of shipping with Royal Mail, located at https://www.royalmail.com/sites/royalmail.com/files/2024-03/General-Terms-and-Conditions-version-14.1.pdf.

**3.2 Account and User Information Protection**

It is your responsibility to protect your personal data and maintain the confidentiality of your User Information. You agree to change your password and notify us immediately if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or User Information, or any unauthorized breach of your Account or User Information.

You also acknowledge that your Account and User Information is personal to you and agree not to allow any other person to access the App or any portion of it using your User Information, unless you have provided them with permission to do so. In the event you choose to provide others with permission to access and/or use your Account or User Information, you do so at your own risk. You acknowledge you are the owner and controller of your Account and are responsible, accountable, and liable for all access to and/or use of your Account and User Information, even if such access and/or use was not authorized.

**3.3 Unauthorized Use of Your Account**

Whatnot will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your Account or User Information, either with or without your knowledge.

**3.4 No Guarantee of Access**

Subject to Section 14 for Business Sellers, we reserve the right to withdraw or amend: (i) the App; and (ii) any feature or material we provide as part of the App; in our sole discretion without notice. In addition, the App may automatically be upgraded and updated without notice to you. We will not be liable if for any reason if all or any part of the App is unavailable at any time or for any period.

**3.5 Use and Access Restrictions**

In addition to our rights under Section 10 and subject to Section 14 for Business Sellers, we reserve the right to: (i) refuse the use of, or access to, the App; (ii) restrict access to the App, or any portion of it; and (iii) disable any Accounts and/or passwords, at any time, if in our reasonable opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms.

**3.6 Use Requirements**

For the purposes of these Terms, “User Content” shall mean any content that you may upload, post, publish or transmit (such as via a stream) through the App or otherwise provide to us in connection with the App, including, without limitation, any text, photographs, videos, voice recordings, performances, sound recordings, and any embodied musical works, including videos that incorporate locally stored sound recordings from your personal music library or ambient noise, feedback or comments.

We reserve the right to remove or disable access to any content, including User Content, at any time and without notice, including, but not limited to, if we consider it objectionable or in breach of these Terms or if we receive a complaint about such content from other Users or third parties. We have the right to investigate breaches of these Terms or conduct that affects the App. Unauthorized use of the App or posting of unlawful User Content may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution under certain Regulations.

If you become aware of misuse of our App or wish to report any User Content that does not comply with these Terms, please contact us on our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)** or by using the notice and takedown procedure referred to in Section 9 below\*\*.\*\*

**3.7 Cooperation with Law Enforcement**

Without limiting any term or provision of these Terms, we have the right to consult with, make reports to and fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities in respect of Users who breach Regulations. We may be required to comply with court orders requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any User Content (including by posting Listings) on or through the App.

**3.8 Your Rights to Use the App**

You may use the App for your personal use only in accordance with these Terms. Subject to these Terms, we hereby grant you a limited, revocable, personal, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive license to access and use the App. You will use the App in full compliance with all applicable Regulations with regard to your use of the App. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under these Terms.

**3.9 Rights in User Content**

You must not post any User Content on or through the App or transmit to us any User Content that you consider to be confidential. When you submit User Content through the App, you agree, warrant and represent that you own that User Content, or you have received all necessary permissions, consents, waivers and clearances, or are otherwise authorized to submit it to the App and grant the licenses to such User Content as described in these Terms.

You or the owner of your User Content still own the copyright in User Content sent to us (subject to any pre-existing third party rights for which you agree you have consent to use), but by submitting User Content via the App, you hereby grant us to the greatest extent permissible under applicable Regulations, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable, fully sublicensable, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide license for the maximum duration possible under applicable Regulations to use, exploit, modify, adapt, edit, cut, crop, reproduce, make derivative works of, publicly perform, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and/or make available to the public and to authorize other Users and third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, edit, cut, crop, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit and/or make available to the public your User Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented.

By posting User Content to or through the App and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Regulations you waive: (i) any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content; (ii) any and all rights of publicity; and (iii) any other rights of a similar nature to (i)-(ii) in connection with your User Content, or any portion of it. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any such User Content provided that you are able to do so under Regulations. You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content or otherwise in connection with our use of your User Content, if applicable and subject always to any Regulations.

We do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and we will not be liable in any way for any User Content except as determined by applicable Regulations.

**3.10 Your rights to use Livestream Clipping**

When you create a clip from your use of the Livestream Clipping (each clip, a “Clip”), Whatnot grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license, to copy, download, and display the Clip solely for your personal and non-commercial use, provided that you do not modify the Clip beyond what is permitted on the App and that you retain all copyright and other proprietary notices contained in the Clip, if applicable. Such uses may include, for example, sharing the Clip to your personal social media channels, creating a virtual shopping list of Items for yourself on the App, or tracking prices of certain Items available on the App. You may not, however, distribute, copy, reproduce, display, republish, download, or transmit the Clip or any portion of the Clip for public or commercial use, including without limitation, using the Clip in any ad-supported blogs or websites, or as part of a paid content offering, paid mailing list or paid newsletter. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved.

* * *

**4\. User Interactions**

* * *

**4.1 Interactions with other Users**

Whatnot has built the App in order to provide Users with the ability to connect with other Users to coordinate Transactions. The degree to which Users may interact and know each other's identity or identifying information and the degree to which Whatnot helps facilitate User interactions may vary from time to time, but at no time shall Whatnot require that Users interact with each other outside of the App.

**YOU SHOULD PROTECT YOURSELF AT ALL TIMES, USE YOUR BEST JUDGEMENT AND TAKE GREAT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN MEETING OR INTERACTING WITH OTHER USERS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SAFETY AND ANY INTERACTION YOU HAVE WITH ANY OTHER USER.**

**4.2 User Legal Compliance**

We require that Users comply with all applicable Regulations regarding Transactions, which may include licensing, business registration, consumer protection laws, product liability, and other legal requirements. We also require Users to comply with our [Whatnot Community Guidelines](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061197472-Whatnot-Community-Guidelines). It is solely the responsibility of each User, and not of Whatnot, to determine which laws are applicable to them and ensure that they are in compliance with such laws and that they have all necessary rights and licenses to list, buy and sell any Items and NFTs. You acknowledge and agree that the use, listing, auctioning, purchase, distribution, promotion, advertising, and sale of certain Items and NFTs are subject to Regulations, including, but not limited to, firearms, recalled products, products for use by children, food, alcoholic beverages, coins, and currency. You expressly represent that you shall comply with all Regulations relating to your use, listing, auctioning, purchase, distribution, promotion, advertising, and sale of any Items and NFTs through the App.

If you are a Business User, you shall at all times defend, indemnify and hold Whatnot harmless from, and against, all causes of action, claims, demands, judgments, liabilities, losses, damages, awards, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees) of any nature or kind, arising for Whatnot or any of its shareholders, members, partners, agents, and joint venturers or any Whatnot Representative under or resulting from: (i) your use, purchase, listing, or distribution of any Items and/or NFTs in breach of any Regulations; (ii) your use of the App in connection with the purchase of Items and/or NFTs subject to any Regulations; and (iii) your alleged or actual breach or breach of any Regulations.

**Please Note: While we require Users to comply with applicable Regulations, we do not guarantee or represent that: (i) all Users will be in compliance with applicable Regulations while using the App; (ii) Transactions occurring through the App comply with applicable Regulations; or (iii) all User Content and communications occurring through the App comply with applicable Regulations. To the extent permitted by applicable Regulations and except as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms (including the Supplementary Terms), we hereby disclaim all liability for any claims arising from, in connection with or relating to: (i) a User’s compliance with applicable Regulations while using the App; (ii) Transactions between Users; and (iii) whether Transactions occurring through the App are in compliance with applicable Regulations.**

* * *

**5\. Pricing Billing and Fees**

* * *

**5.1 Pricing and Fees**

At this time, it is free to create an Account and use the App. However, Sellers are required to pay fees to Whatnot related to Transactions in consideration for Whatnot facilitating Transactions on the App. These fees are detailed on our [fee schedule](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4847069165965-Processing-Fees-FAQ-) and are exclusive of VAT (the "Fee Schedule"). The Fee Schedule forms part of these Terms, and may be updated or amended from time to time in accordance with these Terms. You may close your Account or cease to enter into Transactions at any time if you do not agree to pay the revised fees as set out in the Fee Schedule. Due to the presence of these potential fees, Users may be required, upon registering their Account, to enter a desired payment method as prompted ("Payment Method").

You authorize Whatnot and/or its Billing Agent (as defined in Section 5.3) to bill you in a manner consistent with the fee structure as found in the Fee Schedule. Fees and charges that are due to Whatnot as a result of a Transaction are automatically billed to your Payment Method upon a Transaction. All payments due in respect of a Transaction must be made using the App and you may not make direct payment arrangements with any User for payment to be made outside of the App.

**5.2 Current Payment Information**

You must provide Whatnot with current payment information upon registration, change of payment information, and at Whatnot's request. You are solely responsible for maintaining and updating your payment information and for ensuring you are authorised to use the payment information that you submit to Whatnot. Whatnot is not liable for any non-sufficient funds, chargebacks, or other charges incurred by you as a result of such attempts to charge, and/or place holds on, your Payment Method or under your agreement with the Payment Processor.

**5.3 Billing Authorization**

The following shall apply if you sign up for an Account:

* You authorize Whatnot and/or any other company that bills for products or services delivered on the App, or acts as billing agent for Whatnot ("Billing Agent") to charge and/or place a hold on your Payment Method for any charges or fees related to your use of the App.
* You authorize the party that issued your Payment Method to pay any amounts described in these Terms without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that your acceptance of these Terms is authorization to the issuer to pay all such amounts.
* You authorize Whatnot and/or its Billing Agent to continue to attempt to charge your Payment Method for all amounts described in these Terms, or any portion thereof, until such amounts are paid in full.

If the Payment Method on file is declined or otherwise rejected for any fee or membership charge, the User shall have 7 days to provide updated information and payment. Failure to cure within the 7-day grace period may, at Whatnot's sole discretion, result in termination of your Account without a refund. If a User wishes to reactivate their Account after deactivation from failure to pay a fee, they will be required to satisfy any debts owed to another User or to Whatnot before a new Account can be created.

* * *

**6\. Transactions for Items**

* * *

**6.1 Item Transactions Generally**

Sellers may list an Item for sale in the App. By listing an Item in the App, Sellers create a binding offer to sell that particular Item at a specified price ("Listing Price"). When a Listing Price aligns with a Buyer's specified buying price (an "Offer"), the App processes an automatic purchase Transaction, and a legally binding contract is formed between the Buyer and the Seller at this point (the “Sales Contract”). The Buyer's Payment Method is immediately charged the total amount of the Transaction, which includes the purchase price. The order process allows Buyers to check and amend any errors before submitting an order. Each Buyer is responsible for ensuring that an order is complete and accurate. The order process is only available in the English language and we will not file a copy of any Sales Contract.

Upon the occurrence of a Transaction, Seller ships the Item to Buyer using a pre-paid shipping label provided to Seller by Whatnot or Whatnot’s third party service provider(s). Within 10 days of the Buyer's receipt of the Item(s), the applicable purchase price, less any applicable fees payable by the Seller to Whatnot pursuant to the Fee Schedule, will be transferred to the Seller via the Payment Processor (a "Payout Transaction"). The amounts available for Payout Transactions may be reflected on the App as the Seller's Whatnot Account Balance (“Balance”). It is your responsibility to ensure that all information provided is accurate for a proper transfer of funds from the Payment Processor to a User. Whatnot may be unable to recover money transferred to an improper or incorrect account based on the information provided by Users. Seller shall be responsible for the cost of fees charged by the Payment Processor for transfers, and Seller should review the [Payment Processor's terms and conditions](https://stripe.com/en-ie/legal/ssa) as rates are subject to change and are beyond the control of Whatnot.

Please note that the sale of stolen goods, goods taken without authorization, and otherwise illegally obtained goods on the App is prohibited. If you have reason to believe that an Item listed on the App was illegally obtained, please contact us immediately by messaging us on our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**. Listing illegally obtained items may, in addition to any other rights or remedies specified in the Terms, result in your Listing(s) being cancelled, your Listings and Items being hidden on the App or your Account being suspended from the App.

Whatnot reserves the right to terminate or suspend orders, cancel purchases, or to remove Listings, for a User’s breach of these Terms.

**6.2 Seller Responsibilities for Item Transactions:**

**(a) Listing requirements**

In addition to the general requirement in Section 4.2 to comply with all applicable Regulations in respect of Transactions, Sellers are responsible for the accuracy of an Item's description and all content within a Listing. Sellers are required to ensure that in each Listing: (i) the Item matches exactly the image(s) that is displayed on the App; (ii) the described condition of the Item is a true and accurate description of the condition of the Item; (iii) the price for the Item (including any shipping costs or taxes) is clearly and prominently stated; (iv) the Item listed will be safe, fit for purpose and in the quality described in the Listing for that Item; (v) all relevant safety information and documentation will be provided in respect of the relevant Item; and (vi) contain any information regarding the Item that is required to comply with applicable Regulations and to effect the Transaction. Once a Listing is live on the App, Sellers may offer that Item for sale elsewhere however Sellers must promptly de-activate the relevant Listing if that Item is successfully sold elsewhere, or becomes damaged or unavailable in the manner described in the Listing for any reason.

**(b) Sales and delivery**

Upon a Transaction, Sellers are required to ship the Item in accordance with Whatnot's [shipping policy](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/4417226783117-Shipping), which forms part of these Terms and is available at all times on the [Whatnot FAQs page.](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) To benefit Sellers, directly or indirectly through its third party servicer provider(s), Whatnot provides a pre-paid shipping label that Sellers use to ship an Item to Buyer. Should, for any reason, the cost to ship an Item exceed the pre-paid label price, Seller shall be responsible for any additional payment necessary to ship the Item.

**(c) Cancellations, returns and refunds**

Business Sellers that enter into Sales Contracts with Consumer Users are required to comply with all applicable Regulations in respect of such Transactions, including mandatory consumer protection laws. For more details, please see Section 14.

Sellers who are Consumer Users and enter into Sales Contracts with other Users are advised to publish a returns policy for any Items listed for sale on the App. Please be aware that under the Sales Contract, certain contractual obligations will apply to all Sellers and you may be liable to a Buyer if you fail to comply with these obligations.

**(d) Consequences of Breach**

Whatnot may, in its sole discretion, impose consequences on Sellers who, in Whatnot’s sole discretion, violate these Terms, including but not limited to

(i) charging an additional fee as liquidated damages in the amount of 15% of the total Transaction amount, or $12.00 (USD) for Transaction less than $45.00 (USD), whichever is greater, plus applicable Taxes (if any) and additional amounts that may be necessary to reflect the use of coupons, promotional specials, or gift certificates, and amounts that reflect the cost of a replacement Item, unless Seller can prove that damage has not occurred or is substantially less than the lump sum;

(ii) removing of any or all Seller Items from the App;

(iii) cancelling of any or all of Seller's pending Transactions;

(iv) withholding of any payments due to Seller for up to 30 days or until the violation has been remedied;

(v) limiting Seller's ability to buy and/or sell Items;

(vi) charging Seller, via the Payment Method or otherwise, or setting-off with claims owed to Seller for costs, expenses and fees incurred by Whatnot as a result of Seller’s action or inaction, including the cost of refunds or reimbursements issued to buyers for undelivered, misrepresented, or otherwise non-compliant Products or Orders, chargeback or reversal of payment, the value of coupons and gift certificates provided to the Buyer, reprinting fees, rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and the costs of collecting from Seller, or otherwise as a result of Seller’s failure to properly comply with these Terms;

(vii) temporarily or permanently suspending Seller's Account. Seller hereby authorises Whatnot to take any of the above actions as Whatnot deems appropriate and refer any unpaid amount to collections.

Whatnot may require Sellers to directly handle refund and return requests from Buyers through the functionality of the App. In such cases, Seller will bear the financial costs and responsibilities of issuing refunds to Buyers, and Whatnot is not responsible or liable to the applicable Buyers or any third party for any such refunds. When directly handling refund and return requests from Buyers through the functionality of the App, Seller shall at all times comply with the [Return Policy](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061194552-Whatnot-Buyer-Protection#:~:text=When%20a%20return%20is%20required,emailed%20a%20return%20shipping%20label.), including any applicable "Right of Withdrawal" as described under "Buyer Protection Request Time Frames (UK/EU)" in the Return Policy, and will not conduct any activities in connection with handling returns and refunds that are fraudulent, false, misleading, abusive, or deceptive. For clarity, (i) Whatnot is not responsible for, and has no duty to monitor, the actions and inactions of Sellers when Sellers are handling returns and refunds; and (ii) Whatnot may at any time and in its discretion terminate or suspend Seller’s direct access to Buyers in connection with handling Buyers’ refund and return requests, including without limitation, at the request of the Buyers.

**6.3 Buyer Responsibilities for Item Transactions:**

**(a) Fees and payment**

When a Buyer places an Offer, the Buyer is responsible for the completion of payment of the Transaction amount, including all additional fees and Taxes. More information regarding fees and Taxes can be found in our Fee Schedule. Upon a Transaction, a Buyer authorizes Whatnot to charge the Buyer's Payment Method. Each Buyer is responsible for updating Payment Method information as necessary to ensure sufficient funds and accurate information that will allow the satisfaction of payment obligations arising from a Transaction.

**(b) Cancellation, returns and refunds**

Consumer Buyers who enter into Sales Contracts with Business Sellers benefit from certain legal protections under mandatory consumer protection laws in respect of each Sales Contract, including the cancellation/withdrawal rights set out below. For all other Buyers, your rights to cancel the Sales Contract or return an Item are as set out in the Seller’s own returns policy published on the App, if applicable, or as otherwise determined by applicable Regulations.

**The following provisions only apply in cases where a Sales Contract has been concluded between a Consumer Buyer and a Business Seller and references to a “Buyer” and a “Seller” in the following provisions shall be construed accordingly.**

* **Legal right to cancel**

A Buyer has a legal right to change their mind and cancel/withdraw from a Sales Contract with a Seller under Regulations for certain Items, as explained in more detail below. A Buyer’s right to change their mind does not apply in certain circumstances, for example it does not apply to: (i) any bespoke Items that a Buyer may purchase from a Seller (i.e. Items that a Seller creates to the Buyer’s specification or are clearly personalised or have been uniquely selected at your request and provided to you); (ii) Items which are newspapers, periodicals or magazines; (iii) Items which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly; (iv) Items received sealed for health protection or hygiene reasons once unsealed; (v) sealed audio, video, software products and trading cards once unsealed (either prior to, or after, your receipt of such Items); (vi) Items once they have been inseparably mixed after delivery; and (vii) NFTs (see below for details).

If applicable, the right to cancel/withdraw from a Sales Contract will expire 14 days from the day on which the Buyer acquires, or a third party indicated by the Buyer (other than the carrier) acquires, physical possession of the eligible Items (“Cooling-off Period”). The Buyer may cancel/withdraw from the Sales Contract in respect of all eligible Items delivered or in respect of certain of the eligible Items only. Where an order is delivered in separate parts, lots or pieces, the Cooling-off Period will expire 14 days from the day on which the Buyer acquires, or a third party indicated by the Buyer (other than the carrier) acquires, physical possession of the last eligible Item, part, lot or piece being sold under the Sales Contract.

To exercise the right to cancel/withdraw, the Buyer must inform the Seller of the decision to cancel/withdraw from the Sales Contract by making a clear statement (e.g. an email). The Buyer may use the following model cancellation form to do this but they are not required to do so:

    Model Cancellation Form
    To: [seller name], [seller address]
    E-mail address: [seller address]
    
    I/We(*) hereby give notice that I/We(*) cancel from my/our (*) contract of sale of the following goods(*)/for the provision of the following service*,
    
    Ordered on(*)/received on(*)
    Name of consumer(s),
    Address of consumer(s),
    Signature of consumer (only if this form is notified on paper)
    Date
    (*) Please delete if not applicable
    

To meet the cancellation/withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for the Buyer to send the communication concerning the exercise of the right to cancel/withdraw to the Seller before the Cooling-off Period has expired.

If the Buyer cancels/withdraws from a Sales Contract pursuant to this Section, the Seller must notify Whatnot of the cancellation/withdrawal request. Whatnot will then perform the obligations of the Seller under applicable Regulations in respect of the cancellation/withdrawal and will provide the Buyer with instructions on how to return the eligible Items purchased (at Whatnot’s cost) and/or claim a refund for the cancelled Sales Contract. Any Buyer who does not receive a response from the Seller or Whatnot within 7 days of sending the cancellation/withdrawal notice should contact Whatnot directly on our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**.

If the Items have been delivered to the Buyer, Whatnot may withhold reimbursement until the Items have been received by Whatnot or the Buyer has supplied evidence of having sent back the Items to the address specified by Whatnot, whichever is earliest. Once Whatnot has received the Items or evidence that the Items have been returned, Whatnot will make the reimbursement for any eligible Items within 14 days. If no Items have been supplied, the reimbursement will be made within 14 days after the day on which Whatnot is informed about a Buyer’s decision to cancel/withdraw from the Sales Contract.

Whatnot is entitled to make a full or partial deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any Items supplied, if the loss is the result of the Buyer handling the Item beyond what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Items.

* **Other refunds**

A Buyer has legal rights in relation to Items that are not as described, faulty, capable of being returned because of failure to comply with a statutory term, warranty or guarantee, or otherwise not fit for purpose. If you believe that any Items that you have purchased as a Buyer do not conform with these Terms, please contact the Seller in the first instance to try and resolve the issue. If you are not able to do so, please read the Whatnot return policy which can be found on the [Whatnot FAQs](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us). If you experience a problem with your purchase or Item, and you cannot find the answer on our [FAQs](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) page, please contact us using our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**.

* **NFTs**

Due to the nature of cryptoassets, Sales Contracts for NFTs cannot be cancelled and all sales of NFTs are final. If you are a Consumer Buyer, you acknowledge and agree that by purchasing an NFT on the App you are requesting that the NFT is provided to you immediately, that you will receive the benefit of such product immediately, and that in doing so you will waive your rights under consumer protection legislation to cancel/withdraw from such Sales Contract for the NFT.

**6.4 Whatnot Responsibilities for Item Transactions:**

Each Seller must ship the Item directly to the Buyer using the pre-paid shipping label provided to the Seller by Whatnot or Whatnot’s third party service provider(s). Whatnot, through the Payment Processor, will issue payment to Seller within 10 days of the date of evidence of Buyer's receipt of the Item(s). In the event that a Buyer disputes the Item or the Transaction for any reason, Whatnot may, delay the distribution of payment, request the Item be sent to Whatnot, request the Item be returned to the Seller, or issue a refund to the Buyer. This list of actions is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.

Whatnot may provide, in the App, historical Whatnot sales data and estimated values for Items. Whatnot is under no obligation to provide such data, but rather may choose to do so for the benefit of its Users. Whatnot's historical sales data and estimated values in no way suggest or guarantee that Items will sell for an amount that is close to or that exceeds the amount of any past Transaction or for estimated value. We hereby disclaim all liability for any claims arising from, in connection with or relating to any historical sales data or estimated values for Items that we may provide on the App.

**6.5 Listing Placement and Rankings**

The placement and ranking of Listings by Sellers on the App is determined by the following factors: (i) the product category of the Item you are offering for sale; (ii) relevance of your Listing to search terms entered on the App; (iii) the date on which your Listing was added; and (iv) the price of the Item you are offering for sale.

We may restrict or suspend a Listing from the App if we believe it contravenes these Terms. If you are a Business Seller, we shall endeavour to provide you with a written statement of reasons for our decision. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not review any Listing prior to it being uploaded and are not obliged to once it is live on the App, but we reserve the right to take down and/or restrict access to any Listing that we believe contravenes these Terms.

**6.6 Auction Transactions**

Certain Sellers may be permitted to conduct a live auction on the App for the bidding and purchase of Items ("**Auction**"). Eligibility to host an Auction will be determined in Whatnot's sole discretion. The defined term "Transaction" as used these Terms, will include Auctions, as applicable.

**(a) User Content in an Auction**

Whenever you upload or transmit User Content through the App in connection with an Auction, you must comply with the standards described under "Going Live On Whatnot" currently available at: [https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/4416939590797-Going-Live-](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/4416939590797-Going-Live-) as may be updated by Whatnot from time to time. You warrant that your User Content does comply with those standards. Please be aware that when you stream on the App as a Seller, Whatnot may record and store your stream and make a copy available to the public in accordance with Section 3.9 and as further described in our Privacy Policy located at [www.whatnot.com/privacyhttp://www.whatnot.com/privacy-eu](http://www.whatnot.com/privacy-eu).

**(b) Auction Eligibility and Fees**

If you participate in or host an Auction, you agree to be bound by and pay all fees according to the Live Auction Rules, currently available at: [Live Auction Rules](https://whatnot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061605931-Live-Auction-Rules) as may be updated by Whatnot from time to time on written notice in accordance with these Terms. Each Seller that hosts an Auction must clearly and prominently display the price for the Item (which may change throughout the auction) including shipping, and other fees or taxes. These fees are subject to change by the Seller and the particular Item for sale and are set by the Seller. In offering the App, Whatnot acts as an intermediary platform provider to allow users to communicate and connect with each other in connection with Transaction, including Auctions. Whatnot is not an auction house and we are not conducting live auctions. Whatnot is authorised by the Seller to accept, on its behalf, orders from Buyers for the purchase of an Item which the Seller makes available for sale on our App, and such acceptance will result in the conclusion of a contract for the sale of the relevant Item from the Seller to the Buyer in accordance with these Terms. You acknowledge that, where payment of any amount payable to the Seller by the Buyer in respect of an order is made to Whatnot, this shall discharge the relevant Buyer’s obligation to the Seller to the extent of the amount paid.

**(c) Bidding, Buying and Conditions of Sale**

The rules for how bids are accepted, bid increments, bid retraction and cancellation, the conditions the Buyer must meet to purchase an Item in an Auction, as well as the specific conditions of sale (such as warranties, shipping costs, insurance, and the like) may change for each Auction at the sole discretion of the Seller. Seller acts as an auctioneer and makes the sole, final determination concerning bidding on the item, the sale of the Item, and the resolution of any disputes; provided that Whatnot reserves the right to cancel an Auction or a related Transaction if it determines that a bid was made in error.

* * *

**7\. Transactions for NFTs**

* * *

**7.1 NFT Transactions Generally**

Sellers may list an NFT for sale in the App. By listing an NFT in the App, Sellers create a binding offer to sell that particular NFT at a specified price ("NFT Listing Price"). When an NFT Listing Price aligns with a Buyer's specified buying price (an "NFT Offer"), the App processes an automatic purchase Transaction. Buyer's Payment Account is immediately charged the total amount of the Transaction, which includes the purchase price plus all applicable fees. When you purchase an NFT on the App, the NFT is held in the Whatnot custodied wallet(s), and the NFT will continue to be held in the Whatnot custodied wallet(s) unless and until you withdraw your NFT.

**7.2 NFT Buyers and Sellers**

**PURCHASE TERMS. NFTS PURCHASED OR SOLD ON THE APP ARE SUBJECT TO TERMS DIRECTLY BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS (E.G., WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE NFT CONTENT, AS DEFINED BELOW, OR BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH A GIVEN NFT) (THE "PURCHASE TERMS"). WHATNOT IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY SUCH PURCHASE TERMS, WHICH ARE SOLELY BETWEEN THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. THE BUYER AND SELLER ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMUNICATING, PROMULGATING, AGREEING TO, AND ENFORCING PURCHASE TERMS. SELLER MUST COMPLY WITH AND FULFILL THE PURCHASE TERMS WITH RESPECT TO ANY NFTS THAT IT SELLS.**

**WHEN YOU PURCHASE AN NFT THROUGH THE APP, YOU OWN ALL PERSONAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE ELECTRONIC RECORD THAT COMPRISES THE NFT (I.E., THE RIGHT TO SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF THAT NFT). UNLESS EXPRESSLY SPECIFIED IN THE PURCHASE TERMS, SUCH RIGHTS, HOWEVER, DO NOT INCLUDE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ANY OF THE DIGITAL ART EMBODIED IN THE NFTS AND ANY NAME, LIKENESS, IMAGE, SIGNATURE, VOICE AND OTHER IDENTIFIABLE CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDED IN THE DIGITAL ART EMBODIED IN THE NFTS, CREATIVE ASSETS YOU PROVIDE TO WHATNOT, AND YOUR NAME, LOGOS AND TRADEMARKS, AND ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE FOREGOING (COLLECTIVELY, THE "NFT CONTENT"). RATHER, UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE IN THE PURCHASE TERMS, THE BUYER HAS A LICENSE TO USE THE NFT CONTENT SOLELY FOR THE FOLLOWING PURPOSES: (1) FOR BUYER'S OWN PERSONAL, NON-COMMERCIAL USE; (2) ATTEMPTS TO SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF THE NFT CONSISTENT WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF IT; AND (3) AS PART OF A THIRD PARTY OFFERING COMPATIBLE WITH THE PURCHASED NFT IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE PERMITTED END-USE OF SUCH OFFERING.**

**COSTS AND FEES. TRANSACTIONS ON THE APP MAY BE SUBJECT TO FEES THAT WHATNOT COLLECTS TO SUPPORT THE NFT CREATORS AND THE APP, AS POSTED ON THE FEE SCHEDULE OR OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS. YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE ROYALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECONDARY SALE OF ANY NFT. YOU FURTHER AGREE TO PAY ALL OTHER APPLICABLE FEES, AND YOU AUTHORIZE WHATNOT TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOU FOR ANY SUCH FEES OR DEDUCT SUCH FEES (INCLUDING THE TRANSACTION FEE) DIRECTLY FROM YOUR AMOUNTS PAID BY THE BUYER. THE PAYMENTS MADE TO SELLERS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY TAXES (AS DEFINED BELOW), AND WHATNOT SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF SUCH TAXES REGARDLESS OF THE TAXING AUTHORITY. EACH PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TAXES IMPOSED ON ITS INCOME OR PROPERTY. BUYERS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ALL SUCH FEES.**

**REVENUE SHARE AND FEES. IF YOU ARE A SELLER, YOU WILL RECEIVE REVENUE LESS THE TRANSACTION FEE FOR EACH INITIAL SALE OF YOUR NFT ON THE APP. "REVENUE" MEANS THE GROSS AMOUNT PAID BY THE BUYER OF A SALE OF YOUR NFT ON THE APP. "TRANSACTION FEE" MEANS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE GROSS AMOUNT PAID BY THE PURCHASE IN AN INITIAL SALE OF YOUR NFT, AS NOTED IN THE FEE SCHEDULE.**

**WITHDRAWING YOUR NFT. YOU MAY WITHDRAW YOUR NFT FROM THE WHATNOT CUSTODIED WALLET(S) AT ANY TIME. TO WITHDRAW YOUR NFT, YOU MUST PROVIDE AN ADDRESS TO WHICH YOU WANT THE WITHDRAWAL TO BE SENT. WHATNOT HAS THE DISCRETION TO REVIEW THE WITHDRAWAL REQUESTS BEFORE PROCESSING, AND IN SOME CASES, WHATNOT MAY LOCK AN NFT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME, IF NECESSARY, TO PREVENT FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR. YOU FURTHER AGREE TO PAY ALL OTHER APPLICABLE FEES, INCLUDING GAS FEES AND HOSTING FEES, AND YOU AUTHORIZE WHATNOT TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOU FOR ANY SUCH FEES WHEN YOU WITHDRAW YOUR NFT. "GAS FEES" MEAN THE FEES THAT FUND THE NETWORK OF COMPUTERS THAT RUN THE DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK, MEANING THAT YOU WILL NEED TO PAY A GAS FEE FOR EACH TRANSACTION THAT OCCURS VIA THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK.**

**DISCLAIMERS. NFTS ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE APPLICABLE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN SUCH BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT WE CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY NFTS OR OTHER DIGITAL ASSETS, OR THAT ANY ASSOCIATED PAYMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.** **YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF NFTS YOU PURCHASE THROUGH THE APP. NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, WHATNOT MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF NFTS ON THE APP.**

**8\. Taxes**

**8.1 Tax obligations**

**Unless otherwise specified by Regulations, you are solely responsible for all costs incurred by you in using the App (including in relation to a Transaction) and for determining, fulfilling and complying with your obligations under Regulations to register, manage, collect, report and pay all applicable Taxes, as well as any applicable related penalties, fines, charges or late payment interest. “Tax(es)” in these Terms means the taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges that you may be required by Regulations to pay, collect and/or remit to governmental agencies or bodies, and other similar municipal, provincial or state, federal and national bodies, including but not limited to VAT or other sales taxes, indirect or other withholding and personal or corporate income taxes.

You are further solely responsible for independently maintaining the accuracy of any record submitted to any tax authority including any information derived from the App. We reserve the right to report any activity occurring using the App to relevant tax authorities and we may be required under Regulations to share information about you with certain tax authorities from time to time.**

**To the maximum extent permitted by Regulations, you shall at all times defend, indemnify and hold Whatnot harmless from, and against, all causes of action, claims, demands, judgments, liabilities, investigations, losses, damages, awards, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees) of any nature or kind, arising for Whatnot or any of its shareholders, members, partners, agents, and joint venturers or any Whatnot Representative under or resulting from your: (i) breach of this Section or your obligations under Regulations in respect of Taxes; and/or (ii) failure to provide Whatnot with accurate information in respect of Taxes.**

**8.2 Seller VAT registration requirements**

_EU-based Sellers must be VAT registered in the EU to sell on Whatnot_. UK-based sellers do not need to be VAT registered to sell on Whatnot. Please seek professional advice about your tax obligations and reporting requirements, and for EU-based Sellers, your VAT registration and reporting requirements in the EU.

Whatnot assumes no responsibility for monitoring when a Seller exceeds a VAT registration threshold in any country.

**8.3 Domestic VAT**

If you are a Seller, you are solely responsible for monitoring your tax position and understanding domestic reporting and remittance requirements.

**8.4 Import VAT**

Prices for domestic purchases are VAT inclusive in the EU and the UK. For purchases from international buyers less than €150 in the EU or £135 in the UK, Whatnot will collect Import VAT at the time of checkout on a VAT exclusive basis. For goods over €150 or £135, buyers are responsible for paying import VAT and customs duties when the goods are imported.

**8.5 Import Duties**

All purchase prices are exclusive of Import Duties at the time of sale. Whatnot will calculate and display the Import Duty (when applicable) to the Buyer as an incremental charge post-sale, collect the Import Duty from the Buyer, and remit it on their behalf. The package will be delivered Duties Paid.

**10\. Termination and Suspension**

* * *

1. **Termination by you**

You may terminate your agreement to these Terms by closing your Account. Please note that if you are a party to a Sales Contract you will not be able to close your Account if there is a dispute under the Sales Contract (e.g. non-payment or non-delivery). You can close your Account on the App or by contacting us by contacting us on our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**.

**(b) Suspension and Termination by us**

If you breach any of these Terms, we may immediately do any or all of the following (without limitation): (i) issue a warning to you; (ii) temporarily or permanently remove any User Content, including any Listing uploaded by you to the App; (iii) temporarily or permanently withdraw your right to use the App; (iv) suspend or terminate your Account; (iv) issue legal proceedings against you for reimbursement of all costs resulting from the breach (including, but not limited to, reasonable administrative and legal costs); (v) take further legal action against you; and/or (vi) disclose such information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary to do so.

If we terminate your Account, any unfulfilled Sales Contracts you have entered into will also terminate.

**11\. Liability, Indemnification, and Disputes**

* * *

**11.1 Assumption of Risk**

You agree and acknowledge the world is a dangerous place and you must use a great deal of care and caution in all interactions with other Users, whether such interactions occur by phone call, electronic communication outside of the App, or in-person interactions. In the event that Users interact on the App, Whatnot encourages all Users to take proper precautions. If the identity of another User is discovered and leads to an interaction that either User considers inappropriate for any reason, Whatnot encourages the User to contact us on our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**.

**BEFORE USING THE APP AND ENTERING INTO A TRANSACTION YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING THE APP AND ENTERING INTO A TRANSACTION.**

With regards to NFT Transactions, you also accept and acknowledge that:

* Cryptocurrency assets are unregulated in many countries and are not protected by financial compensation schemes.
* The prices and liquidity of cryptocurrency assets (including any NFTs) are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the NFTs made available through the App, which may also be subject to significant price volatility, meaning that while NFTs can increase in value, they can also severely drop in value leading to a loss of capital. We cannot guarantee that any Buyers of NFTs will not lose money.
* You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, Taxes apply to your Transactions through the App, and to any profits made from investing in cryptoassets such as NFTs, once allowances have been exceeded (for example, Capital Gains Tax in the UK). Neither Whatnot nor any Whatnot affiliates are responsible for determining the Taxes that apply to such Transactions.
* Any transfer of cryptocurrency assets (such as withdrawing your NFT) occurs within the supporting decentralized blockchain in which NFTs are recorded (the "Blockchain") and not on the App. Transactions in NFTs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
* There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Whatnot will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the App for Transactions, however caused.
* A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of a certain NFT.
* The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the App and the utility of NFTs.
* The App may rely on third-party platforms to perform Transactions with respect to any cryptocurrency assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we breach or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favour or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the App will suffer.
* There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabelled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. Whatnot reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on the App. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view or access your assets on the App serve as grounds for a claim against Whatnot.
* By accessing and using the App, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of digital assets. Such systems may have vulnerabilities or other failures, or other abnormal behaviour. Whatnot is not responsible for any issues with the Blockchains, including forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase at any time. You further acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to or from the App. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing the App. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using and interacting with App.

**15\. Giveaways**

* * *

**15.1 Whatnot Giveaways**

From time to time, Whatnot may offer promotional giveaways (a "Whatnot Giveaway"). This Section 15 sets out some key terms that apply to Whatnot Giveaways, however in the event of a live Whatnot Giveaway, we will inform you of the additional promotional terms which apply to that particular Whatnot Giveaway ("Whatnot Promotional Terms"). The rules of a Whatnot Giveaway are subject to change from time to time, and Users are responsible for reviewing these Terms and any applicable Whatnot Promotional Terms, rules, terms, or other notices provided to the User in respect of the Whatnot Giveaway.

**Description:** Whatnot Giveaways are giveaways that run for a limited period of time. The duration of a Whatnot Giveaway may vary, and will be designated for each Whatnot Giveaway as per the Whatnot Promotional Terms. Whatnot Europe Limited is the promoter of each Whatnot Giveaway. Each User who engages in a Whatnot Giveaway acknowledges and accepts that Whatnot is responsible for the collection and processing of User entries, and should there be any questions, Users are encouraged to reach out to Whatnot on our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**.

**Eligibility:** Whatnot Giveaways are only available to Users of the App. Whatnot Representatives may not participate in Whatnot Giveaways, except as a sponsor to the Whatnot Giveaway. Similarly, immediate family members (including parents, step-parents, legal-guardians, children, step children, siblings, step-siblings, spouses) or household members (including individuals who have shared a residence with any Whatnot Representative for the three month period immediately prior to the Whatnot Giveaway), are prohibited from participating in the Whatnot Giveaway.

**How to enter:** Whatnot creates various opportunities for Users to enter Whatnot Giveaways. Users may have the opportunity to enter multiple times, but if Whatnot suspects that any User is attempting to manipulate a Whatnot Giveaway, such suspected manipulation may result in: (i) the removal of all entries tied to the User; (ii) a ban from current and future Whatnot Giveaways; (iii) removal of any or all User's Items or Listings on the App; (iv) cancellation of any or all of User's pending Transactions on the App; (v) withholding of any payments due to User; and (vi) limitations on User's ability to buy and/or sell Items.

**Winners:** Whatnot will conduct a random draw to determine the winner(s) of each Whatnot Giveaway. Odds of winning will vary depending on the number of eligible entries received for each Whatnot Giveaway. Whatnot will notify the winner(s) of each Whatnot Giveaway by sending an email to the e-mail address provided by the User. The winner(s) must confirm identity and entry following a win of a Whatnot Giveaway. The failure to confirm following an attempted notification will result in forfeiture of the Whatnot Giveaway prize. By entering a Whatnot Giveaway, all entrants agree that Whatnot may provide the User's first name or surname and/or username (if applicable), in a publicly available winners' list, that can be accessed by request, unless the participant notifies Whatnot that they do not wish Whatnot to make these details available. Please note that if applicable, Whatnot may nonetheless be required to provide the names of all prize winners to applicable regulators (e.g. the UK’s Advertising Standard Authority) if requested to do so. Requests for winners' list must be sent to us using our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**. Any other personal information provided by entrants is subject to our [PRIVACY POLICY](http://www.whatnot.com/privacy) and Other Policies.

**Prizes:** Whatnot Giveaway prizes shall be determined by Whatnot. The value of Whatnot Giveaway prices may vary. Whatnot reserves the right to substitute an advertised Whatnot Giveaway prize with a prize of equal or greater value than the advertised prize.

All applicable taxes are the sole responsibility of the Whatnot Giveaway winner.

**15.2 Seller Giveaway Rules**

* "**Personal** **data**", "**data subject**", "**processing**", "**controller**", "**processor**", and "**supervisory authority**" all have the respective meanings given to each of them in Data Protection Legislation.

You and Whatnot each act as independent controllers in respect of any Buyer personal data which you receive in your capacity as a Seller for the purposes of fulfilling Sales Contracts and/or any other personal data you process in connection with (and permitted by) these Terms ("Protected Data"). You and Whatnot will be individually and separately responsible for complying with the obligations that apply to them as a controller under applicable Data Protection Legislation in respect of Protected Data. In no event will you and Whatnot process Protected Data as “joint controllers” within the meaning of Data Protection Legislation.

If you are a Business Seller and you and Whatnot are found to be joint controllers of Protected Data, and if Whatnot suffers or incurs any losses, costs, liabilities or expenses in connection with data protection and privacy (including, where permitted under Regulations any: (i) fines or other sanctions imposed by a supervisory authority; (ii) compensation ordered to a data subject by a supervisory authority or court; and (iii) the costs of complying with investigations by supervisory authorities) ("Data Protection Losses") because of an act or omission by you in your capacity as a joint controller of Protected Data, you agree to indemnify and keep us indemnified for those Data Protection Losses.

**16.3 Your data protection obligations**

You and Whatnot agree to comply with applicable Data Protection Legislation in respect of the processing of Protected Data. You must not do, or omit to do, anything that would cause (or may be reasonably expected to cause) Whatnot to be in breach of this Section 16 or any provision of Data Protection Legislation. If you are a Business Seller, you must also ensure that your personnel and other representatives, processors and sub-contractors comply with this Section 16.

You shall only use Protected Data for the purposes of fulfilling Sales Contracts with Buyers and/or as otherwise permitted under these Terms, and not for any other purposes. You must not use Protected Data provided by Buyers to send unsolicited commercial messages or for unauthorised transactions, and you may not use the Buyer’s Protected Data for marketing without the Buyer’s consent within the meaning of applicable Data Protection Legislation.

You must notify us without undue delay (and in any event within 72 hours) of you becoming aware of any accidental or intentional damage, alteration, destruction, unauthorized disclosure, loss, misuse or theft of or to Protected Data (“Security Incident"). You shall provide full cooperation and assistance to us and Whatnot Representatives in respect of our efforts to: (i) investigate, remediate, and mitigate the effects of the Security Incident; and (ii) comply with notification obligations to individuals, clients or regulatory authorities.

You shall not transfer any: (i) Protected Data processed subject to EU Data Protection Legislation outside the EU; or (ii) Protected Data processed subject to UK Data Protection Legislation outside the UK unless you comply with your obligations under the Data Protection Legislation in relation to the transfer, including by implementing appropriate safeguards where required and by ensuring an adequate level of protection is provided to any Protected Data that is transferred.

You shall and shall procure that any other person you authorise to process the Protected Data shall implement (and update from time to time) appropriate technical and organisational security measures (including measures notified by us from time to time) to protect Protected Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, disclosure, or alteration which shall as a minimum be in compliance with Data Protection Legislation and, if you are a Business Seller, good industry practice.

Where applicable, you shall provide data subjects with your own transparency information about how you process their Protected Data, and respond to any data subject rights requests you receive in respect of your processing of Protected Data, in accordance with applicable Data Protection Legislation.

You shall promptly notify Whatnot in writing if you receive any notification from a supervisory authority or a data subject which relates to or impacts upon Whatnot’s processing of Protected Data. Upon Whatnot’s reasonable written request, you shall provide Whatnot with all co-operation and assistance requested by Whatnot in relation to: (i) responding to requests from data subjects exercising their rights under applicable Data Protection Legislation; (ii) responding to communications from supervisory authorities in respect of the Protected Data; and (iii) Whatnot’s other obligations under Data Protection Legislation in respect of the Protected Data.

If you are a Business Seller, you agree to indemnify and keep us indemnified in respect of all Data Protection Losses suffered or incurred by us, arising from or in connection with any breach by you (or any of your processors and sub-processors, if applicable) of your obligations under this Section 16 and/or applicable Data Protection Legislation.

Our failure to enforce, at any time, any of the provisions, conditions, or requirements of these Terms, or the failure to require, at any time, performance by you of any of the provisions of these Terms, will in no way waive your obligation to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms, or our ability to enforce each and every such provision as written.

**17.6 Severability**

If you are not satisfied with the proposed changes to the Terms, you may terminate your agreement with us by closing your Account. If you do not close your Account, your continued access or use of the App after the effective date of the proposed changes will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms.

If there is an inconsistency or conflict between the Terms and these Supplementary Terms, these Supplementary Terms shall prevail.

**1\. Liability**

In respect of Section 11 (_Liability_) of the Terms:

Users in France

If you are a Consumer User residing in France, paragraph 3 of Section 4.2 (_User Legal Compliance_) Section 11.2 (_No Warranties_) and paragraph 4 of Section 11.3 (_Limitation of Liability_) shall not apply to you and instead the following terms shall apply:

“_Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability towards Consumer Users residing in France if we breach any of our obligations under these Terms_.

_The following legal conformity warranty will apply to any digital services that we may provide to you via the App pursuant to the French Consumer Code.”_

“_The consumer is entitled to the implementation of the legal guarantee of conformity in the event of the appearance of a lack of conformity during the period of the supply of digital content or the digital services which are offered by the professional from the supply of the digital content or the digital service. During this period, the consumer is only required to establish the existence of the lack of conformity and not the date of its appearance._

_The legal guarantee of conformity entails the obligation to provide all the updates necessary to maintain the conformity of the digital content or the digital service during the period of the supply of digital content or the digital services._

_The legal guarantee of conformity gives the consumer the right to bring the digital content or digital service into conformity of the digital service without unjustified delay following his request, at no cost and without major inconvenience for him._

_The consumer can obtain a price reduction by keeping the digital content or the digital service, or he can terminate the contract by obtaining a full refund against renunciation of the digital content or the digital service, if:_

_1° The professional refuses to bring the digital content or digital service into compliance;_

_2° The bringing into conformity of the digital content or the digital service is unjustifiably delayed;_

_3° The bringing into conformity of the digital content or the digital service cannot take place without costs imposed on the consumer;_

_4° Bringing the digital content or digital service into conformity causes a major inconvenience for the consumer;_

_5° The non-compliance of the digital content or digital service persists despite the unsuccessful attempt by the professional to bring it into compliance._

_The consumer is also entitled to a reduction in price or to rescission of the contract when the lack of conformity is so serious that it justifies the reduction in price or rescission of the contract being immediate. The consumer is then not required to request that the digital content or digital service be brought into conformity beforehand._

_In cases where the lack of conformity is minor, the consumer is only entitled to the cancellation of the contract if the contract does not provide for the payment of a price._

_Any period of unavailability of the digital content or the digital service with a view to bringing it back into conformity suspends the guarantee which remained to run until the supply of the digital content or the digital service again in conformity._

_These rights result from the application of [Articles L. 224-25-1 to L. 224-25-31 of the Consumer Code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&idArticle=LEGIARTI000044132839&dateTexte=&categorieLien=cid)._

_The professional who in bad faith obstructs the implementation of the legal guarantee of conformity incurs a civil fine of a maximum amount of 300,000 euros, which may be increased up to 10% of the average annual turnover (A[rticle L. 242-18-1 of the Consumer Code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&idArticle=LEGIARTI000044138681&dateTexte=&categorieLien=cid))._

_The consumer also benefits from the legal guarantee against hidden defects in application of the [articles 1641 to 1649 of the civil code](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&idArticle=LEGIARTI000006441924&dateTexte=&categorieLien=cid) , for a period of two years from the discovery of the defect. This guarantee gives the right to a price reduction if the digital content or digital service is retained, or to a full refund against waiver of the digital content or digital service_.”

  
Users in Germany

If you are a Consumer User residing in Germany, paragraph 3 of Section 4.2 (_User Legal Compliance_), Section 11.2 (_No Warranties_) and Section 11.3 (_Limitation of Liability_) of the Terms shall not apply to you and instead the following terms shall apply:

“_Unless otherwise stated in this Appendix, we shall be liable for a breach of contractual and non-contractual obligations in accordance with the statutory provisions. We shall be liable for damages - irrespective of the legal grounds - within the framework of fault-based liability in the event of intent and gross negligence._

_In the event of simple or slight negligence, we shall be liable, subject to statutory limitations of liability (e.g., due care in own affairs; insignificant breach of duty) only: (a) for damages arising from injury to life, body, or health (i.e., death or personal injury); and (b) for damages arising from the breach of a material contractual obligation (obligation, the fulfilment of which is a prerequisite for the proper performance of the contract and on the observance of which the contractual partner regularly relies and may rely); in this case, however our liability shall be limited to compensation for the foreseeable, typically occurring damage._

_These limitations do not apply in case of fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, if we have fraudulently concealed a defect, have given a guarantee of quality, or have assumed a procurement risk. Furthermore, any mandatory statutory liability, in particular under the Product Liability Act, shall remain unaffected._

\_The limitations of liability resulting from this Section shall also apply to our executive bodies, legal representatives, employees, staff and vicarious agents and/or other persons for whose fault we are responsible in accordance with statutory provisions. \_

_Subject to the above, we assume no liability for any damages or losses caused by any unforeseeable, unavoidable and uncaused events beyond our reasonable control._

_All other liability on our part is excluded_.”

**2\. Intellectual property rights**

Users in France

In deviation from Section 3.8 (_Your Rights to Use the App_) and 3.9 (_Rights in User Content_) if you are a Consumer User residing in France, the licence granted in Section 3.8 of the Terms is granted for the duration of these Terms between you and us. The licence granted in Section 3.9 of the Terms in respect of User Content is granted worldwide for the duration of protection of intellectual property rights. Any reference to the waiver of moral rights under these Terms is not applicable to you.”

**3\. Updates**

EU Users

The last sentence of Section 17.7 (_We May Amend the App_) shall be deleted for EU Users and shall be replaced with the following:

“_You will be informed, and you will receive updates as necessary to maintain compliance during our performance of the services relating to the App, as applicable. Where you do not install, within a reasonable time, updates provided by us, we shall not be liable for lack of conformity resulting solely from the non-installation of the updates concerned. We may also provide you with updates that are not necessary to maintain the conformity of the App, but which are recommended. We will endeavour to inform you, reasonably in advance and on a durable medium, of the planned update, specifying the date on which it will take place where possible. This update will be carried out at no extra cost to you. You have the right to refuse the update or, where appropriate, to uninstall it, if the update has a negative impact on your access to or use of the App. In this case, the contract may be terminated, at no cost, within a maximum period of 30 days, unless the update has only a minor impact. However, you may not rescind the contract if we have offered to keep the digital content or service without the update, including by uninstalling the update, and if it remains in conformity under the conditions set out in this Section_.”

**4\. Disputes**

EU Users

The following shall be added to the last sentence of Section 11.4 (_User Disputes_) for EU Users:

_“If you have a dispute with Whatnot (and not another User), you can find out more information on online dispute resolution by following this link to the website of the European Commission: [http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). This link is provided as required by Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, for information purposes only. We are not obliged to participate in online dispute resolution and have chosen not to do so._

_If you are a Consumer User residing in France, you have the right to request a mediator to solve a dispute under these Terms. Please contact us on our **[help page](https://help.whatnot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)** for details of the mediators that we have appointed.”_
