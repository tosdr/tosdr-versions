**Personal** \*\*Information Collected Automatically. \*\*

When you use our Services, we automatically collect personal information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your browsing actions and use patterns, such as:

* **Device Data**. This includes technical data collected from your devices (including mobile devices) that you use our Services with, such as Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique online identifiers, browser or device information, your general location information (including approximate location (e.g., city and country) derived from your IP address), and Internet service provider.
* **Usage Data.** This includes information collected and processed about you when you're accessing or using of our Services, such as your actions with the Services, including dates, time, pages that you visit before, during and after using our Services, information about the links you click, the types of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use our Services, including information that is linked to your Whatnot account (e.g. when you place items in a shopping cart, place items on a watch list, save sellers, searches, interests, or follow users). Where required by law, we will ask for your consent to collect this information. In addition, we may collect information that other people provide about you when they use our Services, including information about you when they tag you.

We may collect this information through our Services or with the help of technologies, such as cookies and other similar tracking technologies. For more information about our use of these technologies and your choices, see the "Cookies and Other Technologies" section below.

**Personal** **Information Collected from Other Sources**.

We may obtain personal information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations. For example:

**Authentication Partners**: If you access our Services through a third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login service, or a social networking site, we may collect personal information about you from that third-party application that you have made available via your privacy settings. For example, we allow you to use providers of single sign-on services (such as Google, Facebook, or Apple) with whom you may already have an account to create a Whatnot account or to link to your Whatnot account to such single sign-on services. You can determine the personal data that we can access when authorizing the connection with the single sign-on service.

**Social Networks**: We allow you to share personal data with social networks (such as Facebook) or to link your Whatnot account to a social network. These social networks may automatically provide us with access to certain personal data they store about you (e.g., content you have viewed or enjoyed, information about advertisements you have been shown or clicked on, etc.). You can determine the personal data that we access through your privacy setting of each social network.

**Payment partners and transaction fulfillment providers:** We receive information about you from payment and transaction fulfilment providers, such as payment confirmation details, and information about the delivery of products you have purchased through the Services.

**Advertising and marketing partners**. We receive inferences from certain advertising, and marketing partners. These inferences are the partners' understanding of your interests and preferences. They may also share information, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email address and phone numbers and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Services, with your Whatnot account. This allows us to deliver more relevant ads and marketing to you.

\*\*COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES \*\*

We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies ("**Technologies**") to automatically collect information through your use of our Services.

* **Cookies. **Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience**.**
* **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons**. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:

* **Operationally Necessary**. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functionality;
* **Performance-Related**. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how individuals use our Services (_see Analytics below_); and
* **Functionality-Related**. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed.

**Advertising- or Targeting-Related**. We may use first party or third-party Technologies to deliver tailored content, including ads, more relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third-party websites. This is also known as interest-based advertising, targeted advertising, or sharing for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like sneakers. This would enable us to show you content and ads related to sneakers.

_See "[Your Privacy Choices and Rights](#bookmark=kix.v1540rufrcpk)" below to understand your choices regarding these Technologies._

**Analytics**. We may use Technologies and other third-party tools to automatically collect Usage Data and Device Data for analytics purposes. Some of our analytics partners include:

* **Google Analytics**. For more information, please visit [Google Analytics' Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To learn more about how to opt-out of Google Analytics' use of your information, please click [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
* **AppsFlyer**. For more information about AppsFlyer, please visit [AppsFlyer's Privacy Policy](https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/services-privacy-policy/).
* **Facebook Connect**. For more information about Facebook's use of your personal information, please visit [Facebook's Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php). To learn more about how to opt-out of Facebook's use of your information, please click [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads) while logged in to your Facebook account.
* **Social Media Platforms.** Our Services may contain social media buttons such as Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook (that might include widgets such as the "share this" button or other interactive mini programs). These features may collect information such as your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these platforms are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If we are not able to fulfill your request, we will explain the reason;

\*\*Appeal our Decision \*\*to decline to process your request.

**How to exercise your rights.** If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth in "[Contact Us](https://www.whatnot.com/privacy#contact-us)" below. We will review and process such requests in accordance with and to the extent required under applicable laws.

You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to submit a request through an authorized agent. To designate an authorized agent to exercise choices on your behalf, please provide evidence that you have given such agent power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.

We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law and subject to proper verification. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or to provide information necessary to verify your account.

We encourage you to "[Contact Us](https://www.whatnot.com/privacy#contact-us) if you are not satisfied with how we have responded to any of your rights requests. You also have the right to complaint to a supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in EEA and UK are available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).

**SECURITY OF YOUR** **PERSONAL** **INFORMATION**

We use a combination of physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the information we collect through the Services. We maintain internal policies and procedures that govern how we collect, use, disclose, store, protect and destroy personal information. While we use these precautions to safeguard your information, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of the networks, systems, servers, devices, and databases we operate or that are operated on our behalf. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure.

By using our Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our Services. If we learn of a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on our Services, by mail or by sending an email to you.

**INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**

All the information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, both internally and across our offices and data centers and externally with the third parties described in this Privacy Policy.

This means your information will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries which may not be the country where you live and which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live, with some providing more protection than others.

Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this Privacy Policy.

  
If we transfer personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area, UK, Switzerland, or Canada we will put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that this transfer complies with the applicable laws and regulations. For example, for information we collect:

* We utilize standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and by other relevant authorities.
* We rely on determinations from the European Commission, and from other relevant authorities, about whether other countries [have adequate levels of protection.](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)
* As described in the DPF notice below, Whatnot participates in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the UK the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework.

We are committed to subjecting all personal information received from European Economic Area ("**EEA**"), the United Kingdom and Switzerland in reliance on the DPF to the DPF Principles. We will not rely on Swiss DPF until it enters into force\_. \_To learn more about the DPF Principles, and to view our certification, please visit the DPF website by clicking [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

**Transfers to third parties**: Information about the types of third parties to which we disclose personal information and the purposes for which we do so are described in the “[How We Disclose Your Personal Information](#bookmark=kix.idqfkgp5bqwz)” section above.

**Enforcement**: Whatnot Inc. may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Whatnot Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission ("**FTC**").

\*\*Your choices. \*\*We will give you the opportunity to opt-out where personal information we control about you is to be disclosed to an independent third party or is to be used for a purpose that is materially different from those set out in this Privacy Policy.

**Questions and disputes**: If you have any inquiries or complaints about our handling of your personal information under the DPF, or about our privacy practices generally, please email us at: [\[email protected\]](https://www.whatnot.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Whatnot Inc. commits to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the [EU data protection authorities](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en) ("**DPAs**") and the UK [Information Commissioner’s Office](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-s-office-issues-three-fines-totalling-170-000-for-illegal-direct-marketing/) ("**ICO**") and the [Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/de/home.html) ("**FDPIC**") with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF.

**RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We keep your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with our Services or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after your account has been deleted. Factors determining the appropriate retention period for personal information include the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information, the purposes for which we process the personal information, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business purpose or legal reason to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it (so that it is no longer personally identifiable with you) or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
