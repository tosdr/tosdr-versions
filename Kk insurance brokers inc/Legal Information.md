Page Content

At K&K Canada, your privacy is, and always has been, very important to us. We are dedicated to providing you with superior service while protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information.

"Personal Information" is information about an identifiable individual. However, it generally does not include business contact information when used to contact a person in respect of their business role or function. Sometimes we will de-identify information in order to use and share that information for our business purposes in a way that does not identify you. For example, we may aggregate your personal information with other individuals to prepare claims statistics.

**Why we collect and use personal information**  
Collecting personal information about you is essential to our being able to provide the products and services that best meet your needs (including individuals associated with you, all of whom we refer to as "Client" in this Privacy Policy). While the personal information we collect may come directly from you, it may also be provided by our affiliates or other third parties (such as employers, insurance companies, insurance brokers or agents, credit organizations, motor vehicle and driver licensing authorities, financial institutions, medical professionals, etc.).

Personal information may be used for the following purposes:

• To determine eligibility and process applications for products and services and to provide information and services as requested by Clients  
• To understand and assess Clients' ongoing needs and offer products and services to meet those needs  
• For Client communication, service, billing and administration  
• For claims administration and data analysis  
• For fraud detection and prevention  
• For analytics purposes  
• To develop proprietary tools and databases  
• To provide consulting services to insurance companies  
• To comply with legal, audit, security and regulatory requirements  
• To obtain and update credit information with appropriate third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, where transactions are made on credit  
• Other purposes disclosed in our terms of business or disclosed to you at the time of collection, use or disclosure.

**What information we collect**  
Depending on the products or services you request, we may collect information that you provide on applications for products and services, such as your contact information, age, health conditions, financial information, employment history, and income information. To assess risk or if you make a claim, we may collect information from insurers, industry associations, claims adjusters, and consumer reporting agencies. We may also automatically collect information through our marketing programs through the use of cookies, beacons and other technologies that track how you use our website and marketing communications.

**Consent to use personal information**  
We may obtain your express consent or we may determine that consent has been implied by the circumstances. Express consent can be verbal (in person or over the telephone), written or by electronic application (including email). Implied consent occurs when we can assume you have given consent by some other action you take or decide not to take. For example, if you request a specific product or service and provide us personal information in that regard, we infer that you consent to us using that personal information reasonably to provide this service.

If you need to provide personal information about other individuals (such as employees, dependants, etc.), you must obtain their consent for these purposes prior to your disclosure to us.

When you request services from us, we ask that you provide information that enables us to respond to your request. In doing so, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure to appropriate third parties of such personal information for these purposes. You also authorize us to use and retain this personal information for as long as it may be required for the purposes described above. Your consent remains valid even after the termination of our relationship with you, unless you provide us with written notice that such consent is withdrawn. You should note that by withdrawing your consent, or not providing it in the first place, you may limit or even prevent us from being able to provide you or an authorized third party (such as an employer) with the products or services desired.

In certain circumstances, refusing to provide personal information or withdrawing consent will mean that you will not be entitled to insurance policy issuance or renewal, insurance underwriting or claims administration of existing policies. Additionally in certain circumstances, we will not need to obtain consent or explain the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information. For example, this exception would apply if there is an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual, for fraud detection or prevention, or if we must comply with a court order.

**Sharing personal information with others**  
K&K Canada only discloses personal information as is required and described in this Policy or as otherwise required by law. In providing our services, we may need to disclose the personal information we collect to affiliates, subsidiaries, successors and other service providers or agents who perform various functions for us. Such parties may be located in Canada, or in other jurisdictions outside of Canada. While your personal information is always subject to confidentiality obligations, while stored in another jurisdiction, it may be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.

Depending on the products or services that we provide to you, we may disclose personal information to insurance companies, reinsurers and other parties who have a need for the information in order to make available insurance coverage and other products and services. We also share information with claims adjusters and insurers in order to settle claims. If we are legally entitled to do so, we may share information with consumer reporting agencies, insurance reporting agencies and governmental authorities when requested to do so or in order to protect our business. We may also be required by law or by rules of arbitration or rules of court to share information.

K&K Canada develops and uses proprietary platforms and databases to gather, store and use information about insurance policies, including, but not limited to, names, industry codes, policy types, premium and policy expiration dates as well as information about the insurance companies that provide coverage to its clients or compete for its clients' insurance placements. K&K Canada uses and combines this information and other information collected from K&K Canada's clients for the purposes of developing K&K Canada's products and services and K&K Canada's relationship with its clients (for example: benchmarking, market research, data analysis, and marketing of products and services that may be of interest to K&K Canada's clients) and to help insurance companies to strengthen their offerings for K&K Canada's clients. The databases may be accessed by K&K Canada and K&K Canada affiliates to provide consulting or other services to insurance companies for compensation as well as for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

As K&K Canada continues to develop and grow, we may buy or sell parts of a business. As our businesses consist primarily of client relationships, information regarding the particular accounts or services being purchased or sold could include personal information and be one of the transferred business assets. We may also use this personal information to assess your future needs and to offer the products and services that may best meet those needs, from ourselves, our affiliates or reputable organizations selected by us. If you do not wish to receive these offers or such information, please contact our Privacy Officer as outlined below in the Contact Information section.

**Keeping information accurate**  
It is important that your personal information is accurate and complete. Having accurate information about you enables us to give you the best possible service. You have the right to access, verify and amend the information we have about you. If you identify any personal information that is out-of-date, incorrect or incomplete, let us know and we will make the corrections promptly. To keep personal information up-to-date, please inform us of any changes, such as a change of address, telephone number or any other circumstances by contacting your local office representative.

**How we safeguard personal information**  
At K&K Canada,we employ physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect our systems and all personal information under our control against unauthorized access and use. All safety and security measures are appropriate to the sensitivity level of the information collected.

Our service providers and agents are bound to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information, and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose.

Employees are governed by strict standards and policies to ensure that personal information is secure and treated with the utmost care and respect.

**Online Privacy**  
K&K Canada may collect user information from its websites (for example, via cookies which are alphanumeric identifiers transmitted from a website to a visitor's browser and IP address or web beacons that detect when you take actions on our websites). This information is used to enable us to provide you with a customized online experience and to find ways to improve our site and marketing communications. Although cookies are widely used, it may be possible to disable cookies via your browser settings. You may also opt-out of third-party cookies and beacons by visiting www.youradchoices.ca. However, in so doing, some websites may not function properly or optimally.

K&K Canada may send you commercial electronic messages to an email address or other electronic address that you have provided to us. We may ask for your express consent or we may rely on implied consent if you have made an inquiry, purchased a product or service from us, entered into a written agreement with us, or in other limited circumstances. If you do not wish to receive commercial electronic messages from us, you may withdraw your consent at any time using the unsubscribe link in the message or by contacting our Privacy Officer as indicated below. Please note that you will still receive commercial electronic messages that we are required to send to you by law or for which consent is not required, such as confirmations of transactions or information about your account.

K&K Canada websites may contain links to other third party sites that are not governed by this privacy policy. Although we endeavor to link only to sites with high privacy standards, our Privacy Policy will no longer apply once you leave this website. We are not responsible for privacy policies employed by other third parties or any foreign affiliates, since they would be governed by privacy legislation applicable in their country of residence. We suggest, therefore, that you examine the privacy statements of those sites to learn how personal information may be collected, used and/or disclosed.

Please click [here](http://www.aon.com/about-aon/privacy.jsp) to view our Global Privacy Statement, which will tell you more on how we comply with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) for EU residents.  

**Contact information**  
Please contact our Privacy Officer to obtain further information about our policies and procedures or if you have any unresolved inquiries or concerns. We will respond to you promptly and do our utmost to resolve your concerns.
