What Information Do We Collect?
-------------------------------

We take your privacy seriously and make the safeguarding of your personal information a priority. Learn more on our [Digital Security page](https://www.navyfederal.org/services/security/digital-security.html). We collect personal information in accordance with applicable law. If you seek, apply for, or obtain a financial product or service with us, we will use and share that information we collect from or about you in accordance with our [Consumer Privacy Policy](https://www.navyfederal.org/content/dam/nfculibs/pdfs/membership/nfcu_198_privacypolicy.pdf).

We may also collect personal information when you use our Sites, products, and services. Personal information that we collect may include your name or other online identifier, home or other physical address, telephone number, email address, IP address, website interactions, geolocation, device identifier, keystrokes, the contents of your communications with us, and information from a consumer report about you. 

Additionally, use of the internet makes it possible for us or other parties to collect data about your online activities over time and across different websites, including when you use our Sites. In that regard, we use tracking technology on our Sites that collects analytics, records how you interact with our Sites, or allows us to participate in behavior-based targeted advertising.

How Do We Use Information That We Collect?
------------------------------------------

We may use your personal information to provide and improve our products and services; to process transactions and payments; to conduct analytics and research; to enhance your experience on our Sites; to help deliver our ads on your web browser; to measure advertising campaign effectiveness; to respond to your requests and communications; to manage your preferences; as required to meet legal and regulatory obligations; and for any other purposes that we may specifically disclose at the time we collect or you provide your information. We do not sell your personal information.

In some circumstances, we may anonymize or deidentify your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. To the extent we maintain and use personal information in an anonymized or deidentified form, we will not attempt to reidentify the information, except for the purpose of determining whether our anonymization/deidentification processes satisfy our legal obligations.

With Whom Do We Share the Information We Collect?
-------------------------------------------------

We may share the information we collect from you in the following circumstances:

* **Affiliates and Acquisitions:** We may share information with our corporate affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries or other companies under common control) to deliver our products and services to you and for other everyday business purposes in accordance with the practices set forth in our [Consumer Privacy Policy](https://www.navyfederal.org/content/dam/nfculibs/pdfs/membership/nfcu_198_privacypolicy.pdf). If another company acquires, or plans to acquire, our company, business, or assets, we will also share information with that company, including at the negotiation stage.
* **Service Providers:** We may share your information with Service Providers. Among other things, Service Providers may help us to administer our website, conduct surveys, provide technical support, process payments, and assist in the fulfillment of services.
* **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also share your information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third-party intermediary.
* **Other Third Parties With Your Consent:** We may disclose your information to other third parties when we have your consent or direction to do so. For example, you may authorize some third-party companies to access your information to provide financial products and services such as: account aggregation (consolidating your financial account information from different sources), making payments via a website or mobile application, and tax preparation. We recommend you use caution when granting such access and ensure that these third parties have appropriate policies and practices in place to secure your information. Navy Federal is not responsible for the use or disclosure of any information accessed by or on behalf of any third party or person to whom you provide your Navy Federal sign in credentials or account information. Any use of your information is governed by the privacy policy and any terms of use with that third party. Navy Federal does not control the privacy, security, or accuracy of your information that may be held by these third parties, and our privacy, security, and other terms will not apply to any third-party services. You may revoke access you previously granted to a third party through Navy Federal’s Security Center on our mobile application or, for certain third parties, by changing your Navy Federal password. For security and other reasons, Navy Federal may block or disable third-party access to any account without notice.

Additional information on our banking terms and conditions can be found in our [Mobile Banking, Online Banking, and Bill Pay Terms and Conditions](https://www.navyfederal.org/content/dam/nfculibs/pdfs/membership/nfcu_652a_nfo.pdf).
