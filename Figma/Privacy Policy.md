We may share any personal information we collect with the following categories of third parties:

**Other Users of Figma’s Services.** When you use the Services to collaborate or interact with others (including viewing files of other users), we will share certain information with your collaborators. For example, you can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select. In addition, some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content. For example, when you comment, we display your profile picture (if you upload one) and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the comment know who made it. Similarly, when you join a team, your name, profile picture and contact information will be displayed in a list for other team members so they can find and interact with you. When you interact with a user’s file, information about your interaction, including your IP address and the actions you’ve taken in connection with the file, may be made available to the file’s administrator. If your Figma account has the “domain capture” functionality enabled, your name, email and profile picture (if you upload one) will be shared with other users across your Figma organization who share the same email domain. Please note that while we require all our users to comply with our [acceptable use policy](https://www.figma.com/aup/), we are not responsible for privacy practices of users who receive information about you through the Services.

**Figma K12 Educational Accounts & Domain Capture.** Figma for Education’s Enterprise accounts have domain capture functionality enabled by default in order to protect against unauthorized access from users with a different email domain. With domain capture enabled your name, email and profile picture (if you upload one) will be shared with other users across your Figma organization. This should be noted if email domains are shared across multiple educational institutions.

**The Public.** Content can be made publicly available by you or others collaborating on it, and in such cases any information about you included in such content is also publicly available and can be indexed by search engines. You can check at any time whether particular content is public or private by viewing the content’s settings. In addition, in connection with your posting of content on Figma Community, we will publicly share your profile picture, name, user handle, and Twitter (or other social networking site) handle (to the extent you have provided us with this information).

[Exhibit A – Supplemental Privacy Policy for Children](#exhibit-a-supplemental-privacy-policy-for-children)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Supplemental Privacy Policy for Children governs Figma’s collection, use and disclosure of personal information from children under the age of thirteen in the United States who are students of Figma’s educational institution customers (each a “**Child**” and collectively “**Children”**). This Supplemental Privacy Policy for Children supplements Figma’s Privacy Policy to notify parents, guardians, schools, and/or school districts (each a “**Responsible Parent**”) of:

* The types of personal information Figma may collect from Children;
* How Figma uses the personal information it collects from Children;
* Figma’s practices for disclosing that Child’s personal information; and
* How a Responsible Parent may request access, modification, and deletion of the Children’s personal information Figma has collected.

If a school or school district has contracted with Figma to provide the services to students at its school (the “Services”), Figma relies on the school and/or school district to provide consent on behalf of each Child’s parent or guardian after reviewing this Supplemental Privacy Policy for Children. If any provisions in this Supplemental Privacy Policy for Children conflict with the Privacy Policy, this Supplemental Privacy Policy for Children controls.

**Personal Information Figma Collects from Children**

Figma only collects personal information from a Child in connection with the creation or administration of the Child’s account or when the Child uses the Services in connection with their account.

Personal information that Figma collects in connection with the creation or administration of a Child’s account may include the Child’s first and last name, email address, IP address, photograph (if uploaded by Child for profile), phone number if 2FA is enabled, job title, and educational records or details (including those provided by a school and/or school district). In addition, if a Child communicates with Figma for support or other purposes, Figma may collect personal information from the Child.

Figma may collect certain personal information from Children automatically when they use our Services, such as Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, cookie identifiers, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, browser or device information, and Internet service provider. Figma may also automatically collect personal information regarding a Child’s use of our Services, such as analytics about a Child’s use of the Services, personal information contained in any content a Child generates using our Services, details about the Child’s files created on our Services, pages that a Child visits, information about the links a Child clicks, the types of content a Child interacts with, the frequency and duration of a Child’s activities, and other information about how a Child uses our Services.

**How Figma Uses Children’s Personal Information**

Figma only uses personal information collected from Children to provide the Services.

**Figma’s Practices for Disclosing Children’s Personal Information**

Figma may disclose a Child’s personal information:

* To the general public., if link sharing or posting to Figma Community is turned on . Content can be made publicly available by a Child or others collaborating on it, and in such cases any information about a Child included in such content is also publicly available and can be indexed by search engines. A Child can check at any time whether particular content is public or private by viewing the content’s settings. In addition, in connection with a Child’s posting of content on Figma Community, Figma will publicly share the Child’s profile picture, name, user handle, and other online handle(s) (to the extent a Child has provided us with this information).
* To other users of the Services that a Child shares or interacts with.
* To the teacher, school, and/or school district on whose behalf the Child uses the Services.
* To service providers Figma uses to provide the Services.
* If Figma is required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request.
* If Figma believes the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Figma, its customers or others, including to:
    * protect the safety of a Child;
    * protect the safety and security of the Services; or
    * enable Figma to take precautions against liability.
* To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.

In addition, if Figma is involved in a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Figma’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding or event, Figma may transfer the Children’s personal information it has collected or maintain to the buyer or other successor.

Figma K12 Educational Accounts & Domain Capture. Figma for Education’s Enterprise accounts have domain capture functionality enabled by default in order to protect against unauthorized access from users with a different email domain. With domain capture enabled your name, email and profile picture (if you upload one) will be shared with other users across your Figma organization. This should be noted if email domains are shared across multiple educational institutions.

**Third-Party Operators**

Our list of third-party operators that collect personal information from Children on our Services can be found at: [https://www.figma.com/sub-processors/](https://www.figma.com/sub-processors/).

**Parental Choices and Controls**

At any time, a Responsible Parent may use the Services to review a Child's personal information, require Figma to correct or delete a Child’s personal information, and/or refuse to permit Figma from further collecting or using a Child’s personal information. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account and/or the Services.

Responsible Parent can request assistance from Figma to change or delete Children’s personal information by sending Figma an email at legal@figma.com. Figma may require that Responsible Parent take certain steps or provide additional information to verify its identity before Figma provides any information or makes corrections.
