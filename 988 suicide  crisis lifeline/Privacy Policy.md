About the 988 Lifeline
----------------------

The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (988 Lifeline) is a leader in suicide prevention and mental health crisis care. The 988 Lifeline, known originally as the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, launched on January 1, 2005 with funding from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

Vibrant Emotional Health, the administrator of the grant, works with partners such as the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), National Council for Behavioral Health, Living Works, Inc., an internationally respected organization specializing in suicide intervention skills training, and others to continually improve crisis services and advance suicide prevention through the 988 Lifeline. This includes developing innovative public messaging, delivering best practices in mental health, and creating groundbreaking partnerships.

The 988 Lifeline has been independently evaluated since its inception by an investigation team from Columbia University’s Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene. The 988 Lifeline receives ongoing consultation and guidance from national and international researchers and experts focused on suicide prevention and crisis response.

Explore the impact of the 988 Lifeline and its network of crisis centers. Review national contact volume, find actions to take, and discover more through our [By the Numbers](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/by-the-numbers/) page.

Accessibility Requirements
--------------------------

Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), Federal employees with disabilities have comparable access to and use of information and data as Federal employees who have no disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have comparable access to and use of information and data as the public without disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

Although Federal agencies have an explicit statutory obligation to make all EIT that they develop, maintain, or use compliant with Section 508, the current emphasis is on newly procured EIT because it is the category that is explicitly enforceable by legal action. Procurement awards made on or after June 25, 2001, are subject to Section 508 (see FAR Final Rule).

According to the Access Board, the Section 508 requirements do not apply retroactively to pre-existing EIT. Specifically, the “Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards: Economic Assessment,” states that

“The standards are to be applied prospectively and do not require Federal agencies to retrofit existing electronic and information technology. As agencies upgrade and change their electronic and information technology, they must comply with the standards.” (See Chapter 2.1 Final Standards)

It should be noted, however, that other Federal regulations and guidelines (e.g., Section 501 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) require equal access for individuals with disabilities. Therefore, federal agencies are required, upon request, to provide information and data to individuals with disabilities through an alternative means of access that can be used by the individuals.
