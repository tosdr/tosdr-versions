**Welcome to Ticksy Privacy Policy**
------------------------------------

### 1\. Introduction

We, Ticksy, take the protection of your personal data very seriously and strictly adhere to the rules laid out by data protection laws and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR-EU and GDPR-UK).

This privacy notice gives you information on how we collect and process your personal data through your use of this site and any data you may provide if you contact us regarding our products and services.

Our appointed Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for monitoring and providing guidance with our GDPR status. If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us using the contact information in section 15 of this privacy notice.

### 2\. Why we Collect your personal information

We collect your personal data for one of the following purposes:  
To fulfil an order, or take steps linked to an order: in particular, in facilitating and processing transactions that take place on the site.

Where this is necessary for purposes which are in our, or third parties’ legitimate interests. These interests include:

* Providing you with services described on the site.
* Verifying your identity when you sign into our site.
* Responding to support tickets and helping facilitate the resolution of any disputes.
* Updating you with operational news and information about our site and services e.g., to notify you about changes to our site, website disruptions or security updates.
* Carrying out technical analysis to determine how to improve the site and services we provide.
* Monitoring activities on the site e.g., to identify potential fraudulent activity or to ensure compliance with the terms that apply to the site.
* Managing our relationship with you e.g., by responding to your comments or queries submitted to us on the site or asking for your feedback or whether you want to participate in a survey.
* Managing our legal and operational affairs (including managing risks relating to content and fraud maters).
* Training Ticksy staff about how to best serve our use community.
* Improving our products and services.
* Providing general administrative and performance functions and activities.

Where you give us consent:

* Providing you with marketing information about products and services which we feel may interest you.
* Customising our services and website, like advertising that appear on the site – where this involves the use of cookies or similar technologies – in order to provide a more personalised experience.
* For purposes which are required by law.
* For the purposes of responding to requests by government, a court of law, or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation.

### 3\. Lawful Basis Of Processing Information

We only collect and use personal information about you when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we use it where:

* The data subject (you) has given consent to the processing activity taking place.
* If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
* If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject
* If the processing in necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interest pursed by us or our partners.

Where legitimate interest is identified as a lawful basis, we will undertake a legitimate interest assessment which is a three-part test covering:

**The purpose test** – to identify the legitimate interest

**Necessity test** – to consider if the processing is necessary for the purpose identified

**Balancing test** – considering the individual’s interests, rights or freedoms and whether these override the legitimate interests identified.

### 4\. What Information we collect and where from

We collect personal information from you, for example, if you register to our website, request product information, call us or use any of our services. We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you navigate through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated with the Sites.
