The Standard Contractual Clauses will not apply to Personal Data that is not transferred outside the European Union, EEA and/or their member states, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 

**4\. Third Party Requests and Confidentiality**

4.1. Gather will not disclose Personal Data to any individual or to a third party other than: (i) at the request of Customer; (ii) as provided in this Addendum; (iii) as necessary to provide the Gather Services; or (iv) as required by applicable law or a valid and binding order of a law enforcement agency. Except as otherwise required by law, Gather will promptly notify Customer of any subpoena, judicial, administrative or arbitral order of an executive or administrative agency or other governmental authority (“Demand”) that it receives, and which relates to the Personal Data. At Customer’s request, Gather will provide Customer with reasonable information in its possession that may be responsive to the Demand and any assistance reasonably required for Customer to respond to the Demand in a timely manner. Customer acknowledges that Gather has no responsibility to interact directly with the entity making the Demand. 

4.2. Gather will ensure that all employees or those who have the authority to access or Process the Personal Data are bound by obligations of confidentiality with respect to Personal Data.

**5\. Data Subject Request**
----------------------------

Gather will promptly notify Customer if Gather receives a request from a Data Subject to exercise the Data Subject’s right of access, right to correct or rectification, right to object to the Processing, right of erasure (‘right to be forgotten’), data portability, restrict processing, or right not to be subject to an automated individual decision making, each such request being a “Data Subject Request”. Gather shall provide all reasonable and timely assistance to Customer, including appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, to enable Customer to respond to any such request from a Data Subject. In the event that any request from a Data Subject is made directly to Gather, Gather shall promptly inform Customer and provide the full details of the request to Customer.

--------------------------------------

In the event of a Security Incident that impacts Customer Personal Data, Gather will notify Customer within 72 hours from when Gather becomes aware of the Security Incident. In addition, Gather will investigate the Security Incident and provide Customer with information about the Security Incident sufficient for Customer to comply with any data breach notification requirements under Data Protection Laws. Gather will also take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security Incident. Gather’s obligation to report or respond to a Security Incident as provided herein is not and will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Gather of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident. 

**8\. Audit and Records**
-------------------------

**8.1.** The parties agree that any audit conducted under this Addendum, including under Clauses 5(f) or 12(2) of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, shall be conducted in accordance with the specifications identified in this Section 8.1. Customer may not conduct an audit more than once per calendar year unless Customer is required or requested to conduct an audit by a Supervisory Authority or any similar regulatory authority responsible for the enforcement of Data Protection Laws in any country or territory. Customer may contact Gather in accordance with the “Notice” provision of the Agreement to request an on-site audit of Gather’s procedures related to the protection of Personal Data. Before Customer can conduct an onsite audit of Gather’s procedures, Gather and Customer shall mutually agree upon the timing, scope and duration of the audit. Customer shall reimburse Gather for any costs and expenses incurred by Gather as a result of the audit. In addition, the audit shall be conducted in such a way to avoid causing (or, if it cannot be avoided, to minimize) any damage, injury or disruption to Gather’s virtual premises, equipment, personnel and business operations while Customer’s personnel are on those virtual premises in the course of such an audit or inspection. Any audit conducted under this Section 8.1 shall be limited to Gather’s virtual premises (Gather does not have a physical business location). If the EU Standard Contractual Clauses apply, then nothing herein shall be construed as affecting any Supervisory Authority’s or data subject’s rights under the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. 

**8.2.** Gather will keep a record of any Processing of Personal Data it carries out on behalf of Customer, which it shall make available to the relevant Supervisory Authority on request, and which shall include: 

1. the name and contact details of Gather and of Customer on whose behalf it is acting, and where applicable, Customer’s representative and data protection officer; 
2. the categories of Processing carried out on behalf of Customer; 
3. transfers of Personal Data to a third country or international organization and the basis on which those transfers are compliant; and 
4. a description of data security measures taken by Gather. 

**9\. Sub-processors**
----------------------

You agree that we may engage Sub-processors to Process Personal Data on your behalf. We have currently appointed, as Sub-processors, the third parties listed in Annex 3 to this DPA. We will notify you if we add or replace any Sub-processors listed in Annex 3 at least 30 days prior to any such changes, if you opt-in to receive such email prior to any such changes by completing the form available [here.](https://hello.gather.town/sub-processors)

Where we engage Sub-processors, we will impose data protection terms on the Sub-processors that provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as those in this DPA (including, where appropriate, the Standard Contractual Clauses), to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub-processors. We will remain responsible for each Sub-processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-processor that cause us to breach any of its obligations under this DPA

Customer may object to Gather’s use of a new Sub-processor by notifying Gather promptly in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of Gather’s notice regarding the new Sub-processor. If Customer objects to the new Sub-processor, Gather will use reasonable efforts to make available a change in the Services or Customer’s use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the Sub-processor objected to by Customer. If Gather is unable to make available such change within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the notice from Customer, then Customer may terminate those Services which cannot be provided without the use of the objected to Sub-processor. If Customer terminates the Services, Gather will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term specified in the applicable ordering document following the effective date of termination. Notwithstanding anything provided herein, Customer acknowledges and agrees, that Gather may use the Sub-processors identified on Annex 3 to provide the Gather Services. Gather remains responsible for its Sub-processors and liable for their acts and omissions as for its own acts and omissions and any references to Gather’s obligations, acts and omissions in this Addendum shall be construed as referring also to Gather’s Sub-processors. The parties agree that any audit rights provided under the terms of this Addendum do not extend to Gather’s Sub-processors’ facilities. 

**10\. Data Protection Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Upon Customer’s request, Gather shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer with any data protection impact assessments, and prior consultations with supervisory authorities, which Customer reasonably considers to be required of Customer by Article 35 or 36 of the GDPR, in each case solely in relation to Processing of Personal Data by and taking into account the nature of the Processing and information available to, Gather.

**11\. Termination**
--------------------

**11.1** This Addendum shall continue in full force until the expiration or termination of the Agreement. 

**11.2** Upon the expiration or termination of the Agreement, Customer may extract Personal Data from the Gather Services. Within thirty (30) days from Customer’s deletion of a virtual space, Gather will delete Personal Data in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, except as may be required by law or, if permitted by applicable law, to resolve disputes or enforce Gather’s legal agreements and policies. 

**12\. CCPA Specific Provisions**
---------------------------------

**12.1** Gather is acting as a “Service Provider” on behalf of Customer, a “Business,” pursuant to the CCPA.  Gather will not retain, use or disclose Customer Data disclosed to it by Customer for any purpose other than the specific purpose of providing the Gather Services in accordance with the terms of the Agreement or as otherwise provided in the CCPA. 

**12.2** Gather will not sell any Customer Data to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.  

**12.3** Gather will not retain, use or disclose any Customer Data outside of the direct business relationship between Gather and Customer, except as may be provided in the CCPA. 

**13\. Miscellaneous**
----------------------

The parties do not anticipate the transfer of sensitive data as part of the Agreement. Each party’s liability arising out of or related to this Addendum, whether in contract, tort or under any theory of liability, is subject to the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the Agreement. If there is a conflict between any provision in this Addendum and any provision in the Agreement, this Addendum shall control. Except for changes made by this Addendum, the Agreement remains unchanged and in full force and effect. This Addendum shall not restrict any applicable Data Protection Laws. If any provision in this Addendum is ineffective or void, this shall not affect the remaining provisions.  The parties shall replace the ineffective or void provision with a lawful provision that reflects the business purpose of the ineffective or void provision. In case a necessary provision is missing, the parties shall add an appropriate one in good faith. In case of conflict, the order of precedence in respect of the Processing of Personal Data shall be this Addendum and then the Agreement. If the EU Standard Contractual Clauses are an integral part of this Addendum, then the EU Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail. This Addendum supersedes and replaces all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Addendum. This Addendum may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which taken together will be deemed to constitute one and the same document.

### **SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES**

**Clause 8**

_Data protection safeguards_

The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.

**8.1. Instructions**

(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.

(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.

**8.2. Purpose limitation**

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.

**8.3. Transparency**

On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

**8.4. Accuracy**

If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.

**8.5. Duration of processing and erasure or return of data**

Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).

**8.6. Security of processing**

(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organizational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorized to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.

(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.

**8.7   Sensitive data**

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.

**8.8   Onward transfers**

The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (4) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:

1. the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
2. the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
3. the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
4. the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.

Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.

**8.9   Documentation and compliance**

(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.

(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.

(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.

(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.

(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

**Clause 9**

_Use of Sub-processors_

(a) The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of Sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of Sub-processors at least **thirty (30) days** in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the Sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.

(b) Where the data importer engages a Sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. (8) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfills its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the Sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.

(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a Sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.

(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the Sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the Sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.

(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the Sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the Sub-processor contract and to instruct the Sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.

**Clause 10**

_Data subject rights_

(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorized to do so by the data exporter.

(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organizational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.

(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.

### **SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES**

**Clause 14**

_Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses_

(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorizing access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

1. the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;
2. the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorizing access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards (12);
3. any relevant contractual, technical or organizational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.

(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.

(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). 

(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfill its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organizational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

**Clause 15**

_Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities_

**15.1. Notification**

(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:

1. receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or
2. becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.

(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.

(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.). 

(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.

### **15.2. Review of legality and data minimisation**

(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).

(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. 

(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

### **SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS**

**Clause 16**

_Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination_

(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.

(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).

(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:

1. the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
2. the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
3. the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.

(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data.\] The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.

(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

**Clause 17**

_Governing law_

These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that these Clauses shall be governed in accordance with the 'Contracting Entity; Applicable Law; Notice’ section of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms or if such section does not specify an EU Member State, by the law of the Republic of Ireland (without reference to conflicts of law principles)

**Clause 18**

_Choice of forum and jurisdiction_

(a) Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.

(b) The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of Ireland.

(c) A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.

(d) The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.

UK AND SWISS ADDENDUM TO THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES

A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of any country in the UK. The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts”; and
