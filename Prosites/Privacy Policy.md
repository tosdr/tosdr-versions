_No Sale of Personal Information_

In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold and will not sell any personal information to non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We, also, have not and will not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age to non-affiliated third parties without affirmative authorization.

_Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Used, or Disclosed_

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use and disclosure of your Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will disclose to you: (1) the categories of Information we collected about you; (2) the categories of sources for the Information; (3) our business or commercial purpose for collecting or disclosing that Information; (4) the categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information; and (5) the specific pieces of Information we collected about you in the preceding 12 months.

_Right to Delete Personal Information Collected or Maintained_

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your request and verify your identity, we will permanently delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless a legal exception to deletion applies. In our response to your request to delete, we will specify the manner in which we have deleted your personal information or, if we must deny your deletion request, the basis for this refusal.

_Right to Non-Discrimination for Exercise of Privacy Rights_

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights by: (1) denying you goods or services; (2) charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; (3) providing you a different level or quality of goods or services; or (4) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

_Exercising Your Rights_

To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

* Calling us at 888-932-4500
* Visiting support@prosites.com

_Authorizing an Agent_

You may designate an authorized agent to submit your consumer request on your behalf, so long the authorized agent has your written permission to do so and you have taken steps to verify your identity directly with us.

_Verifying Your Request_

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

To verify your identity, we ask that you to provide us with the following information when you submit your request: (1) first name, (2) last name, and (3) phone number or email. We will use the above information to verify your identity. Depending on your type of request or the information requested by you, we may require additional information to verify your identity and fulfill your request.

California law also requires that we disclose how we respond to “do-not-track requests” from our users. At this time, we do not currently respond to “do-not-track” requests from our users’ browsers.

**Other Jurisdictions**

Regardless of the jurisdiction in which you reside, if you have registered an account, you can access and change your own personal information by contacting us at 888-932-3644.

If you request that we erase or forget your personal information, we will comply with your request to the extent permitted by law (sometimes other applicable laws require that we keep certain personal information). When we maintain personal information because of a legal requirement, the personal information will be used only for that purpose and maintained only for the amount of time required to comply with applicable law. You may also open a new account with a different email address at any time.
