The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Date. This Agreement can be extended by Customer by paying, in advance, the renewal fees in existence at the time of renewal, unless previously agreed upon through promotional offers. No termination or expiration of this Agreement shall abridge or deprive either party of any remedy it may have against the other party arising out of this Agreement or as a matter of law or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated by either party, upon written notice, if the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to cure that breach within fifteen (15) days of receipt of written notice thereof. With respect to “pre-designed” website styles for which no customization has been provided by ProSites, Customer is allowed a refund if notification is given to ProSites within 30 days of the Effective Start Date, net of any costs incurred by ProSites in the performance of services for Customer (e.g., domain name registrations and transfer fees, etc.). The Effective Start Date is the date Customer signs up for the subscription service and enters the site for creation of its website. There is no refund available for “custom designed” websites due to the nature of the labor intensive design services being rendered by ProSites.

### Miscellaneous:

This Agreement and the rights and obligations set forth herein may not be assigned, in whole or in part, by Customer without ProSites’ prior written consent. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including, without limitation, those relating to conflict of laws. Any lawsuit or action brought by any of the parties hereto, shall be filed and adjudicated in Riverside County, California. This Agreement may be amended only in a writing that has been executed by duly authorized officers of the parties and shall not be amended or deemed amended by subsequent conduct of either party or any course of dealings between the parties. The parties agree that (i) there shall be no oral agreements between the parties, whether or not related to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, and whether or not allegedly entered into prior, during or subsequent to the term hereof; and (ii) in order for any agreement to be effective between the parties, whether prior, during or subsequent to the term hereof, it shall be set forth in writing and executed by duly authorized representatives of the parties. If litigation occurs between the parties relating to this Agreement, and ProSites is the prevailing party, it shall be entitled to its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and costs of suit. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of or acquiescence in or to such provision. All notices given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or sent via receipted private courier or by United States Postal Service certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the address or addresses set forth in this Agreement, or to such other address as a party may notify the other party in writing. Any such notice shall be deemed to be properly given (i) if delivered personally, upon written acknowledgment of receipt after delivery to the address specified; or (ii) if sent by courier or posted, the earlier of the actual date of delivery or three (3) days from the date posted.

### Price and Payment:

The fees and charges agreed upon for the Services shall only apply up to the first year of the term of this Agreement. Thereafter, the fees and charges may be increased or decreased by ProSites’. Changes to fees are effective after we provide you with at least thirty days' (30) written notice. All fees are quoted in U.S. or Canadian Dollars, as applicable. Customer is responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with services in a timely manner with a valid payment method. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. (This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, retaining collection agencies and legal counsel.)

Bills are due and payable by Customer upon presentation. Recurring charges shall automatically be charged to a customer's payment method on file. By providing your preferred payment method, you understand that payment methods can be used by each of our entities in the event you purchase multiple products. By accepting these Terms of Use, Customer explicitly agrees to the recurring charges. Delinquent accounts are subject to deactivation at any time. Customer agrees payment is nonrefundable, except as provided in special promotions or as noted above. All annual subscription charges must be paid in advance (including renewals and upgrades, as provided). The Company may in its absolute discretion charge Customer interest on any account unpaid on the due date at a rate of 3% annually from the due date until the account is paid in full by Customer.

### ProSites ANTI-SPAM POLICY

ProSites prohibits the use of the Service in any manner associated with the transmission, distribution or delivery of any unsolicited bulk or unsolicited commercial email ("Spam").

You may not use the Service to send Spam. You also may not deliver Spam or cause Spam to be delivered to any of ProSites' Services or customers.

In addition, email sent, or caused to be sent, to or through the Service may not:

1. Use or contain invalid or forged headers;
2. Use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names;
3. Employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path;
4. Use other means of deceptive addressing;
5. Use a third party's internet domain name, or be relayed from or through a third party's equipment, without permission of the third party;
6. Contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content;
7. Fail to comply with additional technical standards described below; or
8. Otherwise violate the applicable Terms of Use for the Service.

ProSites does not authorize the harvesting, mining or collection of email addresses or other information from or through the Service. ProSites does not permit or authorize others to use the Service to collect, compile or obtain any information about ProSites’ customers or subscribers, including but not limited to subscriber email addresses, which are ProSites' confidential and proprietary information. Use of the Service is also subject to the applicable Privacy Statement and Terms of Use.

ProSites does not permit or authorize any attempt to use the Service in a manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair any aspect of any of the Service, or that could interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of any Service.

If ProSites believes that unauthorized or improper use is being made of any Service, it may, without notice, take such action as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, including blocking messages from a particular internet domain, mail server or IP address. ProSites may immediately terminate any account on any Service which it determines, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any email that violates this policy.

Nothing in this policy is intended to grant any right to transmit or send email to, or through, the Service. Failure to enforce this policy in every instance does not amount to a waiver of ProSites' rights.

Unauthorized use of the Service in connection with the transmission of unsolicited email, including the transmission of email in violation of this policy, may result in civil, criminal, or administrative penalties against the sender and those assisting the sender. [The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) establishes requirements for those who send commercial email, spells out penalties for spammers and companies whose products are advertised in spam if they violate the law, and gives consumers the right to ask emailers to stop spamming them.
