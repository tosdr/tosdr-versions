Virgin Pulse
============

### Wellness Membership Agreement

Last Updated: December 1, 2023

The Virgin Pulse program is a voluntary wellness program that encourages healthy lifestyle changes (the “**Program**”). The Program is paid for by your employer, your spouse’s employer or another organization interested in your health and wellbeing (the “**Program Sponsor**”) and operated by Virgin Pulse, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, headquartered at 75 Fountain Street, Providence, Rhode Island, 02902 (“**Virgin Pulse**”). The Program includes services we deliver through our website, our mobile application, Health Stations, Coaching Services, on-site events, and Program Partners (all capitalized terms as defined below).

This Membership Agreement (the “**Agreement**”) addresses the terms for becoming and being a “**Member**” of our Program and initiating your “**Membership**.” Please carefully read through this Agreement. To join the Program and enjoy the Virgin Pulse services and Program benefits you must create an account. By creating an account and checking the “I Agree” box you agree to all the provisions contained in this Agreement. Accessing our websites is also subject to additional terms contained in the Virgin Pulse website Terms of Use located at [https://www.virginpulse.com/terms-of-use/](https://www.virginpulse.com/terms-of-use/).

Virgin Pulse offers a number of wellness programs under different program names including Engage, Ignite, Core, and VP Go. This Agreement applies to all Virgin Pulse wellness programs unless there is an alternate Membership Agreement published specifically for that program.

Your Program Sponsor may elect to give you access to the Virgin Pulse Transform Program, as well.  In this Agreement, we provide a Transform Program summary that describes terms that differ from the Wellness Program rights and benefits.

Any rights not expressly granted to you by this Agreement are reserved by Virgin Pulse. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, all other provisions will remain unaffected. All provisions of this Agreement that relate to ownership of intellectual property, disclaimers, liability and restrictions on access and use of the Virgin Pulse platform will remain unaffected by the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

**What must I do to use the Program?**

In exchange for us providing you access to the Program; you agree to comply with the terms of this Membership Agreement and applicable law. Your rights and obligations as a Member are governed by this Agreement. By creating an account and becoming a Member you confirm that you are at least 18 years old, and you promise to abide by the terms of this Agreement. If you are 16 or 17 years old, your Sponsor may permit you to participate under the supervision of a parent, legal guardian, or other responsible adult. Please have your legal guardian complete our Legal Guardian Consent Form located at [https://form.jotform.com/221115473325043](https://form.jotform.com/221115473325043).

**What are my obligations regarding my honesty, accuracy and conduct?**

You agree to be honest and truthful in how you participate in the Program. You agree not to impersonate another member, including your spouse, or to allow anyone else to participate in the Program using your credentials. You agree that all the information you provide us with will be true, accurate and complete to the best of your knowledge, and you will continue to update this information on your Member profile as it changes. You agree that you will utilize the Program for its intended purpose and not modify or falsify your activity and fitness information or biometric and health information. You are fully and solely responsible for all activity on your account, including any inaccuracies in the information you share. We reserve the right to periodically review your activity information to safeguard against Program abnormalities and Program abuse. You agree to be respectful, non-discriminatory and non-abusive in all your interactions with the Program, including with fellow Members and our employees. If your activity information indicates there may be an abnormality or Program abuse, and we review and reasonably determine such abnormal or abusive action occurred, we reserve the right to take any and all corrective action, including but not limited to (i) sharing your activity information with your Program Sponsor, (ii) taking steps to remove, undo, or block the results of any abusive behavior, and/or (iii) making adjustments, suspending or terminating your account. If your conduct rises to the level of an illegal act, such as theft or fraud, we may engage law enforcement authorities and cooperate with their investigation.

**Will I have to pay to access the Program?**

Program fees are paid by your Program Sponsor. We do not require any credit card information to join or participate in the Program. We will not ask you to provide a credit card number or bank account information to redeem any rewards you have earned through the Program. If anyone contacts you claiming to be Virgin Pulse and asking for your credit card number or other payment information, please contact us at your earliest convenience.

You may choose to purchase certain products, or upgrade certain rewards, through our online store or when you are using one of our Program Partners. We, or our Program Partners, may need to collect a credit card payment, however, that will be your choice and we will only request credit card information when you directly initiate the transaction.

**How long is this Agreement valid?**

This Agreement becomes enforceable once you accept its terms and remains in effect until it is terminated when your account is cancelled.

**What are Program Partners?**

Your Program Sponsor may choose to enhance the Program by incorporating services from third parties (“**Program Partners**”). You may link to these Program Partners through our website or mobile application. If you choose a service provided by a Program Partner, we will transfer you to their website and it will be clear that you have transferred to a Program Partner. Each of the Program Partners will have their own terms of use and privacy notices that will govern how they provide you services. Your use of these Program Partners is voluntary and at your own discretion.

Some of these Program Partners may provide services that constitute medical care. We are not a licensed healthcare provider and do not represent that any of our services constitute medical care. Any of our Program Partners that provide medical care are independently responsible for their own activities, including appropriate licensure.

Some of these Program Partners may provide services that constitute financial services or advice. We are not a licensed financial provider and do not represent that any of our services constitute financial services or financial advice.

**What are Health Stations?**

Your Sponsor has the option to install “Health Stations.” Health Stations include a mobile device, such as a laptop or tablet, paired with a scale and blood pressure cuff. The Health Stations provide limited functionality. Members may use these stations to collect weight and blood pressure information for the Program. To use the Health Station, you must log in using your account information. You are responsible for logging out of the Health Station to protect your account. We do not guarantee the measurement devices are accurate. If you are concerned about your weight and blood pressure, please contact your health care provider.

Your Program Sponsor may terminate your Membership or the Program for any reason at any time, which will result in cancellation of your account.

We may terminate your account according to the terms of the honesty, accuracy and conduct terms explained above.

**What happens when an account is cancelled?**

If your account is cancelled, we will notify you that your Membership and this Agreement will terminate 62 days after the cancellation process has started.

Depending on the Reward, special terms and conditions may apply. If the Reward is redeemed from a Virgin Pulse reward partner, the reward partner return policy will apply.

**Are there rules of conduct for communicating with others in the Program?**

The Program includes a variety of ways that you may be able to communicate with other Members, coaches, and member support. Programs may include group chats, team communications, shout outs, blogs and other similar communication channels (“**Communication Channels**”). Whenever you communicate using any Communication Channels you agree to follow these engagement rules:

1. Respect other Members and avoid posting comments which are offensive to others. Material that is deemed as defamatory, discriminatory, racist, sexist or otherwise offensive is not welcome.
2. Avoid posting comments or stories that may be considered ‘spam’, including overly repetitive messages.
3. Only post content relevant to the spirit of the Program. We believe in freedom of expression, but you should be responsible and mature in your participation.
4. Keep in mind that posting any of the following types of comments is strictly prohibited and may be grounds for termination of your Membership and may be reported to your Program Sponsor, depending on the gravity of the circumstances:

a. comments that threaten, harass or bully another person;

b. personal or confidential information of anyone other than yourself;

c. sharing another Member’s personal information;

d. links that might be considered spam;

e. nudity, pornography or profanity;

f. misleading information;

g. deceptive conduct;

h. comments that encourage or incite violence; and

i. any content to which you do not own the intellectual property rights.

We are under no obligation to monitor or administer the Communication Channels features, however, we retain the right to delete any posts or comments that do not meet the above criteria, and take further action, as we deem necessary, to prevent future incidents. Please notify us if you think that another Member has violated these rules.

**Do you have any special considerations for texting?**

At this time, we only offer text messaging to individuals with mobile numbers located within the United States. In all programs, we specify how to unsubscribe and seek assistance. You may text STOP to stop messaging for that program and HELP for help. Text messages will be sent to your mobile number using an automatic dialing system. Message and data rates may apply. Text messaging may not be available via all carriers. You are responsible for providing us an accurate mobile phone number for communications, and for updating us if that mobile phone number changes. You are responsible for the security of your mobile phone, including activating passwords and enabling encryption to protect messages stored on the phone.

We do not guarantee the successful delivery of text messages by your wireless provider. Messages sent by text may not be delivered if the mobile device is not in range of a transmission site, or if sufficient network capacity is not available at a particular time. Even within a coverage area, factors beyond the control of wireless carriers may interfere with message delivery, including the terrain, proximity to buildings, foliage, weather, and the recipient’s equipment. We will not be liable for losses or damages arising from (a) non-delivery, delayed delivery, or misdirected delivery of a text message; (b) inaccurate or incomplete content in a text message; or (c) use or reliance on the content of any text message for any purpose.

While we attempt to limit the amount of sensitive information contained in text messages, these messages may include health information that is considered sensitive or protected under applicable data protection laws. Because we cannot encrypt text messages, there is a risk that this sensitive information could be intercepted or viewed by third parties, including others who have access to your device. When you choose to receive text messages from us, you do so at your own risk.

**What precautions should I take to participate in the Virgin Pulse Program?**

ALWAYS CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN BEFORE STARTING ANY EXERCISE PROGRAM. By enrolling and participating in the Program you certify that you are healthy and that your physical condition allows you to perform moderate to intense exercise. If you experience any physical symptoms such as abnormal or sudden blood pressure changes, fainting, dizziness, or irregular heartbeat or any other physical symptoms which seem abnormal to you while participating in the Program, stop exercising immediately and consult your doctor without delay. YOU SHOULD NEVER DISREGARD MEDICAL ADVICE OR DELAY IN SEEKING IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE LEARNED THROUGH YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM.

**Does Virgin Pulse provide medical advice?**

No. WE DO NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE. The information we provide is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. If you have any healthcare-related questions, please call or see your physician or other qualified health care provider without delay. We shall not be liable for any diagnostic or treatment decision made by you in reliance on any information provided by us through the Program. Should any unexpected medical event occur while you are participating in the Program, please seek medical advice, diagnosis or treatment without delay. Your reliance on any information made available through your participation in the Program is solely at your own risk.

As described above, some of our Program Partners may provide medical advice. These Program Partners will identify whether they are providing medical advice. You have the choice whether to engage with them based on your own needs and goals. Consider the advice of your current healthcare providers when engaging new healthcare providers.

**Does Virgin Pulse provide financial advice?**

No. WE DO NOT PROVIDE FINANCIAL ADVICE. Though there may be general information provided on financial topics as part of the Program, the information provided is not intended as advice for your particular financial circumstances. Everyone’s financial situation is different, and it is important that you consult with your own financial, tax and/or legal professionals before you take action.

As described above, some of our Program Partners may provide financial advice. These Program Partners will identify whether they are providing financial advice. You have the choice whether to engage with them based on your own needs and goals. We cannot guarantee the validity or soundness of any financial advice that a Program Partner offers.

**What should I do if I am not able to participate in all aspects of the Program?**

If you have a disability, whether temporary or permanent, that limits your participation in the Program, or if you have a medical condition that makes it unreasonably difficult (or medically inadvisable to attempt) to participate, you are still able to take part in the Program. Please contact Virgin Pulse Member Services to find out about alternative ways for you to participate in the Program, consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other applicable laws.

**How are Program errors and problems diagnosed and managed?**

From time to time, you may encounter a technical or other problem. In order to review and resolve these errors, we may need to access your Member account. You agree to make your Member account details available to us to allow us to diagnose and resolve the problem. Information about how to contact us is available on the Virgin Pulse website here: [https://virginpulse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us](https://virginpulse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

**What is Virgin Pulse’s liability?**

Our liability may vary based on your country of residence. Subject to the exceptions below, you agree that in no event shall we be liable to you for any business losses and any liability we may incur for losses you suffer arising from this Agreement shall not exceed $100 (USD) if you are a resident of the USA and is strictly limited to losses that were reasonably foreseeable.

You agree we will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under this Agreement that is caused by events outside our reasonable control.

_US and Canadian Residents_

Other than as expressly set out in this Agreement, Virgin Pulse does not make any specific promises about the Program, the services or goods made available to you. The Program, as well as all services and goods under this Agreement are provided “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS.” To the extent permitted by law, we expressly disclaim all warranties and conditions with respect to all equipment, software, goods and services, either express or implied or statutory, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

c)        for breach of any obligations implied by section 12 of the United Kingdom’s Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982;

d)       under Part I of the United Kingdom’s Consumer Protection Act 1987; or

e)        for any other liability that may not, by law, be limited or excluded.

_German Residents_

Our liability for damages arising out of death or personal injury due to actions of a Virgin Pulse legal representative or designated agent (“Erfüllungsgehilfe”) is unlimited. Our liability for damages arising from the lack of a guaranteed characteristic, or from gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud by a Virgin Pulse legal representative or designated agent is unlimited. Except in the cases outlined above, in the event of a slightly negligent breach of a contractual core duty we shall only be liable to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage. Contractual core duties are duties necessary for proper fulfillment of the contract, on which a party may reasonably rely on. Liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected. Insofar as German residents are affected, our sole liability and your sole remedy shall be pursuant to this clause.

**What is the applicable law and venue under this Agreement?**

If you are a resident of the USA, this Agreement is governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of Rhode Island. Any dispute between you and Virgin Pulse is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Rhode Island, other than for actions to enforce any order or judgment entered by such courts.

**What laws does Virgin Pulse comply with?**

We comply with any applicable laws and regulations based on the geographical location you select. You are asked to input your country and, if applicable state, of residence during enrollment. Please keep in mind that we do not independently track geographical location and we are unable to verify that information. Any discrepancy between your true residence and the information disclosed to us, and how that may affect the functionality of the platform, remains your responsibility.

**Is the Membership Agreement binding on me?**

You agree that your selection of an item, button, icon or other similar action, constitutes your signature as if actually signed by you in writing. By creating your account, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. We may update the terms of this Agreement from time to time. If we update these terms, you will be notified and required to review and accept these terms prior to being able to access the Program.
