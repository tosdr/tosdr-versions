6. **DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 5 above.

* Internal Third Parties: other companies in the ReklamStore Group acting as joint controllers or processors.
* External Third Parties including:
    * Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide services to us.
    * Regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only permit our service providers to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

7. **INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**

We share your personal data within the ReklamStore Group. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (**EEA**). In addition many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

* We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
* Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
* Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.

Please contact us at privacy@reklamstore.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

8. **CHILDREN**

We do not permit Services to be used to collect information from sites and apps directed to children aged 16 or under for purposes of creating interest-based profiles or serving ads based on users’ inferred interests. We may collect information from sites and apps directed to children aged 16 or under for other purposes, such as serving advertisements based on contextual information, like the content or type of the site or app (for example, serving an ad for a video game to a gaming app).

9. **DATA SECURITY**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes. We may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

10. **YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.

* **Request access to your personal data:** This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
* **Request correction of your personal data:** This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.
* **Request erasure of your personal data:** This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
* **Object to processing of your personal data:** Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
* **Request restriction of processing your personal data:** This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
* **Request transfer of your personal data:** To you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
* **Right to withdraw consent:** Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
* **Deletion of your account in the application**: If you want to request the deletion of your user account in the application, you can ensure the deletion of your account by sending an email titled ‘I Want to Delete My Account’ from the email address you registered with to info@reklamstore.com. In this case, your account and membership information will be deleted.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at privacy@reklamstore.com.

12. **CONTACT US**

If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to this Privacy Policy please feel free to contact us through our Website or by privacy@reklamstore.com.

**No fee usually required.** You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you.** We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond.** We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
