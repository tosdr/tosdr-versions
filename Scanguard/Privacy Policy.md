See '[Who we share your personal data with](#who-we-share-your-personal-data-with)' for further information on the steps we will take to protect your personal data where we need to share it with others.

#### Automated Decision-Making

Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We are allowed to use automated decision-making in the following circumstances:

* where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21 days to request us to reconsider the decision;
* for performing our contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights;
* in limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent and where appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights.

You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.

We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means, but we will notify you in writing if this position changes.

#### Marketing

We will use your personal data to send you updates (by email, text message, telephone or post) about our products and services including exclusive offers, promotions or new products and services.

We have a legitimate interest in using your personal data for marketing purposes (see above [How and why we use your personal data](#how-and-why-we-use-your-personal-data)' . This means we do not usually need your consent to send you marketing information. If we change our marketing approach in the future so that consent is needed, we will ask for this separately and clearly.

* access our [GDPR Form](https://www.scanguard.com/gdpr/restrict-processing-of-my-data).
* using the ‘unsubscribe’ link in emails or ‘STOP’ number in texts
* managing your preferences at [https://www.scanguard.com/unsubscribe](https://www.scanguard.com/unsubscribe).

We may ask you to confirm or update your marketing preferences if you ask us to provide further products and services in the future, or if there are changes in the law, regulation, or the structure of our business.

We will always treat your personal data with the utmost respect and never **share** it with other organisations for marketing purposes.

#### Who we share your personal data with

We routinely share personal data with:

* companies within Total Security
* third parties we use to help deliver our products and services to you, e.g. payment service providers, https://haveibeenpwned.com/;
* third party that assist us processing our mail, communicating with customers and prospective customers on our behalf (including via social media), running promotions, providing IT systems and administrative services and the development and improvement of internal systems and processes
* Other companies where we are trialling products and services which we consider may improve our offering to customers and/or our business processes;
* Other third parties where you have given your express **consent** or where we reasonably believe a third party is acting on your behalf.
* Our banks

We only allow those organisations to handle your personal data if we are satisfied they take appropriate measures to protect your personal data.

We or the third parties mentioned above occasionally also share personal data with:

* our and their external auditors, eg in relation to the audit of our or their accounts, in which case the recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations;
* our and their professional advisors (such as lawyers and other advisors), in which case the recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations;
* law enforcement agencies, courts, tribunals and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations;

The recipient of any of your personal data will be bound by confidentiality obligations.

#### Who we share your personal data with—in more detail

More details about who we share your personal data with and why are set out here [https://www.scanguard.com/third-party](https://www.scanguard.com/third-party).

#### Who we share your personal data with—further information

If you would like more information about who we share our data with and why, please contact us (see ‘How to contact us’ below).

#### Where your personal data is held

Personal data may be held at our offices and those of our group companies, third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described above (see above: '[Who we share your personal data with](#who-we-share-your-personal-data-with)').

Some of these third parties may be based outside the UK. For more information, including on how we safeguard your personal data when this happens, see below: '[Transferring your personal data out of the UK](#transferring-your-personal-data-out-of-the-UK)'

#### How long your personal data will be kept

We will not keep your personal data for longer than we need it for the purpose for which it is used.

Different retention periods apply for different types of personal data.

If you no longer have an account with us or we are no longer providing products and services to you, we will delete or anonymise your account data after seven years. We typically hold other data for two years.

Following the end of the of the relevant retention period, we will delete or anonymise your personal data.

#### Transferring your personal data out of the UK

Countries outside the UK have differing data protection laws, some of which may provide lower levels of protection of privacy.

It is sometimes necessary for us to transfer your personal data to countries outside the UK. In those cases we will comply with applicable UK laws designed to ensure the privacy of your personal data.

We will transfer your personal data to our service providers located outside the UK. Under data protection laws, we can only transfer your personal data to a country outside the UK where:

* in the case of transfers subject to UK data protection law, the UK government has decided the particular country ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data (known as an ‘**adequacy regulation**’) further to Article 45 of the UK GDPR. A list of countries the UK currently has adequacy regulations in relation to is available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en). We rely on adequacy regulations for transfers to the following countries: Isle of Man; New Zealand and Luxembourg.
* there are appropriate safeguards in place, together with enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for you; or
* a specific exception applies under relevant data protection law.

Where we transfer your personal data outside the UK, we do so on the basis of an adequacy regulation or (where this is not available) legally-approved standard data protection clauses recognised or issued further to Article 46(2) of the UK GDPR. In the event we cannot or choose not to continue to rely on either of those mechanisms at any time, we will not transfer your personal data outside the UK unless we can do so on the basis of an alternative mechanism or exception provided by UK data protection law and reflected in an update to this policy.

Any changes to the destinations to which we send personal data or in the transfer mechanisms we rely on to transfer personal data internationally will be notified to you in accordance with the section on '[Changes to this privacy policy](#changes-to-this-privacy-policy)' below.

#### International transfers of your personal data outside the UK—in more detail
