### **Refund policy**

**Return Policy and Money Back Guarantee:**
-------------------------------------------

**Supplements & Fitness Products**

All GOLO supplements and fitness products come with a 60-day money back guarantee. This money back guarantee is good for first time orders of a Product only and is limited to one return per customer per Product. The 60-day period begins on the day you receive the Product. If the Product you receive is damaged in shipping, you may return it for a full refund, or we will ship you a replacement Product.

**Return Authorization Process**

If you wish to make a return within the allotted timeframe, please contact us at 1-800-730-4656 and press Option 5 for customer support or send an email to [support@golo.com](mailto:support@golo.com), for a return authorization number and return instructions.  It is important that you contact us before returning any Product to ensure that you are eligible for a refund; returned items that are not eligible for a refund will not be processed and replacement product will not be shipped (or refund given) back to you. We reserve the right to forfeit the guarantee if we suspect any abuse of our money back guarantee offer.

**GOLO Perishable Foods**

GOLO guarantees the quality of our products and that you will receive your order in good condition. Since the GOLO Foods products are perishable, GOLO cannot accept returned food products or offer refunds. If your order arrives damaged, or is incorrect, GOLO will be happy to send a replacement order.  If your order is damaged or incorrect, please call GOLO at 800-730-4656 or email us at support@golo.com within five (5) days of the date you received your order.  GOLO may require you to provide photographic evidence or documentation for damaged or incorrect orders before any replacement is issued.

GOLO offers two (2) options in order to obtain a refund for one of our non-perishable food products :

1. GOLO Store Credit - If you choose this option, we will email you a credit equal to the value of the purchased item (see price list below). The credit can be used toward the purchase of any GOLO item online or ordered via telephone with Customer Service and is valid for 3 years from the issue date.
2. Donate - If you choose this option, simply donate the item(s) to your local food bank (or any other entity that accepts food donations) and obtain a receipt. Email the receipt to support@golo.com along with your order number. Once received, we will issue a full refund to your original form of payment. Find your local food bank [offsite on the Feeding America website here](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank)

* Olive Oil - $7.95
* Avocado Oil - $9.95
* Coconut Aminos - $4.95

**Return/Refund Process**
-------------------------

In order to receive a full refund when returning a product to GOLO, all items must be complete.  For example, if you are returning a GOLO® For Life Plan, all booklets must be included in your return along with any remaining supplements or if you are returning. If your return package is missing items, you still may receive a partial refund. However, if nothing is returned, a refund will not be issued. Your return must be postmarked within the time allotted on the return authorization instructions that are issued to you. Once a return is requested, your account will be deactivated, and you will no longer be able to access your GOLO account.

**Please note:** GOLO does not refund shipping costs paid. Packages that are returned within the 60-day timeframe but without a return authorization number and/or packages refused by the customer at the time of delivery will have a return fee deducted from the refund: Release® dietary supplements, GOLO® For Life Plans, and all other GOLO® products, including the AeroTrainer® exercise platform - $12.00 deduction. To ensure proper credit to your account, GOLO recommends that you obtain tracking information on your return package. Please save your shipping receipt until your refund has been received. Refunds are processed within 7 - 10 business days of receipt. Shipping costs are nonrefundable. Credits may take 48-72 hours to appear in your account once they have been processed. This timeframe is determined by your financial institution. Please refer to your financial institution for questions regarding this time frame. GOLO is not responsible for any bank or credit card fees that you may incur. Refunds issued by paper check will be sent via US mail. If you have further questions, please call 1-800-730-4656 and press Option 2 for customer support.  

**GOLO is not responsible for any items returned including where such return includes non-GOLO products.**

**Order Cancellation Requests**
-------------------------------

  

  

All orders are processed in our warehouse immediately after order placement and therefore cancellation requests may not always be accommodated. If we are not able to accommodate your request to cancel an order, the standard return procedure as noted above should be followed in order to receive a refund.

**Arbitration:**

Other than for the grounds set forth in the section below labeled “Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate”, in the event of any dispute, claim, question or disagreement arising from or relating to the Terms or the breach thereof, the parties hereto shall use reasonable efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement. To this effect, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not reach such solution within a period of thirty (30) days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, such dispute, claim, question or disagreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), subject to the limitations of this Section. This agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable under the prevailing law of any court having jurisdiction. Notice of a demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party hereto and with the AAA. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen, and in no event shall any such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The parties agree that one (1) arbitrator shall arbitrate the dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected by the joint agreement of the parties, but if they do not so agree within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice of a demand for arbitration referred to above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA from the panels of business arbitrators maintained by the AAA. The decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing and shall be final. Judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the decision shall not be subject to vacation, modification, or appeal, except to the extent permitted by Sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of which Sections the parties agree shall apply. The expenses of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the AAA, shall be shared equally by the parties.

The arbitrator will have no authority to award attorneys’ fees, punitive damages, or any other monetary relief not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages and each party irrevocably waives any claim thereto. The award may include equitable relief. The arbitrator will not make any ruling, finding, or award that does not otherwise conform to the Terms. The arbitrator may render a summary disposition relative to all or some of the issues, provided that the responding party has had an adequate opportunity to respond to any such application for such disposition.

The parties agree to treat all aspects of the arbitration as confidential, as provided in the AAA Rules. Before making any disclosure permitted by the Rules, a party shall give written notice to the other party and afford such party a reasonable opportunity to protect its interests. Further, judgment on the arbitrators’ award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. You and we agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to: (a) your or our intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); or (b) your violation of our User Content Posting Guidelines.

**Class Action Waiver: Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. You agree that neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity, and each party hereby waives any right to assert consolidated claims with respect to any disputes subject to arbitration under these Terms or any disputes between the parties. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.**

Governing Law. For all legal proceedings arising out of use of the Website, the Products, or our Services, and/or relating to these Terms, these Terms and the relationship between you and us shall, irrespective of any choice of laws rules, be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Subject to the Arbitration clause set forth above, you and we hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, or the court of competent jurisdiction closest thereto if no court of competent jurisdiction resides therein, and the parties’ consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and expressly waive any right they may otherwise have to cause any such action or proceeding to be brought or tried elsewhere. You and we irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that you may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceeding brought in any such court or any claim that a legal proceeding commenced in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

Assignment. You may not assign, convey, or transfer (whether by contract, merger or operation of law) (collectively, “assign” or variants) these Terms, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld by us in our sole discretion.

Survival.  Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration.

Headings. The headings of sections and paragraphs in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect its interpretation.

Waiver. The failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision shall not affect our right to exercise or enforce such right or provision at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

Severability. If any portion of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in such provision, and, notwithstanding such finding, the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. 

Notices. You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, by email to the address you provided at the time of registration or such changed address as you provide to us in your account data. Our address for notices is set forth below.
