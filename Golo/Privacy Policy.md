**Introduction and Scope**

GOLO, LLC ("**GOLO**", "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**") respects the privacy of our visitors, users, customers, and members (referred to as "**you**" or "**your**").

If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Platform, Products or Services.

**Personal Information We Collect** **and How We Collect It**

Personal Information is information that directly or indirectly identifies you or can be used to identify you as an individual. Personal Information does not include information publicly available from government records or information excluded by applicable law. Personal Information also does not include information that has been deidentified, pseudonymized, anonymized, aggregated, and/or otherwise processed so that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual in accordance with applicable laws ("**De-Identified Personal Information**").

The following are the categories of Personal Information we collect about you and how we collect it:

**_Information You Provide Us_**. We collect certain Personal Information you choose to provide when you visit or use the Platform, including via phone calls, texts, emails, mail, and user content posts. For example:

* Information that you provide by filling in webforms on our Website. This includes information provided when creating an online account, purchasing our Products or Services, subscribing to our e-newsletters or other communications, requesting information from us, submitting or posting material (where permitted) on our forums, or interacting with customer support or service, report a problem with our Website, products, or Services, or otherwise communicating with us.
* You may share your name, email, address, and other contact information when you establish an account with us, as well as payment or billing information when you complete a transaction.
* Information you provide when you email, call, use our customer services or support features, or otherwise contact us.

* Your responses to surveys that we or our service providers might ask you to complete for research purposes or answers to questionnaires on our Website to help us customize recommendations to you.
* Information you share to participate in our loyalty/rewards programs.

* Feedback, photos or other testimonial or review information you choose to share.

**_Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies_**.  As you navigate through and interact with the Platform, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, and other online activities. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include cookies, local storage cookies, web beacons, pixel tracking, GIF, and/or IP address. Each of these is discussed below.

_Cookies (or browser cookies)_. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device. It may contain certain data, including, but not limited to: the name of the server that has placed it there, an identifier in the form of a unique number, and, an expiration date (some cookies only). Cookies are managed by the web browser on your computer or mobile device (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, etc.). We also use cookies to implement tracking technology on our Platform. This allows us to display advertising that is tailored to you on our Platform which parts of our content interest you the most and which Service categories you request. Some of our service providers are allowed to place cookies on our Website. Those companies may also provide you with the option of preventing the use of cookies in the future. For more information, contact the relevant third-party provider. It is possible that you will also come across third-party cookies on some pages of sites that are not under our control, please refer to the section below on Links to Third-Party Sites for information on those activities. We may also use cookies to track whether you open emails we send to you.

_Web Beacons_. Pages of our Website and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

_Pixel Tracking_. In addition to using Cookies, the Website may employ "pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our products, services, and offers with your interests and needs. For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you to the Website. If you visit our Website, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing, research, and other activities.

_GIF_. We may use tiny images known as clear GIFs to track behavior of users, including statistics on who opens our emails.

_Log Files_. Our servers (or those of our service providers) may automatically record certain log file information reported from your browser when you access the Website. These server logs may include information such as which pages of the Website you visited, your internet protocol ("IP") address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Website. These log files are generally deleted periodically.

The information we collect using online tracking technologies may include:

* Usage Data: Details of your visits to our Website or use of the Mobile App, including, but not limited to, website traffic data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website or Mobile App.
* Device Information: Information about your computer, mobile device, and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, browser type, clickstream patterns, the URL of the most recent website you visited before coming to our Website, the amount of time you spent on our Website or using the Mobile App, and the pages you viewed while on our Website.
* Location Data: We collect and use IP address and mailing address for marketing purposes, e.g., to set parameters for different types of communications based on geographic information (such as zip code). Our marketing or advertising service providers may use location data (via IP address) to automatically display advertising on your device based on where you are at a point in time in relation to a particular location (for example, a shopping mall). We do not store your momentary geolocation data (i.e., time or precise place), though various third parties such as Google or Waze may for their own purposes, if you have given them permission to do so.
* Behavioral Tracking: We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services, or associate Personal Information with other information collected in this manner.
* Keystrokes: We or our service providers may keep track of and/or collect the keystrokes, mouse clicks, and cursor movements of Website visitors and Mobile App users before purchase of a Product or Service from our Website (and before we have any email address or other information about you (other than IP address) which would specifically identify you). If you sign up to receive our emails (e.g., through a popup box that appears) we then do have the ability going forward to associate the keystroke and cursor information with the email address you provide. We use this information for the purpose of improving our Website, Mobile App, Products, and Services, and to improve our customers' user experience.
* Analytics Data: The Site also uses analytics tools such as Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. that uses cookies to help us analyze how users navigate the Site. The information generated by this tool (including IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google in aggregate form and used to evaluate use of the Site, compile reports on Site activity and other services relating to Site usage. You can learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**_Information We Collect from Third Parties_**. We may collect information that others provide about you when you use the Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Platform. For example:

* _Third Party Services_. If you link, connect, or login to your account with a third-party social media service (e.g., Facebook, Google, Instagram, Yelp, etc.), the third-party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.
* _Other Sources_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third-party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.

**Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website or Mobile App are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. First party or third-party cookies may be used alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website or Mobile App. The information that first party and third-party cookies collect may be associated with your Personal Information or they may collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services (i.e., tracking such activities). They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content about our products.

**Managing and Opting Out of Online Tracking**

You can adjust the settings on your browser to block or opt out of certain cookies and other online tracking, including those used for targeted or cross-contextual advertising. To manage your settings, visit the "[Your Privacy Choices](https://www.golo.com/pages/cookie-preferences)" link at the footer of our Website or Platform and select the "[Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](https://www.golo.com/pages/cookie-preferences)" button to adjust the online tracking preferences. You can also find out more about cookies and how to manage them by visiting www.AboutCookies.org.

**Do-Not-Track Signals**

Some browsers have a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity online tracking technologies. While we continue to evaluate this evolving technology, our Website does not currently respond to browser-based DNT signals. For information regarding DNT and how to enable this setting, if available, on your devices please see [https://allaboutdnt.com](https://allaboutdnt.com/).
