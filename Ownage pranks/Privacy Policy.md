TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT
--------------------------

### The Effective Date of this Agreement is August 25th, 2024

Welcome to Ownage Prank’s hub, which is accessible via the Ownage Pranks App (the “App”) as well as through www.ownagepranks.com (the “Site”)

By using or visiting any content accessible through the App, the Site, other related applications or sites (collectively, the “Service”) you confirm you agree to be bound by this Agreement. Ownage Labs Inc. and any affiliated entities (hereby referred to as "Ownage Labs", "we", "us" and "our") provides the Service to you (the "user", "you", and "your", as applicable) only for your personal use and subject to your acceptance of and compliance with this Terms of Service Agreement (the “Agreement” and its “Terms”) and acknowledgement of our [Privacy Policy](#privacy) below.

Please read the terms contained in this Agreement carefully before using this Site and our Services. Please note that these terms include, but are not limited to, a limit on and exclusion of damages and remedies available to you, and the selection of a choice of law and jurisdiction you may not live in to resolve any disputes arising out of this Agreement.

Your use of the Site and the associated Services confirms that you have read and understood this Agreement and you unconditionally accept this Agreement. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not use the Services.

By accepting of this Agreement, you warrant that you are an adult of the age of majority in your jurisdiction required to enter into an agreement or your parents or legal guardians have entered into this Agreement as individuals and are now bound by this Agreement. Ownage Labs may take steps to limit or fully restrict certain users depending on age. Some of those restrictions are described in this Agreement.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to revise this Agreement at any time. Any changes to these terms will be included in a revised version of this Agreement accessible through the Site. Your use of the Site and any related services following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes your unconditional acceptance and agreement to be bound by the changed terms.

END USER LICENSE
----------------

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Ownage Labs grants you a limited nonexclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable license to download and install a copy of the App on a mobile device and to run such copy of the App solely for your own personal, noncommercial purposes. This license does not give you any title or ownership in the Service, or Ownage Labs’s scripts. This license should not be construed as a sale or transfer of any intellectual property rights to the App, Service or scripts. Ownage Labs reserves all rights in and to the Service and all of its related content not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

The grant of this license is not, and shall not be construed as, a grant of any right to you to use, receive or view, copies of source code, schematics, master copies, design materials related to the App.  Without limiting the foregoing, you shall have no rights to receive any source code for the App and shall not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source code for the App for any purpose.

NOTICES TO USERS: 
------------------

RECORDING OTHERS USING THE APP MAY BE ILLEGAL IN YOUR STATE OR COUNTRY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This Service offers a feature enabling users to record others during a call. Depending on the state or country in which you are located or the person you are calling is located, [you may violate a state’s](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1050-scope-18-usc-2511-prohibitions) or country’s law by listening in on or recording a telephone conversation without informing them. You may not—and represent and warrant you have/will not—use the recording capability of the Service unless you have determined that your use is legal each time you use the feature.

Before recording any call, you must check the laws of your state and the laws of any state in which a person you are calling is located in order to determine if you need the other party's permission to record a call. Even if your state only requires the permission of one party, you should be aware that it is possible to make calls to or receive calls from people located in states that require the permission of both parties to record a call. If you record such a call without the knowledge and permission of the other person, you may be subject to criminal prosecution in the other state.

You must also confirm that phone number you are calling is not on the national [“Do Not Call” registry](https://www.donotcall.gov/) or any similar “do not call” list.

CERTAIN NUMBERS ARE FULLY RESTRICTED FROM CALLING
-------------------------------------------------

You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call emergency lines, health care facilities, government agencies, employees or officials, law enforcement, schools, numbers assigned to radio common carrier services, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call. Calling one of these entities shall result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and may possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.

YOU MAY CALL ONLY PEOPLE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY
--------------------------------------------

You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call anyone you have not had a personal interaction with. Although the scripts are often cartoonish and often outlandish, some of the scripts may be scary or misleading to people who may not be expecting these calls or who cannot get a personal, friendly explanation about the nature of the call. We’ve therefore chosen to require you to call only to people who you know personally and by using the Services you represent and warrant that you will adhere to this restriction. Calling strangers can result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and would possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.

YOU GRANT PERMISSION FOR US TO CALL YOU AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE PEOPLE YOU CALL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By registering your number through the App, you grant us permission to call the phone number you provided at registration. You represent and warrant that any numbers you have called using the App meet the guidelines of this Agreement and assent to us calling or following up with any of those phone numbers you have called using the App.

We may choose to contact you to audit a call you have made or contact a person you have called to ensure that your use of the Services complies with this Agreement.

THIS APP CANNOT BE USED FOR AUTODIALING AND ROBOCALLS
-----------------------------------------------------

We take telecommunications regulations very seriously and have call limits, manual dialing restrictions, and other limitations in place to prevent the Services being used as an auto-dialer or a robocalling platform. Any attempts to use the Services in an automated nature shall result in immediate termination of your account and may result in civil or criminal penalties.

THIS APP USES CELEBRITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL IMPERSONATORS
--------------------------------------------------------

Certain scripts available through the Service are voiced by celebrity impersonators or may seem to impersonate real organizations. This Service is not affiliated with, maintained, authorized, endorsed or sponsored by any of the impersonated celebrities or any of their affiliates. You may not post or share Content suggesting that an impersonated celebrity or organization is, in fact, the real celebrity or organization.

OWNAGE LABS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TAKE DOWN ANY USER-GENERATED CONTENT

NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURE FOR COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS
------------------------------------------------------

It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to Ownage Labs as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.  
  
It is expected that all users of any part of Ownage Labs will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if Ownage Labs receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.  
  
If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.

### Designated Agent

Ownage Labs’s Designated Agent to receive notification of alleged infringement under the DMCA can be contacted [via this form.](https://www.ownagepranks.com/contact-us/) Upon receipt of proper notification of claimed infringement, Ownage Labs will follow the procedures outlined herein and in the DMCA.

### Infringement Notification

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide Ownage Labs's Agent (listed above) the following information in a written communication:

1. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

4. The following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law";
5. The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate, and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed"; and
6. A physical or electronic signature of the owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyrights.

### Counter Notification

A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To file a counter notification with us, please provide Ownage Labs's Agent (listed above) the following information in a written communication (preferably via email):

1. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
2. Your name, address, and telephone number;
3. The following statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the \[insert the federal judicial district in which your address is located\]";
4. The following statement: "I will accept service of process from \[insert the name of the person who submitted the infringement notification\] or his/her agent";
5. The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the affected material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled"; and
6. Your signature, in physical or electronic form.

Upon receipt of such counter notification, Ownage Labs will promptly provide the person who provided the original infringement notification with a copy of the counter notification and inform that person that Ownage Labs will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days. Ownage Labs will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original infringement notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system or network.

### Repeat Infringers

In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, Ownage Labs will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.

### Accommodation of Standard Technical Measures

It is Ownage Labs's policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works that Ownage Labs determines are reasonable under the circumstances.

VIRTUAL MONEY AND GOODS
-----------------------

The Service may permit the purchase of virtual currency, such as credits, points, and gems (“Virtual Money”), and use of that Virtual Money to purchase virtual object or services (“Virtual Goods”). Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are collectively referred to as “Virtual Items.”

### License to Virtual Items

Your purchase of Virtual Money grants you only a limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Virtual Money to access and purchase Virtual Goods in conjunction with your personal, noncommercial use of the Service.

### No Ownership

You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in or to the Virtual Items. Any balance of Virtual Items does not reflect any stored value. You agree that Virtual Items have no monetary value and do not constitute actual currency or property of any type. Virtual Money may be redeemed only for Virtual Goods and can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for “real” money, “real” goods, or “real” services from us or anyone else. 

### Only Obtain Virtual Items Through Official Channels

You agree that you will only obtain Virtual Items from us and through means provided by us, and not from any third-party platform, exchange, broker, or other mechanism, unless expressly authorized. Once you acquire a license to Virtual Items, you may not trade or transfer the Virtual Items to another individual or account, unless such functionality is provided to you by us by way of a feature or service, whether inside the Service or through some other method (e.g., a third-party website we authorize). We may cancel any Virtual Item  sold, transferred, or exchanged in violation of this Agreement. Any such sale, transfer, or exchange (or attempt to do so) is prohibited and may result in the termination of your account.

### Redemption and Pricing of Virtual Items

During the term of your license to your Virtual Money, you have the option to redeem your Virtual Money for selected Virtual Goods. Pricing and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right at any time to change and update our pricing and inventory of Virtual Items. All Virtual Items are provided “as is,” without any warranty. You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Items are final and that we will not permit exchanges or refunds for any unused Items once the transaction has been made.

### Purchases by End Users Outside the U.S.

Virtual Items may only be purchased and held by legal residents of countries where access to and use of the Service are permitted. If you live in the European Union, you have certain rights to withdraw from online purchases. However, please note that once you download Virtual Money from us, your right of withdrawal ends. You agree that (a) purchase of Virtual Money involves immediate download of such Content; and (b) you lose your right of withdrawal once your purchase is complete. If you live in the European Union, you will need to ensure your compliance with VAT when required to do so by law. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format. We reserve the right to control, regulate, change, or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.

### Suspension or Cancellation

We may cancel, suspend, or terminate your account and your access to your Virtual Items, in our sole discretion and without prior notice, in situations including, but not limited to, if (a) your account is inactive (i.e., not used or logged into); (b) you fail to comply with this Agreement; (c ) we suspect fraud or misuse by you of Virtual Items; (d) we suspect any other unlawful activity associated with your account; or (e) we are acting to protect the Service, our systems, any of our users, or our reputation. We have no obligation or responsibility to, and will not reimburse or refund, you for any Virtual Items lost due to such cancellation, suspension, or termination. You acknowledge that Ownage Labs is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items when your account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary. In the case Ownage Labs cancels your account, Ownage Labs will not be required to provide you with prior notice or explanation in respect of such action. Notwithstanding the cancellation of access to your account in any case, you agree you will remain fully liable for any outstanding liability owed to Ownage Labs. Ownage Labs may, where it believes such action is necessary, without notice block IP addresses of any users who Ownage Labs believes have breached that Agreement.

### Modifications

We have the right to offer, modify, eliminate, and/or terminate Virtual Items, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice or liability to you. If we discontinue the use of Virtual Items entirely, then we will provide notice to you by posting a notice on the Service or through other communications.

### Notice to Parents

The Services are not intended for use by children under age 13 or persons who have not reached the age of majority under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.  Some on-Site content, functionality and actions are available only by purchasing of Virtual Items.  If you are a parent, legal guardian and other adult responsible for children in your care, you are fully responsible for any use of your credit card or other payment instrument by the children in your care.   Parents and other adults who provide our Software to their children, children in their care or other adults should take precautions to prevent unintended purchases of Virtual Items. Aside from any refund obligations we may be required to honor from the platform the Software is distributed through, we accept ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS on any Virtual Items purchases including those made by children in your care.

### Taxes on Virtual Items

When you purchase a license to use our Virtual Items, you agree to pay taxes that we or our distribution platform assesses on your purchase. Depending on the jurisdiction, the price may or may not include any applicable VAT.

### Incorrect Pricing on Virtual Items

If the price or specification published is materially incorrect when you place an order for the Virtual Items those incorrect prices may be honored at our sole discretion.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
------------------

For any dispute you have with Ownage Labs, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally by contacting us through [this form](https://www.ownagepranks.com/complaints/). At the commencement of the dispute resolution process, the parties shall exchange written statements of position and shall provide documents that they believe support their position.  The informal dispute resolution process shall be pursued for a period not less than sixty (60) days. In the unlikely event that Ownage Labs is not able to resolve a dispute after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”) through binding arbitration.

Unless you and Ownage Labs agreed otherwise, arbitration will be conducted in Arlington, VA by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) and you waive all objections, including without limitation all objections based on convenience and/or cost, to such location. Subject to AAA Rules available at https://www.adr.org/Rules, each party will be responsible for its own expenses and costs of arbitration, including payment of any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. For avoidance of doubt, if there are one or more disputed items that remain unresolved at the end of the arbitration, the arbitrator will render a final and binding decision on those unresolved items. The arbitrator's decisions shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the courts for matters related to intellectual property rights or unauthorized access to or use of the Service.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OWNAGE LABS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL, INCLUDING ANY PARTICIPATION IN A CLASS ACTION OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CLAIMANT. YOU AND OWNAGE LABS ARE INSTEAD ELECTING TO HAVE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED THIS AGREEMENT.

* Contact Us: Subject to the Privacy Rights Section below, you may contact us to access, update or delete your personal information by contacting us [here](https://www.ownagepranks.com/contact-us/).

### PRIVACY RIGHTS

Depending on where you are located, you may have certain rights regarding your Personal Information. Residents of certain jurisdictions may access, correct, update, or delete your personal information; object to our processing of this information, ask us to restrict our processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information. Please review the information within this section to learn more about exercising your rights.

Upon request, Ownage Labs will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information. If you submit a request to access all personal information you’ve submitted, we will respond to your request to access within 30 days or as otherwise required by law.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your requests for deletion; however, certain residual information may actively persist on the Service even if you close your account. In addition, the rights described above may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information, we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as for fraud prevention purposes). Your Personal Information may remain in our archives and information you update or delete, or information within a closed account, may persist internally for our administrative purposes, to the extent permitted by law. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete information from our databases. In addition, we typically will not remove information you posted publicly through or on the Service. Bear in mind that neither you nor Ownage Labs can delete all copies of information that has been previously shared with others on the Service. If your information is deleted, then your account may become deactivated. If your account is deactivated or you ask to close your account, you will no longer be able to use the Services. 

Please note that our Services require a minimum amount of Personal Information in order to function. Individuals who do not provide Personal Information (e.g., by not creating an account) may not be able to access the full functionality of features found on Ownage Labs. 

### European Residents

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Ownage Labs may be considered a data controller to the extent that we process personal information directly from European residents. To the extent that Ownage Labs is a data controller, European residents may access, correct, update or delete your personal information; object to our processing of this information, ask us to restrict our processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information by accessing the account settings within the App or by contacting us [here.](https://www.ownagepranks.com/contact-us/)

### U.S. Residents

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights over your personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act / California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA/CPRA”) may provide you with additional privacy rights with respect to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. To the extent that Ownage Labs is a covered business under state laws, you may contact us for more information regarding the following rights:

* The right to know what Personal information we have collected and how we have used and disclosed that Personal Information in the 12-month period preceding your request.
    * Please see the above section within this Policy titled INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT IT, to see the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you.
    * Please see the above sections within this Policy titled HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION and HOW WE DISCLOSE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION, to see applicable use and disclosures of your Personal Information.
* The right to request deletion of your Personal Information.
* The right to be free from discrimination related to the exercise of any of your privacy rights. 
* The right to opt out of the sale of your personal information, and to request information about whether we have sold your personal information in the past 12 months. 
    * Ownage Labs does not currently sell personal information to third parties, and we have not done so in the last year. If this changes and we commence the sale of personal information, we will update this section accordingly, and you will be able to opt-out of the sale of personal information by submitting an opt-out request [here.](https://www.ownagepranks.com/contact-us/)

For more information on how to exercise your rights, please contact us [here](https://www.ownagepranks.com/contact-us/). Please note that we may require you to verify your credentials, by matching your e-mail address, or other account information to the information in our systems, before you can submit a request to exercise any of these rights.
