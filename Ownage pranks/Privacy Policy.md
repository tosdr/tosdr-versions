Welcome to Ownage Prank’s hub, which is accessible via the Ownage Pranks App (the “**App**”) as well as through www.ownagepranks.com (the “**Site**”)

  

By using or visiting any content accessible through the App, the Site, other related applications or sites (collectively, the “**Service**”) you confirm you agree to be bound by this Agreement. OP Media Group LLC, its affiliates as well as third parties associated with OP Media Group LLC, including but not limited to Ownage Labs and the App’s developers shall be referred to as **"OP Media", "we", "us"** and **"our",** as applicable. OP Media provides the Service to you (the **"user", "you",** and **"your",** as applicable) only for your personal use and subject to your acceptance of and compliance with this Terms of Service Agreement (the “**Agreement**” and its “**Terms**”) and acknowledgement of our [Privacy Policy](#privacy) below.

END USER LICENSE
----------------

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, OP Media grants you a limited nonexclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable license to download and install a copy of the App on a mobile device and to run such copy of the App solely for your own personal, noncommercial purposes. This license does not give you any title or ownership in the Service, or OP Media’s scripts. This license should not be construed as a sale or transfer of any intellectual property rights to the App, Service or scripts. OP Media reserves all rights in and to the Service and all of its related content not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.

The grant of this license is not, and shall not be construed as, a grant of any right to you to use, receive or view, copies of source code, schematics, master copies, design materials related to the App.  Without limiting the foregoing, you shall have no rights to receive any source code for the App and shall not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source code for the App for any purpose.

NOTICES TO USERS:
-----------------

RECORDING OTHERS USING THE APP MAY BE ILLEGAL IN YOUR STATE OR COUNTRY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This Service offers a feature enabling users to record others during a call. Depending on the state or country in which you are located **or** the person you are calling is located, [you may violate a state’s](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1050-scope-18-usc-2511-prohibitions) or country’s law by listening in on or recording a telephone conversation without informing them. You may not—and represent and warrant you have/will not—use the recording capability of the Service unless you have determined that your use is legal each time you use the feature.

Before recording any call, you must check the laws of your state and the laws of any state in which a person you are calling is located in order to determine if you need the other party's permission to record a call. Even if your state only requires the permission of one party, you should be aware that it is possible to make calls to or receive calls from people located in states that require the permission of both parties to record a call. If you record such a call without the knowledge and permission of the other person, you may be subject to criminal prosecution in the other state.

You must also confirm that phone number you are calling is not on the national [“Do Not Call” registry](https://www.donotcall.gov/) or any similar “do not call” list.

CERTAIN NUMBERS ARE FULLY RESTRICTED FROM CALLING
-------------------------------------------------

You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call emergency lines, health care facilities, government agencies, employees or officials, law enforcement, schools, numbers assigned to radio common carrier services, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call. Calling one of these entities shall result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and may possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.

YOU MAY CALL ONLY PEOPLE YOU KNOW PERSONALLY
--------------------------------------------

You are strictly prohibited from using the App to call anyone you have not had a personal interaction with. Although the scripts are often cartoonish and often outlandish, some of the scripts may be scary or misleading to people who may not be expecting these calls or who cannot get a personal, friendly explanation about the nature of the call. We’ve therefore chosen to require you to call only to people who you know personally and by using the Services you represent and warrant that you will adhere to this restriction. Calling strangers can result in immediate termination of your account, if found, and would possibly make you subject to criminal or civil prosecution.

YOU GRANT PERMISSION FOR US TO CALL YOU AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE PEOPLE YOU CALL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By registering your number through the App, you grant us permission to call the phone number you provided at registration. You represent and warrant that any numbers you have called using the App meet the guidelines of this Agreement and assent to us calling or following up with any of those phone numbers you have called using the App.

We may choose contact you to audit a call you have made or contact a person you have called to ensure that your use of the Services complies with this Agreement.

THIS APP CANNOT BE USED FOR AUTODIALING AND ROBOCALLS
-----------------------------------------------------

We take telecommunications regulations very seriously and have call limits, manual dialing restrictions, and other limitations in place to prevent the Services being used as an auto-dialer or a robocalling platform. Any attempts to use the Services in an automated nature shall result in immediate termination of your account and may result in civil or criminal penalties.

THIS APP USES CELEBRITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL IMPERSONATORS
--------------------------------------------------------

Certain scripts available through the Service are voiced by celebrity impersonators or may seem to impersonate real organizations. This Service is not affiliated with, maintained, authorized, endorsed or sponsored by any of the impersonated celebrities or any of their affiliates. You may not post or share Content suggesting that an impersonated celebrity or organization is, in fact, the real celebrity or organization.

TERMS RELATED TO TELESWAP PARTINERSHIP
--------------------------------------

The Service, through a partnership with Teleswap, may allow users to make calls via an obfuscated number (the “Feature”). This Feature is governed by all the terms in this Agreement as well as these additional terms in this section.

You represent and warrant that you have not and will not use this Feature for commercial purposes. Using the Feature in connection with telemarketing or debt-collection, for example, may be a violation of the law as well as a violation of these terms.

You may not use the Services to commit fraud or make misrepresentations even if those misrepresentations do not arise to the level of a legal violation. This feature should currently only be used to call phone numbers in the United States. The FTC governs fraudulent activity related to callers disguising their identity: should a user use the Feature to engage in fraud, the Service reserves the right to use the data it retains from the Feature to assist in any investigation.

OP MEDIA RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TAKE DOWN ANY USER-GENERATED CONTENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURE FOR COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS
------------------------------------------------------

It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to OP Media as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.  
  
It is expected that all users of any part of OP Media will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if OP Media receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.  
  
If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.

### Designated Agent

Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyrights.

### Counter Notification

A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To file a counter notification with us, please provide OP Media's Agent (listed above) the following information in a written communication (preferably via email):

1. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
2. Your name, address, and telephone number;

OP Media will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original infringement notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system or network.

### Repeat Infringers

In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, OP Media will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.

### Accommodation of Standard Technical Measures

It is OP Media's policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works that OP Media determines are reasonable under the circumstances.

VIRTUAL MONEY AND GOODS
-----------------------

The Service may permit the purchase of virtual currency, such as credits, points, and gems (“Virtual Money”), and use of that Virtual Money to purchase virtual object or services (“Virtual Goods”). Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are collectively referred to as “Virtual Items.”

License to Virtual Items. Your purchase of Virtual Money grants you only a limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Virtual Money to access and purchase Virtual Goods in conjunction with your personal, noncommercial use of the Service.

No ownership. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in or to the Virtual Items. Any balance of Virtual Items does not reflect any stored value. You agree that Virtual Items have no monetary value and do not constitute actual currency or property of any type. Virtual Money may be redeemed only for Virtual Goods and can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for “real” money, “real” goods, or “real” services from us or anyone else. 

Only obtain Virtual Items through official channels. You agree that you will only obtain Virtual Items from us and through means provided by us, and not from any third-party platform, exchange, broker, or other mechanism, unless expressly authorized. Once you acquire a license to Virtual Items, you may not trade or transfer the Virtual Items to another individual or account, unless such functionality is provided to you by us by way of a feature or service, whether inside the Service or through some other method (e.g., a third-party website we authorize). We may cancel any Virtual Item  sold, transferred, or exchanged in violation of this Agreement. Any such sale, transfer, or exchange (or attempt to do so) is prohibited and may result in the termination of your account.

Redemption and pricing of Virtual Items. During the term of your license to your Virtual Money, you have the option to redeem your Virtual Money for selected Virtual Goods. Pricing and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right at any time to change and update our pricing and inventory of Virtual Items. All Virtual Items are provided “as is,” without any warranty. You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Items are final and that we will not permit exchanges or refunds for any unused Items once the transaction has been made.

Purchases by End Users Outside the U.S. Virtual Items may only be purchased and held by legal residents of countries where access to and use of the Service are permitted. If you live in the European Union, you have certain rights to withdraw from online purchases. However, please note that once you download Virtual Money from us, your right of withdrawal ends. You agree that (a) purchase of Virtual Money involves immediate download of such Content; and (b) you lose your right of withdrawal once your purchase is complete. If you live in the European Union, you will need to ensure your compliance with VAT when required to do so by law. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format. We reserve the right to control, regulate, change, or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.

Suspension or cancellation. We may cancel, suspend, or terminate your account and your access to your Virtual Items, in our sole discretion and without prior notice, in situations including, but not limited to, if (a) your account is inactive (i.e., not used or logged into); (b) you fail to comply with this Agreement; (c ) we suspect fraud or misuse by you of Virtual Items; (d) we suspect any other unlawful activity associated with your account; or (e) we are acting to protect the Service, our systems, any of our users, or our reputation. We have no obligation or responsibility to, and will not reimburse or refund, you for any Virtual Items lost due to such cancellation, suspension, or termination. You acknowledge that OP Media is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items when your account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary. In the case OP Media cancels your account, OP Media will not be required to provide you with prior notice or explanation in respect of such action. Notwithstanding the cancellation of access to your account in any case, you agree you will remain fully liable for any outstanding liability owed to OP Media. OP Media may, where it believes such action is necessary, without notice block IP addresses of any users who OP Media believes have breached that Agreement.

Modifications. We have the right to offer, modify, eliminate, and/or terminate Virtual Items, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice or liability to you. If we discontinue the use of Virtual Items entirely, then we will provide notice to you by posting a notice on the Service or through other communications.

Note to parents.

Billing Disputes

You must notify OP Media of any disputed charges within thirty (30) days of the charge being posted to your account [through this form](https://www.ownagepranks.com/contact-us/). OP Media will attempt to resolve all disputes within 30 days of being notified of a dispute. To the extent OP Media determines, at its sole discretion, that a billing adjustment is warranted, your account will be credited accordingly. If you fail to notify OP Media of a billing dispute as noted above, you will waive all rights to bring any claim regarding the disputed charges.

INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold OP Media harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees, fees incurred in settling disputes, and fees incurred enforcing this indemnification provision) we incur in relation to, arising from, or for the purpose of avoiding, any claim or demand from a third party created by your use or, misuse of, or access to the Service including, but not limited to, (i) your violation of this Agreement; (ii) your Content; (iii) your interaction with other Users; (iv) violations of the TCPA or any other telecommunications-related laws.

OP Media retains the right to employ OP Media’s own counsel. You remain solely responsible for OP Media’s defense and must obtain OP Media’s written consent to a settlement. You agree to notify OP Media of a pending suit claiming you have violated a third party’s intellectual property or other rights. OP Media requires that you confirm your indemnification in case of a lawsuit; failure to do so may be considered a breach of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, attorney’s fees and costs shall include the fees and costs related to enforcing this indemnification.  

TERMINATION
-----------

OP Media may terminate, change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) or your access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your use of the Service and related Content.

NO WARRANTIES
-------------

You understand and agree that the Service are provided to you "AS IS" and on an "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
-----------------------

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY BETWEEN YOU AND OP MEDIA WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, IF NO AMOUNT WAS PAID FOR THE SERVICE, OUR LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED $500. WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE OR ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OP MEDIA OR OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE. CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE MADE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME (ASSUMED TO BE ONE YEAR).

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO: (I) YOUR VIOLATION OF THE TCPA OR ANY COMMUNICATION OR CONSUMER-PROTECTION RELATED LAW OR REGULATION; (II) THE PARTIES INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS

AGREEMENT; (III) NEGLIGENT, WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL ACTS OF A PARTY (IV) LOSSES SUFFERED BY A PARTY ARISING OUT OF ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THE OTHER PARTY THAT ARE COMMITTED OR OMITTED BY THE OTHER PARTY INTENTIONALLY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE OTHER PARTY KNOWS OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH ACTS OR OMISSIONS WOULD SPECIFICALLY RESULT IN DAMAGES.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. In these cases, OP Media’s liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
------------------

For any dispute you have with OP Media, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that OP Media has not been able to resolve a dispute after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding mediation. If, for some technical, legal, or jurisdictional reason, binding mediation is wholly unavailable, then any dispute shall be resolved through binding arbitration.

Unless you and OP Media decide otherwise, mediation or arbitration will be conducted in Arlington, VA or Los Angeles, CA unless objectively, unduly burdensome to one party. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative and third-party fees. The award rendered by the mediator or arbitrator shall include costs of mediation/arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the mediator or arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For avoidance of doubt, if there are one or more disputed items that remain unresolved at the end of the mediation, the mediator will render a final and binding decision on those unresolved items. The mediator's decisions shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation, costs include attorney’s fees required to enforce the mediator’s decision.  Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the courts for matters related unauthorized access to the Service.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE MEDIATOR OR ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OP MEDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
