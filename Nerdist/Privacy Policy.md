You have certain rights with respect to Personal Information under certain U.S. state privacy laws. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), these rights have been extended to Personal Information collected, used, and shared between businesses (B2B), however, these rights have not been extended in any other state. As a result, these rights are limited to consumers and not applicable to individuals in their capacity as employees of businesses that are exchanging personal information between one another. If you are in Europe, please review the section titled “Your European Privacy Rights” below. For purposes of this subsection, the terms “consumer”, “Personal Information”, “business purpose”, “third party”, “sell”, and “share” have the meanings ascribed to them respectively in the applicable state law. To the extent provided for under the applicable laws, you may have the right to:

* **Access and Disclosure.** You can request, up to two times every 12 months, that we disclose to you the categories of Personal Information we collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information, the categories of Personal Information we sold or disclosed, the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing your Personal Information, the categories of third parties with whom we shared the Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you.

You can use an opt-out preference signal by downloading a supported browser or extension.
