You have certain rights with respect to Personal Information under certain U.S. state privacy laws. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), these rights have been extended to Personal Information collected, used, and shared between businesses (B2B), however, these rights have not been extended in any other state. As a result, these rights are limited to consumers and not applicable to individuals in their capacity as employees of businesses that are exchanging personal information between one another. If you are in Europe, please review the section titled “Your European Privacy Rights” below. For purposes of this subsection, the terms “consumer”, “Personal Information”, “business purpose”, “third party”, “sell”, and “share” have the meanings ascribed to them respectively in the applicable state law. To the extent provided for under the applicable laws, you may have the right to:

* **Access and Disclosure.** You can request, up to two times every 12 months, that we disclose to you the categories of Personal Information we collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information, the categories of Personal Information we sold or disclosed, the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing your Personal Information, the categories of third parties with whom we shared the Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you. You also have the right to request a portable copy of your Personal Information.

You can use an opt-out preference signal by downloading a supported browser or extension. If known, we will also treat the opt-out preference signal as a valid request to opt-out of sale/sharing for the user.

If you would like to designate an authorized agent to submit a request to know, delete, or correct Personal Information on your behalf, please email us at datarequest@legendary.com to verify your identity and provide written proof of permission.

Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at [**https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout**](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at [**https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/**](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/), or downloading the [**Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on**](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

To learn more about targeted ads and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from third parties, please visit: (i) for [website targeted ads from DAA participants](https://www.aboutads.info/choices); (ii) for [app targeted ads from DAA participants](https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices); and (iii) for [targeted ads from NAI participants](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).

You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and turning off tracking for advertising purposes.
