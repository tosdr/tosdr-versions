However, if you do not submit certain personal data to Natus, or if you exercise your rights to prevent us from using such personal data, you should be aware that we may not be able to do business with you. This section supplements this Policy and applies solely to EEA/UK Residents. For the purposes of applicable data privacy legislation, Natus Medical Incorporated is the “controller” of EEA/UK Residents’ personal data under this Policy.

Our legal bases for collecting and using personal data:

We are entitled to use your personal data in the ways set out in this Policy on the following legal bases:

* the use of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract with you for provision of our products and/or services or to take steps at your request prior to entering into such a contract;
* we have legal obligations that we must discharge;
* the use of your personal data is necessary for our legitimate interests;
* you have consented to such use; and/or
* to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights for the purposes of legal proceedings.

We do not expect to process “sensitive” or “special” categories of personal data under the GDPR or UK GDPR, however, if we were to process such personal data, we would do so only where we have asked for your explicit consent or where such processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or is otherwise permitted under applicable laws.  

International transfers: Our processing of your personal information may involve transferring your personal information outside of the EEA or the UK, including to countries such as the United States which may not offer the same standard of protection for personal information as countries within the EEA or the UK. Whenever we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA or the UK to countries that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission and/or the relevant public authority in the UK, as applicable, we seek to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by, where required by the GDPR or the UK GDPR, using specific contracts approved by the European Commission or the relevant public authority in the UK. You may be entitled, in accordance with the GDPR or the UK GDPR, as applicable, to request further information regarding such safeguards, which you can do by contacting us using the details set forth at the end of this Policy.

Your rights in connection with personal data:

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

* Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are processing it lawfully;
* Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you corrected;
* Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also may have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes;
* Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see above);
* Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and/or
* Request the transfer of your personal data to another party in a machine-readable, commonly used and structured format.

If you want to exercise any of these rights, then please contact us using the details set forth at the end of this Policy. The various rights are not absolute and each is subject to certain exceptions or qualifications. For example, if you wish to withdraw your consent or object to processing, we may need to discuss with you whether our use of your personal data needs to continue for other lawful purposes, such as fulfilment of a legal or contractual requirement.

We will respond to your request within one month of receipt of your request. In some cases, we may not be able to fulfil your request to exercise the right before this date and may need to request more time. Where we cannot provide a full response to you for any reason, we will let you know about our inability to do so in our initial reply to your request.  

Your duty to inform us of changes: It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your working relationship with us.

Fees: You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other above-listed rights). In some cases, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive, or if you request multiple copies of the information. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

What we may need from you: To access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other above-listed rights), we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the personal data (or to exercise any of your other above-listed rights). This is another appropriate security measure designed to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Right to complain: If you wish to request further information about any of the above-listed rights, or if you are unhappy with how we have handled your personal data, please contact us using the details set forth at the end of this Policy. If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint or believe our processing of your information does not comply with the GDPR, UK GDPR or other applicable data privacy legislation, you can make a complaint to the supervisory authority in your country. For example, in the UK you should contact the Information Commissioner’s Office at: [https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/) or 0303 123 1113.

California residents have certain rights with respect to their personal information pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, collectively, the “CCPA”), as applicable and as further described in this section. If you are a California resident and do not agree with our use of your personal information as set forth in this Policy, you should not submit your personal information to Natus. This section supplements this Policy and applies solely to California residents.

You may have certain rights regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information under the CCPA, as described below. These rights are not absolute and each is subject to certain exceptions or qualifications:

* Access: You may have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months, the categories of third parties with which such information has been disclosed or sold, the sources from which such information was collected, and the business purpose for such collection, use, disclosure or sales.
* Correction and Deletion: You may have the right to request that we correct or delete certain personal information we have collected about you.
* Opt-Out of Sale or Certain Sharing: The CCPA gives California residents the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information, as well as the sharing of their personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. However, Natus does not sell personal information or share it for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.

You have the right to appoint an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. If you designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf (1) we may require you to provide the authorized agent written permission to do so and (2) for access and deletion requests, we may require you to verify your own identity directly (as described above).

If you choose to exercise rights you may have under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment from us for doing so. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. This notice may be made available in alternative formats upon request.
