We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your personal information will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

11\. Children’s Privacy
-----------------------

We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children on our Services. Some of the features on our Sites and Games are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those features.

When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:

* Notifying parents or guardians about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;
* In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from a parent or guardian for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and Services directly to their children; and
* Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.

If you are a parent or guardian and wish to review or change the information we may have about your child, email us at [privacysupport@pikpok.com](https://pikpok.com/privacy-policy/privacysupport@pikpok.com).

12\. Additional Information for Residents of California and Certain Other U.S. States
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the laws of California and certain other U.S. states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia, the residents of those U.S. states who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of our disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for their direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email [privacyofficer@pikpok.com](mailto:privacyofficer@pikpok.com).

The California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business & Professions Code §§22575-22579) requires operators of websites to disclose how they respond to “do not track” (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites or online services. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. While some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning our collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this Policy. For information about Do Not Track, please visit: [www.allaboutdnt.org](https://www.allaboutdnt.org/)

We recommend submitting data access requests using methods described in 9. Your rights to access, control, and correct your personal information.

You can also submit requests to exercise your data rights through any of the methods in Section 14 (Contact Us). Once you contact us to exercise any of your rights, we will first acknowledge receipt of your request within 10 business days of receipt of your request. Note we may ask for some confirmation details before actioning any request. Please keep in mind that limiting use of, or deleting, your personal information may impact features and uses that rely on that information.\[EC1\]

#### Verification; Authorized Agents

We may need to verify your identity in order to process your request to exercise your data rights, and we reserve the right to confirm your identity and residency, and in our discretion, deny your request if we are unable to verify your identity or residency. You may authorize someone to make a request to exercise your rights on your behalf (an authorized agent). Authorized agents will need to demonstrate to us that you have authorized them to act on your behalf, or must demonstrate they have power of attorney pursuant to applicable probate law. We retain the right to request confirmation directly from you confirming that the agent is authorized to make such a request, or to request additional information to confirm the agent’s identity and/or verify the authenticity of the request directly with you.

#### Response Timing and Format

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. \[EC2\] The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

#### Appeals; Non-Discrimination

In certain U.S. states, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to the data rights described above.

* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
