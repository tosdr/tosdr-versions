1\. Preamble
------------

Welcome to our website! We place great importance upon the protection of your data and the protection of your privacy. Following, we want to describe which data we process when, for what purpose, and on which legal basis. With this, we want to explain to you how our services work and how the protection of your personal data is guaranteed.

According to art. 4 para. 1 DSGVO, personal data includes all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly. More information can be found, among others, in art. 4 para. 1 DSGVO.

This privacy policy can be retrieved, saved and printed at any time at [https://www.metadata2go.com/privacy](https://www.metadata2go.com/privacy).

If we cite our legitimate interest or the legitimate interest of a third party (art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO) as the legal basis for the processing of personal data, you have the **right of objection** under art. 21 DSGVO:

**Under art. 21 DSGVO you have the right to**

**object to the processing of personal data at any time. We will then no longer process personal data for the purpose of direct marketing or any related profiling.**

**We also do not process your personal data for other purposes after an objection, unless we can provide compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing, which outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms or if the processing serves the assertion, exertion or defense of legal claims (cf. Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, so-called “restricted right of objection”). In this case, you must state the grounds for your objection which result from your specific situation.**

**You can also object the processing of your personal data for reasons that arise from your specific situation, after they had been processed for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with art. 89 para. 1 DSGVO, unless the processing is necessary for performing a task in the public interest (cf. Art. 21 para. 6 DSGVO).**

  

In the individual sections, we will also point out the right of objection to you separately (e.g. by using the note: “**You have the right of objection**”) if this right exists. There, you will also find further information on how to exercise your right of objection.

    6\. Information about Google services
    -------------------------------------
    
    On our website we use various services of Google LLC ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    
    More detailed information about the specific Google services we use on our website can be found following in this privacy policy.
    
    By integrating Google services, Google may collect and process information (including personal data) about you. It cannot be excluded that Google may also transfer the information to a server in a third country.
    
    As stated in Google’s Privacy Shield certification (you can find it under https://www.privacyshield.gov/list by searching for “Google”), Google committed to comply to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework for the collection, usage, and storage of personal data from EU or Swiss member states. Google, including Google LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the USA, has stated via certification to comply to the Privacy Shield principles. Further information can be found at [https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?gl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?gl=en).
    
    We ourselves cannot influence which data is collected and processed by Google. However, Google states that, among others, the following information (including personal data) might be processed:
    
    * Protocol data (especially the IP address)

    * When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.“ ([https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en))
    
      
    
    A direct addition of this data can be prevented by logging out of your Google account or by adjusting the appropriate account settings in your Google account. Furthermore, you can prevent the installation of cookies – if Google sets them – by using the appropriate settings in your browser; however we would like to point out that, in this case, you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent.

    7\. Usage of Google Analytics
    -----------------------------
    
    On our website we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. („Google“), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    
    Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Google Analytics may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on a website can be evaluated. The information about the usage of our website (including the IP address of the users) generated by cookies and web beacons are transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries. This information might be shared by Google with Google’s contract partners.
    
    **Information** on Google’s existing Privacy Shield certification and other relevant data relating to Google’s processing of data in the scope of using Google services can be found in this data processing declaration in paragraph “**6) Information about Google services”**.
    
    The following types of data is processed by Google:
    
    * Online identifiers (including cookie identifiers)
    * IP address
    * Device identifiers
    
    In addition, you can find more detailed information about the processed information at [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#infocollect](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en#infocollect) under “Information Google collects”, as well as at [https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/).
    
    We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled (“anonymize IP”). This results in the shortening of your IP address by Google within member states of the European Union or other states that are part of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is transmitted to one of Google’s servers in the USA and shortened there.
    
    Furthermore, we concluded a contract of order processing with Google for the use of Google Analytics (art. 28 DSGVO). Google processes the data on our behalf in order to evaluate your usage of the website, to compile reports about the website activity for us, and to provide us with further services relating to website and internet usage. Google might transfer this information to third parties when required by law or if third parties process this data on Google’s behalf.
    
    By integrating Google Analytics, we pursue the purpose of analyzing the user behavior on our website and being able to react to it. This enables us to continuously improve our offer.
    
    The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here is art. 6 para. 1 lit f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest for this is the great benefit for our offer that is provided by the functions described above. The statistical evaluation of the user behavior enables us to react and optimize our offers according to the interests of our customers in particular.
    
    Within the scope of order processing, Google is entitled to commission subcontractors. You can find a list of these subcontractors under [https://privacy.google.com/businesses/subprocessors/](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/subprocessors/).
    
    Right of objection
    ------------------
    
    **You have the right to object.** To do so, you can prevent the processing of your data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)
    
    You can also prevent the acquisition by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie is set, which prevents the future acquisition of your data when visiting this website: [Deactivate Google Analytics](javascript:gaOptout())
    
    Furthermore, you can change your cookie preferences (e.g. deleting cookies, blocking cookies, etc.). More information about this can be found under “**5) Cookies**”.
    
      
    
    The processed information is stored for 26 months and will be deleted automatically at the end of this period.
    
    The provision of personal data is neither required by law nor by contract, and it is not necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide personal data. However, the lack of provision may result in you not being able to use our website entirely or to its full extent.
    
    8\. Usage of DoubleClick by Google (Google Ad Manager)
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    This website uses Google Ad Manager, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. („Google“), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    
    DoubleClick For Publishers uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited.

    **Information** on Google’s existing Privacy Shield certification and other relevant data relating to Google’s processing of data in the scope of using Google services can be found in this privacy policy under paragraph “**6) Information about Google services**”.
    
    The cookies might also contain so-called cookie IDs. They are individual character sequences that serve the attribution of the cookies. They can be used to, e.g., record so-called “conversions”. These allow to determine to what extend subsequent browser activities show relations to ads, for example, if a purchase was made from same browser on which a corresponding ad was placed.
    
    The cookies set by DoubleClick For Publishers serve the purpose of analyzing the user behavior for marketing purposes, for example, to place relevant ads and to evaluate the success of the ad campaigns.
    
    The data processed by us in the scope of DoubleClick For Publishers are also processed by Google as an additional responsible party. The details are regulated at [https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/controllerterms/) and can be viewed there by you.
    
    By integrating DoubleClick For Publishers, we pursue the purpose to reach our users in the best possible way with our advertisements, to portray user behavior, and to enable us to react to user behavior, as well as to analyze user behavior for marketing purposes, to, for example, place relevant ads for you and to evaluate the success of advertising campaigns.
    
    The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here is art. 6 para. 1. lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest for this is the great benefit for our offer that is provided by the functions described above. Through optimized advertising campaigns, we reduce our divergence loss and improve the reach of our advertising media. Further, Google has a legitimate interest in the processed (personal) data in order to improve their own services.
    
    Right of objection
    ------------------
    
    **You have the right to object.**
    
    You have the possibility to disable the setting of DoubleClick cookies. All you need to do is click on this opt-out link to place a DoubleClick deactivation cookie in your browser.
    
    Furthermore, you can change your settings for personalized advertising at [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/) and set the corresponding opt-out cookies.
    
    Also, you can change your cookie preferences (e.g. deleting cookies, blocking cookies, etc.). More information about this can be found under “**5) Cookies**”.
    
      
    
    The processed information are stored for as long as they are necessary for the intended purpose or for as long as it is legally required.
    
    The provision of personal data is neither required by law nor by contract, and it is not necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide personal data. However, the lack of provision may result in you not being able to use our website entirely or to its full extent.
    
    9\. Usage of Google AdSense
    ---------------------------
    
    On our website, we also use the functions of the online advertising service Google AdSense. Google AdSense is a service of Google Inc. ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    
    Google AdSense is a Google service that displays Google advertisements from advertisers on third-party websites. By integrating Google AdSense we provide Google with appropriate advertising space o our website.
    
    Google AdSense uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Google AdSense may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on the pages of this offer can be evaluated. The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the usage of our website (including your IP address) and the delivery of advertising formats will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries. This way, Google can reconstruct on which websites the usage of advertising media took place in order to be able to allocate a commission to the website operator.
    
    **Information** on Google’s existing Privacy Shield certification and other relevant data relating to Google’s processing of data in the scope of using Google services can be found in this privacy policy under paragraph “**6) Information about Google services**”.
    
    Through the integration of Google AdSense, we pursue the purpose of being able to offer you interest-based advertisements, and to be able to finance our offer through the successful use of advertising media. For this, we are using the option “contextual-only advertisements” from Google AdSense. This means that Google will broadcast advertisements based on the content of our website and not on the interest profile created by you. Therefore, an analysis of your data for the purpose of profiling does not take place here. However, Google also uses cookies and web beacons in the scope of the “contextual-only advertisements” to prevent abuse, compile statistics, and prevent multiple visits.
    
    The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here is art. 6 para. 1. lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest for this is the great benefit for our offer that is provided by the functions described above. We have a legitimate interest in presenting you with contextual advertisement on our website in order to achieve the highest possible success rate of the advertising media.
    
    The data will only be stored as long as it is necessary for the provision of this function. You can find the Google Advertisment Privacy Policy here: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
    
    Right of objection
    ------------------
    
    **You have the right to object.** To do so, you can decide to disable all the Google Advertisement Cookies by clicking on: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/optout](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/optout)
    
    In addition, you have the possibility to deactivate the interest-based ads from Google according to the instructions in the following link: [https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en)
    
    Furthermore, you can change your cookie preferences (e.g. deleting cookies, blocking cookies, etc.). More information about this can be found under “5. Cookies”.
    
      
    
    The provision of personal data is neither required by law nor by contract, and it is not necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide personal data. However, the lack of provision may result in you not being able to use our website entirely or to its full extent.
    
    10\. Usage of Google reCAPTCHA
    ------------------------------
    
    This website uses Google reCAPTCHA (hereinafter reCAPTCHA), a captcha service of Google Inc. („Google“), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    
    Google reCAPTCHA serves to ensure that entries made on our website are actually made by real persons and not automated, e.g., via software (so-called robots).
    
    For this purpose, reCAPTCHA (No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA) displays a clickable checkbox “I’m not a robot” to you. To do so, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of a user as soon as they visit the website based on different characteristics. If necessary, you will also be shown various images after clicking on the checkbox, which you have to assign to a given image subject by clicking on the relevant images.
    
    The integration of reCAPTCHA takes place via an interface (“API”) to the Google services. By integrating reCAPTCHA, Google may collect and process information (including personal data). It can not be ruled out that Google also transfers the information to a server in a third country.
    
    reCAPTCHA uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Furthermore, reCAPTCHA also uses so-called web beacons, small pixels or graphics. The information generated by cookies, possibly in conjunction with the web beacons, about the usage of our website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries.
    
    **Information** on Google’s existing Privacy Shield certification and other relevant data relating to Google’s processing of data in the scope of using Google services can be found in this privacy policy under paragraph “**6) Information about Google services**”.
    
    More information about how reCAPTCHA works can be found at: [https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/)
    
    Via the integration of reCAPTCHA, we pursue the purpose of determining whether inputs on our website are made by a real person or a bot.
    
    The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here is art. 6 para. 1. lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest for this is the great benefit for our offer that is provided by the functions described above. The automated check of whether a real person or a bot is making an entry accelerates and facilitates our workload and improves the level of reliability of the entries made. Furthermore, it prevents misuse. In addition, Google has a legitimate interest in the collected (personal) data in order to improve its own services.
    
    Right of objection
    ------------------
    
    **You have the right to object.**
    
    Furthermore, you can change your cookie preferences (e.g. deleting cookies, blocking cookies, etc.). More information about this can be found under “**5) Cookies**”.
    
      
    
    The processed information will only be stored as long as it is necessary for the purpose it was processed for.
    
    The provision of personal data is neither required by law nor by contract, and it is not necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide personal data. However, the lack of provision may result in you not being able to use our website entirely or to its full extent.
    
    11\. Web analysis tool Matomo
    -----------------------------
    
    On our website, we use the open-source software Matomo (formerly PIWIK). Matomo is offered by Matomo.org. It is provided primarily by InnoCraft Ltd., 150 Willis St, 6011 Wellington, New Zealand.
    
    Matomo is a web analysis tool which serves the analysis and evaluation of our website and its users. In particular, we utilize Matomo to log and analyze the surfing behavior of the users of our website.
