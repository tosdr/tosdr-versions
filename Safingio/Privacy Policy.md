Article 1. Where we collect Data/PII from
-----------------------------------------

At present, Safing ICS Technologies GmbH runs four (4) services, these are as follows, Website, Forum, SPN, and Portmaster update server: these services collect different levels of data, however we aim to collect as little as possible, and all data received by us is treated with the strictest of confidence with privacy always in mind, all data is held securely.

Article 2. Personal Identifiable Information & Data we collect
--------------------------------------------------------------

Although the information collected is basic and may not be classed as PII, we treat all data with the same respect and as such have listed all the data we collect from the services we provide.

### Websites and other Web Services

Safing operates these websites, hosted and managed by GitHub ([Pages](https://pages.github.com/)):

* Website: https://safing.io
* Documentation: https://wiki.safing.io

You can [read GitHub’s privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) to see how they handle your data.

  

Safing additionally operates and manages the following websites:

* Account Service: https://account.safing.io
* Account API Service: https://api.account.safing.io
* Asset Server: https://assets.safing.io
* Update Server: https://updates.safing.io
* Support Server: https://support.safing.io
* Self-Hosted [Plausible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics) Server: https://plausible.safing.io

The following personal identifiable information (PII) is held for technical reasons and is deleted after 72 hours:

* IP Address
* User Agent

This is how the 72 hours are broken up:

* Up to 24 hours until the raw logs are processed.
* Another 24 hours for processing in technical and operational systems.
* Another 24 hours for guaranteed full deletion.

While 72 hours is the maximum holding time period we guarantee, the time to deletion is usually a lot shorter.

  

Independently from this process, we always reduce PII as early as possible to reduce the time it is held and also reduce the number of systems the information is exposed to in the first place. In some cases we even manage to delete IP addresses within an hour.

### Your Account

If you register for and use an account on https://account.safing.io, we additionally collect this information:

* User name, supplied by you, not your real name.
* Email address, required for some payment methods, our contact with you for account related information.
* Country, and country calling code, required for Austrian taxation law.
* Transaction identifiers necessary for processing, supplied to us by third party payment providers.
* Password, always stored in an encrypted (hashed) form.

This service also includes the domain https://api.account.safing.io, which hosts the API that the Portmaster interacts with.

### The Portmaster Software

The Portmaster software runs locally on your device and monitors your network traffic in order to block unwanted connections. While it handles a lot of PII internally, at no point does the Portmaster software share any PII with us or anyone else, with the exception of the following cases:

The Portmaster interacts with the following **Web Services by Safing**: https://updates.safing.io, https://support.safing.io, https://account.safing.io, https://api.account.safing.io  
Please refer to the previous sections to learn about these services.

If you choose to report an issue or give feedback via the **support system** within the Portmaster software, it sends your request with all its attached data to https://support.safing.io, which then forwards it to your chosen support channel.

If you use the **Safing Privacy Network (SPN)** module of the Portmaster, it supplies the username and password you enter to https://api.account.safing.io in order to log in. These credentials are not provided to any server in the SPN, but an authorization token is used instead. In the network itself, only the initial server knows and handles your IP address, which is never logged.

Please note that not all servers in the SPN are operated by Safing. If the Portmaster makes use of **servers that are operated by the community** (ie. a third party), we cannot guarantee how your information is handled by these operators. While we need to make you aware of this policy-wise, there is no privacy risk associated with this, as the SPN is built to protect your privacy in exactly this case and every server only receives minimal and only parts of the connection data, so that no server can both identify you and identify what you do online.

As the Portmaster is also a **DNS Client**, it sends DNS queries to the configured DNS Providers.  
When you start using or configuring the Portmaster, please read the privacy policy of the configured DNS Providers.

### Customer Support

Safing ICS Technologies GmbH run customer support services for its users, customer support covers all aspects of the services provided, including and not limited to: accounts, Portmaster, SPN, general enquiries and questions about our policies etc. The information received, gathered, collected and held whilst running this service is as follows:

* **Emails**, received by Safing ICS Technologies GmbH, to aid enquiries and for future reference.
* **Email address**, required for customer service replies etc. our contact with you for account related information.
* **Email content**, held for the purposes of site and service enhancement.

### Forum

At present the forum is run on a third party service, however, with respect to being open and transparent, our forum when running, is usually on the Reddit platform, we have no control on how their service collects, stores, shares, handles, or uses data, and as such, you are advised to read any and all privacy policies of the sites you intend to use.

### Surveys

Safing ICS Technologies GmbH run surveys both continuous and in limited time scope in order to best know and understand the needs of our customers, these are used for development and enhancement of our services, data supplied by users is kept until a user deletes it, these surveys only collect basic information and not PII, by way of example and not limited to, "Which Operating Systems do you use?".

Article 8. California Online Privacy Protection Act, (CalOPPA) explained
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States of America to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

The law’s reach stretches well beyond California and requires a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites/online services collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website, that states exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared. If you would like to read more about this policy, please visit:

• We will notify the users via in site notification within 1 business day.

We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
