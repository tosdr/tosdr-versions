This Privacy Statement also does not apply to information collected by third parties, like third-party websites, social media platforms or accounts, third-party service providers, or other third-party services or applications that integrate with our Services. This Privacy Statement also does not apply to any information that is not personally identifiable, like aggregated or anonymous information.

Personal Information We Collect
-------------------------------

  

We collect or receive information in the ways we describe in this section.

  

Categories of Information We Collect

* Information You Provide Us
* When You Create an Account
* Content or Information You Provide in the Services
* Content You Provide Through Our Site
* Support Channels or Communities
* Marketing Information
* Partner Program
* Payment Processing Information
* Technical, Device, and Connection Information
* Cookies and Other Tracking Technology
* Other Information Sources

  

**Information You Provide Us**: When you sign up to create an account in the Service, download content from the Site, fill out a form or survey or respond to communications, you provide us with information like your name, email address, address, company, phone number or other information. When you register for a community or a partner program, we collect account registration information like your name, email address, address, company, phone number, or other information. You may provide comments, communications, feedback, ratings, or other information when you use the Services or any of our communities or partner programs.

  

**When You Create an Account**: When you create an account, you provide us with your account registration and profile information (name, email address, company, and similar information). We automatically track certain information about your use of the Services, partner programs, or communities. We collect information about you when you login and how you interact with the Services, the features you use, clicks, log information about your use of the Services, and how you interact with other users. We describe the information we collect through the Services in more detail in [Zapier Services](https://zapier.com/privacy/zapier-services) statement.

  

**Content or Information You Provide in the Services**: The Services allow you to create connections or integrations between the third-party applications you use. When you use the Services, information or content is transferred from one application to another application. We collect the information that is transferred between the third-party applications. We describe the information we collect through your use of the Services in more detail in the [Zapier Services](https://zapier.com/privacy/zapier-services) statement. Other users may provide information about individuals when they submit content or information through the Services. For example, if a user sets up a Zap that allows automated calendaring, that user will share information about the individuals they schedule meetings with via the Zap. Users may also provide information about their teammates, including name and email address, to invite teammates to use the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information if they designate you as a user, the billing contact, technical contact, or administrator. You or your administrator may integrate the Services with third-party applications. In such case, we will receive information that allows us to identify your account within the third-party applications (like name, email address, phone number, tokens, or other identifying information), the log data, content, and device information. The information or content we receive from your organization is subject to your organization’s privacy policies. When you integrate our Services with a third-party application, the information we receive depends on the settings, permissions, and privacy Statement controlled by that third-party application.

  

**Content You Provide Through Our Site**: If the Site or our social media platform pages allow you to upload content or information, we will collect the content or information you upload. For example, when you provide feedback, participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, activities, or events, you may provide us information or content.

  

**Information You Provide Through Support Channels or Communities**: You may provide information or content to us through the customer support or chat functionality we make available on the Site, in the Services, or other sites that we control. When you engage with our support team, in addition to your account information, we may ask you to provide additional information about your issue, which may include information about your technology, software, internet connection, or screenshots. To submit information to a community site, we may require you to create an account within the community (we will collect your account registration information like name, email, company, address, and phone number). If you have an account in the Services, we will associate your community membership and activities with your Services account. As a community member, you and other members may submit questions, provide answers, engage with members through chat or comments, create content or webinars to share with the community, or solicit feedback or help from other community members.

  

**Marketing Information**: We receive information about you directly from you when you engage with the Site and automatically when you engage with the Site or open or click the emails we send you (See Information You Provide Us and Cookies and Other Tracking Technology). We receive information from third-party sources like lead generation providers, content sponsors, event sponsors, or social media platforms. The information we collect from third-party sources may include marketing or demographic information, contact information (name, email, company, address, job title), information about your profile on those platforms, or information about purchasing intent. We may combine this information with the information we collect.

  

**Partner Programs**: We have several partner programs that we make available: our developer platform program (which allows third-party application providers to build integrations to Zapier) and our expert program (which connects experts who help our customers set up and use the Services). Partners may also help us to market and promote our Services, generate leads, or they may resell our Services. We may add partner programs in the future. Through partner programs, we collect account registration information (like name, email address, company, and phone number), information about an individual’s technical skill set, comments, questions or feedback, rating or ranking information, images, content, or other information you provide. We may also receive information from our partners (like business contact information, address, job title, email address, or phone number). We will combine the information you provide and the information we receive with your account information.

  

**Payment Processing Information**: When you create a paid account within the Services or otherwise initiate a transaction with us, we will use a third-party payment processor to process the payment. We do not collect your credit card number, expiration date, or pin number. The transaction details we retain are those details that allow us to verify that you paid for the Services or transaction, including price, currency, date of payment, payment method, name, and account name. We will combine that information with your account information.

  

**Technical, Device, and Connection Information**: When you use the Services or interact with our Site, we automatically collect information about the device you use to access the Site or Services. When you interact with our branded social media sites, the social media platform automatically collects information and provides it to us. This information includes information that identifies you and connection type, settings, operating system, browser type, internet protocol (IP) address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data.

  

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technology**: We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or other tracking technology on the Site and in the Services to provide functionality, personalize your experience and recognize you across services or devices. This information includes IP addresses, location, device type, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, click data, device-identifying data. We may combine this automatically collected information with other information that you provide us through other channels. You can learn more about our cookies in the Cookie Notice statement. When you interact with our social media sites, the social media platform automatically collects information and provides it to us.

  

**Other Information Sources**: We receive information about you from other sources like third-party service providers, public databases, and our business and channel partners. This information may include business contact information, address, job title, email address, phone number. We may combine this information with information we collect through other means.
