Last updated: November 15, 2024

This notice explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them. Please read this Notice carefully so that you can be informed about our cookie handling practices when accessing or using our Services.

**3\. What are cookies?**
-------------------------

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites function, to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 

We use both first-party and third-party cookies on our Services. First-party cookies are cookies that are placed on your device by us, while third-party Cookies set by parties other than Matterport. Third-Party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Website (for example advertising, interactive content, interaction with social media sites, and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer or mobile device both when you visit our Website, and also when you visit certain other websites. 

Generally, information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies does not constitute personal information as defined by GDPR. However, if exceptionally such collected information does constitute personal information (such as IP addresses or similar identifiers), we will treat it as personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

**4\. How long will cookies stay on my browsing device?**
---------------------------------------------------------

Our retention periods for cookie information depend on whether the cookie is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Each category of cookie listed below is either a session cookie or persistent cookie.

We use “persistent cookies” to save information about you for longer periods of time, while “session” cookies are deleted when you close your browser or after a short period of time. Persistent cookies are stored for varied lengths of time depending on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You can delete cookie data as described 

**5\. Why does Matterport use cookies?**
----------------------------------------

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Matterport uses cookies to help it understand how the Services are being used, such as whether you spent more time on a certain part of the Services, whether you experienced any technical issues, and more.  Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website and Services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience of our Service. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.

**6\. What types of cookies does Matterport use?**
--------------------------------------------------

We use the cookies described below on our Services:

* **Strictly Necessary Cookies.** These cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.  They are usually set only in response to actions made by you which amount to requests to provide the Service to you through our Websites. Strictly necessary cookies allow you to use our Services and to enable access to various features such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms, creating a unique user session, and enabling access to secure areas.  You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. Matterport serves these cookies directly.
    
* **Performance Cookies.** These cookies are used to enhance and improved the performance of our Websites and our Services but are not essential. These cookies collect information that helps us understand how the Websites and Services are being used by our customers and how effective our marketing campaigns are. These cookies may collect IP addresses and may generate a unique identifiers to analyze how frequently you visit our Websites, and gather other metrics such as page views. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
    
* **Functionality Cookies.** These cookies enable our Service and Websites to provide enhanced functionality and personalized features. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. Although these cookies are not strictly necessary, if you disable them, certain functionality may not be available to you. 
    
* **Targeting Cookies.** Targeting cookies are used by our advertising and marketing partners and work primarily through uniquely identifying your device (e.g., advertising ID, IP address, geolocation), and are used to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other websites you may visit. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
    
* **Use of Local Storage.** Cookies are not the only way to store information on your computer or mobile device. Matterport stores additional information that is essential to the functionality of the Services in local storage. Local storage is similar to the storage of information in cookies, but never expires until our Services delete this information, or you delete it yourself. Please refer to the instructions specific to the type of browser you are using, or the specific mobile phone operating system you are using for instructions on how to delete local storage.
    
* **Other Tracking Technologies.** Cookies are not the only way to track visitors to a website. Matterport and our third party partners may use other similar technologies such as clear GIFs (also known as “tracking pixels” and “web beacons”). Clear GIFs are small graphics files that contain an identifier that recognizes when a user visits our Websites. This allows our third-party partners to monitor traffic patterns between websites, communicate with cookies, to understand if you have come from an advertisement displayed on a third party Website, to monitor the success of marketing campaigns and to improve site performance. These technologies typically rely on cookies to function, so disabling cookies in your browser will impair their functionality.
    

**7\. How can you manage cookies via our website and your browser settings?**

**Managing Cookies via Your Browser.** In addition to our Cookie Settings, you can also manage cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to control cookies as part of their settings and preferences, such as enabling, disabling, or deleting cookies.

**8\. How can I opt-out of interest-based advertising cookies?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

We do not control interest-based advertising cookies on our Services. However, many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members.

To opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each organization’s respective participating companies, visit the DAA’s opt-out portal available at [http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/), the DAA of Canada’s opt-out portal available at [https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools](https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools), or visit the NAI’s opt-out portal available at[http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).

Residents of the European Union may opt-out of online behavioural advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s participating member organizations by visiting [https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). 

**9\. How can I opt-out of analytics and marketing cookies?**
-------------------------------------------------------------

As described in this Notice, we use third-party analytics providers to collect information about the effectiveness of our Services and marketing campaigns. Some third-party analytics and marketing cookie service providers allow you to opt-out with them directly.
