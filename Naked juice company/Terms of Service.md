Terms of Use
============

### WELCOME TO THIS NAKED JUICE JUICE OPERATED WEBSITE!

* Naked Juice Company of Glendora, Inc. (**“NAKED JUICE"** or **“we”**) maintains this site (**“Site”**).
* We've designed our Site to be useful, informative, and educational for you. Feel free to browse the Site.
* This Site is intended for and applicable only for residents of the United States, ages 18 or older. If you are from another jurisdiction or under 18 years of age, you may not use this Site.
* By accessing this Site in any way, including, without limitation, browsing this Site, using any information, and/or submitting information to NAKED JUICE, you agree to and are bound by the terms, conditions, policies and notices contained under these terms of use (the **"Terms"**), including, but not limited to, conducting this transaction electronically, disclaimers of warranties, damage and remedy exclusions and limitations, and a choice of Illinois law.
* **THANK YOU FOR VISITING!**

### THESE TERMS OF USE ARE A CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND US

These Terms are a binding contract between you and NAKED JUICE, and is accepted by you upon your use of the Site. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and NAKED JUICE regarding the use of the Site and your account. By using the Site you represent that you are capable of entering into a binding agreement, and that you agree to be bound by these Terms. NAKED JUICE may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting. Your access or use of the Site after such changes constitute your agreement to such revisions. You should therefore periodically visit this page to review the Terms to which you are bound.

### BINDING ARBITRATION

You and NAKED JUICE agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site or these Terms and/or the [Privacy Policy](https://policy.nakedjuice.com/privacy) shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in the location of your residence or otherwise in Illinois, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS, subject to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), unless any such rules are inapplicable to the dispute by their terms or otherwise inconsistent with these Terms. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may assert your claims in small claims court at the location of your residence or otherwise Illinois in accordance with these Terms if your claims satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of such small claims court, and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the enforceability, interpretation and effect of terms set forth in this provision. Otherwise, the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law or applicable federal law consistent with applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. Payment of the parties’ costs and fees owed to JAMS and the arbitrator will be determined by the JAMS Rules and Procedures and fee schedule, and in such case will be subject to any limitations on the costs and fees owed by you as provided in the JAMS Rules and Procedures. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor NAKED JUICE shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT BE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, you and NAKED JUICE agree that any individual arbitration commenced by you or by NAKED JUICE may be consolidated with any other individual arbitration(s) pending before JAMS in accordance with JAMS Comprehensive Rule 6(e), provided that either party makes such request.

BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION. DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.
