### 2.1 User generated Games and other Material

With this agreement you grant The Service the rights, without special compensation, to publish the Games and Material for an unlimited time throughout the world on the internet, on TV or any other medium.

4\. Terms of sale
-----------------

When you purchase Gold, you get the ability to purchase premium content, features, virtual items etc. in the game. Any purchases made on web are made from our partner company Paymentwall (255 9th St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA) and on mobile devices from Google and will be presented as such on credit card statements etc. Gold is provided as soon as the payment is completed and The Service has been notified by our partner. All product prices listed on The Service are subject to change without notice.

### 4.1 Mobile and landline payment security

The Service uses a third party payment provider and therefore we do not store any phone numbers or any other sensitive information in regards to mobile and landlines payment. The payment provider fully lives up to international security standards. All sensitive information is stored by the payment provider solely in encrypted form in a high security data-centre. All collection and storage of sensitive information by the payment providers conforms to the requirements of the Data Protection Act and fully obliges to all international standards.

### 4.2 Credit card payment security

The Service uses a third party payment provider and therefore we do not store any credit card or bank account information. The payment provider fully lives up to international industry security standards. All credit card and bank account information is stored by the payment provider solely in encrypted form in a high security data-centre. All collection and storage of sensitive information by the payment provider conforms to the requirements of the Data Protection Act and fully obliges to all international security standards.

### 4.3 Refunds

If you purchase services (including buying Gold or virtual goods) you lose any refund rights you may normally be entitled to when the services are made available to you. We may make exceptions at our sole discretion. If you wish to dispute a purchase you can contact The Service using the contact information mentioned at the bottom of this page.

### 4.4 Other issues

If you are under 18 years of age or do not pay your own bills, you must get permission from your parents, the person who pays your bills, the card holder or the person paying the phone bill in case of mobile and landlines payment, before making any purchases with that card or phone. If you make any unauthorised payment on The Service - regardless of payment method - your account will be permanently deleted and your IP may get blocked. Also, if you do not adhere to the The Service's Terms & Conditions, your account may be terminated and you will lose any Gold and virtual goods your profile may have. Furthermore, if you delete your own KoGaMa account, you will also lose any Gold you may have left in it.

5\. Subscriptions
-----------------

The Service offers a premium membership ('Elite membership') in the form of a paid, auto-renewable subscription. Upgrading your account with an Elite membership grants access to a range of benefits as listed on [/subscription/subscribe/](https://www.kogama.com/subscription/subscribe/) (requires login to view).

### 5.1 Plans

The Elite membership is made available according to the following payment plans:

* Monthly (Billed every month).
* Quarterly (Billed ever 3 months).
* Annual (Billed yearly).

All plans offer the same daily benefits.

### 5.2 Payment

By purchasing an auto-renewable Elite membership, you acknowledge and agree that your membership will automatically renew and, unless you cancel your membership at least 24 hours prior to expiration you authorize KoGaMa to charge the payment method associated with your account. Payments are made at confirmation of purchase.

The payment method may be either your iTunes Account, your Google Play account or the payment method associated with your last purchase through our partner service Paymentwall.

The period of the membership renewal and the cost of the membership renewal will be the same as your current membership period unless otherwise disclosed to you when you sign up for the membership.

### 5.3 Cancellation

You may cancel your subscription at any time from the _Manage Subscription_ page located in the menu that is accessed at the top right on our website. Depending on your method of payment, the 'Cancel' option on this page may take you to _iTunes_/_App Store_ (iOS) or _Google Play_ (Android).

If your subscription was made on iOS, auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your device's Account Settings after purchase.

If you cancel your membership, you receive the remainder of your period of membership that you’ve already paid for.

### 5.4 Free Trial

All new users are offered a free trial of an Elite membership for 7 days. Any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.

If any part of these Terms and Conditions is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
