About Minecraft-mp.com
----------------------

"**Minecraft-mp.com**" is a third party Minecraft server list and not an official Minecraft service. It is not approved by or associated with Mojang or Microsoft.

Minecraft and associated Minecraft images are copyright of Mojang and Microsoft.

Server Content and Information
------------------------------

You own the content and information you post on "**Minecraft-mp.com**". By adding your server to "**Minecraft-mp.com**", you consent that content covered by intellectual property rights, like server banners ("IP Content"), you specifically grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content you provide on your server's listing ("IP License"). This IP License is terminated when you delete the IP content from your server or when you deleted your account. When you remove this IP content, you understand that this deleted content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but this content will not be available to others. You also understand that such content may be accessed and used outside of "**Minecraft-mp.com**" (like search engines).

  

#### Removal of Server

We reserve the right to remove any server at anytime with or without any reason. You may delete your server off from "**Minecraft-mp.com**" at anytime by clicking on the "Delete" icon on your server management page.

  

#### Fake Player Count

Displaying a fake player count on your server is not allowed.

  

#### Duplicate Servers

Duplicate servers are not allowed. A duplicate server is a server having the same Hostname/MOTD, player count and pointing to the same IP address than another server.

  

#### SubServers

Subservers are allowed, but **only the main server can have votes**. Subservers are several servers with different Hostname/MOTD and player count but linked into a network with BungeeCord or something else.  
This is to avoid that big networks take several slots with an unfair advantage.

Vote Cheating
-------------

Vote cheating is not allowed. Any server doing vote cheating might get blocked, removed and/or blacklisted from our website.  
  
Vote cheating is:  

* A person using a VPN, Proxy or any means to make multiple daily votes.
* Using bot, script or any means to make multiple daily votes.

Termination
-----------

We reserve the right to terminate any account at anytime with or without any reason.

Warranty Disclaimer
-------------------

There are no warranties of any kind, express or implied, with respect to any service.

Change of Terms

We reserve the right to change the Terms of Service at anytime with or without notice.
