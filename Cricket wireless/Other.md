**Information About the Network Practices, Data Speeds, Performance Characteristics & Commercial Terms of Cricket's Mass Market Mobile Broadband Internet Access Service**  
  
At Cricket Wireless, we want our customers to have the information they need to fully understand and enjoy the services we offer. To help keep consumers informed about our mass market mobile broadband Internet access service, the Cricket website ([www.cricketwireless.com](https://www.cricketwireless.com/)) describes the wireless services we offer, and we make copies of our Terms and Conditions of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, and other policies available online.

* For information about our Terms and Conditions of Service, please visit [www.cricketwireless.com/terms](https://www.cricketwireless.com/terms).
* For information about our Acceptable Use Policy, please visit [www.cricketwireless.com/aup](https://www.cricketwireless.com/aup).
* For information about other policies, please visit [www.cricketwireless.com/support](https://www.cricketwireless.com/support) or [www.cricketwireless.com/legal-info/legal-information](https://www.cricketwireless.com/legal-info/legal-information).

This page provides information about the network practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms applicable to our mass market mobile broadband Internet access services and Wi-Fi broadband internet access services, consistent with the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet rules. This information should help customers make informed choices about how to use those services and will assist providers of internet applications, content and services in developing, marketing and maintaining their Internet offerings. We encourage customers and other users of our network to familiarize themselves with this information, and to provide Cricket with feedback about our mass market mobile broadband internet access services so that we can continue to provide an excellent experience.

Nothing in this document changes your rights and obligations, or ours, under our Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") or Privacy Policy. This document and the information contained in it are provided for informational purposes only and may be changed at any time, without notice.

**Network Practices**

**How does Cricket manage congestion with respect to its mass market mobile broadband internet access services?**

Cricket strives to provide a high-quality internet experience for all of our customers. Because the internet consists of multiple interconnected networks and most internet end points (e.g., websites and other content providers) are not directly connected to the Cricket network, Cricket must connect to and exchange traffic with other networks to provide its subscribers the capability of uploading data to or downloading data from internet end points that are connected to those networks. To that end, Cricket has entered into commercially negotiated agreements to exchange traffic with those networks (and the networks with which those networks are connected) on mutually agreeable terms. The links Cricket and other networks use to exchange such traffic may become congested at times. Consistent with its agreements with those other networks and its long-standing practice, Cricket may establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks, but only on mutually agreeable terms. If Cricket is unable to reach agreement on terms of interconnection or network expansion with these other networks, it could affect customers' ability to upload or download data to internet endpoints connected to those networks. Cricket does not guarantee that it will establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks, or that subscribers will be able to upload data to or download data from internet end points connected to other networks at any particular speed.

In addition, like the other networks that make up the internet, the Cricket network is a shared network, which means that the transmission links and other network resources used to provide broadband services are shared among Cricket's subscribers. Temporary congestion may occur when a large number of customers in a concentrated area access the network at the same time or when some customers consume a very large amount of network capacity during busy periods, such as at stadium events, during peak usage times, or during planned network maintenance.

As is common in the industry, we use network management practices and other tools to manage network resources for the benefit of all of our broadband customers, especially during periods when network demand exceeds available network resources (also known as "contention-congestion" or "congestion"). As you would expect, our network management practices and our service offerings have evolved over time to benefit our customers and take advantage of the resources we have spent to expand and augment our networks.

Congestion-based Data Management. One network management practice we use to manage our wireless network resources may affect customers with unlimited mobile data plans ("Cricket Unlimited Data Plans"). During periods of congestion, these customers may experience reduced data speeds and increased latency as compared to other customers using the same cell site ("Congestion-based Data Management"). Depending on the customer's Cricket Unlimited Data Plan, they may either always experience Congestion-based Data Management or experience it only after they have used a set amount of data in a billing period as outlined in their Cricket Unlimited Data Plan (for example, 22GB of data in a billing period). As always, even when subject to this congestion management practice, these customers on unlimited plans have the comfort of knowing that, no matter how much data they use in a billing cycle, they will never be subject to overage charges and will pay a single monthly flat rate. That is our essential promise with the Cricket Unlimited Data Plans. Reduced speeds and increased latency may cause web sites to load more slowly or affect the performance of data-heavy activities such as interactive gaming. Customers subject to Congestion-based Data Management may experience relative reduced speeds and increased latency when they use data at a cell site experiencing congestion for network resources at the same moment. As soon as the congestion at the cell site abates, or if the customer's session migrates to an uncongested cell site, speeds and latency are not affected by that congestion. In addition, this network management practice causes impact based only on the amount of congestion, which can start and stop over a very short time period (often measured in fractions of a second), further minimizing any customer impact. Because the amount of congestion at a cell site can vary significantly, the performance impact for affected Cricket Unlimited Data Plan customers may also vary, but such impact will last only as long as the site is congested.

For customers on mass market broadband internet access plans subject to a data usage threshold for triggering the foregoing congestion management practice, we will notify them during each billing cycle when their usage reaches 75% of their threshold (so, for example, 16.5GB for plans with a 22GB threshold) so they can adjust their usage to avoid network management practices that may result in slower data speeds.

Buffer Tuning. With the ever-increasing growth in smartphone and tablet usage on our wireless networks, and the growing prevalence of video downloads, Cricket has deployed a reasonable network management video optimization technique in our mobile data network. That technique delivers recorded video to the user's device in a "just in time" fashion ("Buffer Tuning"). Buffer Tuning only applies to internet browser traffic (HTTP, port 80) for recorded video downloads, regardless of the source (including Cricket branded or 3rd party content) and does not affect real-time streaming video. Without Buffer Tuning, video content may be completely delivered to the device and charged against the user's data plan regardless of whether it is viewed. With Buffer Tuning, a sufficient amount of video is delivered to the device so that the user can start viewing the video, and the remainder of the video is delivered just in time to the device as needed for uninterrupted viewing. This optimizes the user's data plan consumption. Additionally, this frees up network resources for all users. Buffer Tuning does not alter video content and should not directly introduce any adverse impact to the viewing experience.

Video Management. Another network management practice we use to efficiently manage our wireless network resources is Video Management, which is a feature we offer on most of our wireless data plans. By default, we aim to render content identified as streaming video in standard-definition (max of 1.5 to 2 Mbps), which is generally well suited to viewing on a smartphone. Plans that only include standard-definition (SD) streaming always have Video Management turned on, while other plans with HD or 4K UHD allow customers to manage and change Video Management settings online. Some video cannot be identified as video, and some video may be streamed faster or at higher definition. Sometimes, other content that content providers bundle with streaming video (such as video downloads, catalogs, lenses, and filters) may be impacted and slowed. Streaming and video resolution may vary depending on our capacity to identify it as such and are affected by other factors; and other restrictions may apply. For example, in instances where a content provider uses the same server name identification (SNI) or URL to deliver both streaming video and downloadable video, Video Management may treat the downloadable video and thereby affect the speed of the video download. If two or more tethered devices are watching video from the same source at the same time, we may identify it as a single video and slow the speeds collectively to a max of the speeds explained above, which may impair a customer's ability to watch video on these tethered devices. Customers can pause video on all but one of the tethered devices, watch video from different sources, or if able to manage video settings online, a customer may turn off Video Management to resolve this issue. Turning off Video Management may resolve this or other issues, and customers with this ability to manage settings online may also turn it off at any time to experience higher definition video (for example HD or 4K as applicable by your plan). With the feature turned off, a customer may use more data. More information is available at cricketwireless.com/support/account-management/videomanagement. If you are a provider of streaming video content and have questions about our video management policy, please contact us at [g05350@att.com](mailto:g05350@att.com).

**Does Cricket limit data usage? Does Cricket provide any tools to help customers monitor and control their data usage?**

We have developed speed tiers for our data plans for our mobile broadband internet access services so that our customers can choose from a variety of speed tiers or rate plans that best reflect their own usage levels, and the manner in which they intend to use their service. For example, some Cricket data plans designated for use only with a basic phone or smart phone may not be used with a LaptopConnect card, tablet, or stand-alone mobile hotspot device. However, customers wishing to use their service in such a manner, such as with a mobile hotspot device, may purchase other plans that permit such use. Cricket provides alerts and other tools for our mobile broadband internet access services to assist customers in estimating their anticipated usage levels. For more information, please click [here](https://www.cricketwireless.com/support/account-management/view-data-usage). In addition, we send notices to customers of applicable usage thresholds for our tiered mobile services. We have some plans that provide an allotment of high speed data to the specific line. Once customers on these plans exceed their allotments of high speed data - which includes the plan data, and, if applicable, any available Rollover Data, or other data allotments customers may have - during a billing period, depending on their plan they can either continue to consume data at no extra charge, but at significantly lower speeds when connected to the cellular network, or they will no longer have data to consume. In either scenario, customers can choose to purchase additional high speed data (for example, $10 for 1GB for the Cricket 10GB Plan). For customers on the former type of plan (those with no overage but significantly lower speeds after exhausting the monthly allotment of high-speed data) who use all available high speed data allotments in a billing cycle, the customer's service over the cellular network will transmit data at a maximum of 128Kbps for the remainder of the billing cycle. Once speeds are limited like this, the customer's connection over the cellular network should still allow viewing static web pages or checking email, but bandwidth-intensive activities such as audio and video streaming, picture and video messaging, and apps/services that use large amounts of data will be impacted and may not be fully functional. But, when the next billing cycle begins, the customer will once again have high speed data access. We will notify customers during each billing cycle when their data usage reaches either 75% or 90% of their monthly high speed allotment (or at both intervals), and when they reach 100% of their monthly high speed data allotment so that they are aware of their amount of data usage and can make adjustments to avoid slower speeds. When connected to a Wi-Fi network, the customer's speed will not be impacted. For information regarding these types of plans for consumers, [click here](https://www.cricketwireless.com/plans). Another way we help wireless customers manage their data usage is through the Video Management feature summarized above.

For those geographic areas that are not served by Cricket's owned and operated mobile networks, we try to provide customers with data services through agreements with other carriers. The use of customers' devices to access data over another carrier's networks - both domestic and international - is called "off-net", "off-network" or "roaming" usage. Our ability to make off-net or roaming services available to customers is based on a variety of dynamic factors, including business considerations, the terms of the agreements we have at any given time with other wireless carriers, and the network technology, frequency(ies) and functionality of those networks. We do not guarantee the availability, quality of coverage or speed for data services that are accessed using other carrier networks and we may reduce speeds to 2G speeds or suspend the data service available on these networks at any time without notice. We update our coverage maps regularly to show where we provide domestic off-net and international roaming services. To obtain the most recent coverage updates you may access the maps [here](http://www.cricketwireless.com/coverage "To obtain the most recent coverage updates you may access the maps here").

**How does Cricket handle alleged copyright infringement by subscribers to its broadband internet access services?**

The AT&T Copyright Alert Program was established by Cricket's parent company, AT&T, to respond to alleged copyright infringement activities using peer-to-peer file sharing and attempts to educate customers about the importance of protecting copyright and lawful use of content available over the internet. Under the program, content owners may notify AT&T of alleged copyright infringement based on the IP address of a user. AT&T then will attempt to identify a subscriber account based on that IP address and forward a copyright alert to the subscriber account, advising the account holder of the allegation and providing information about online copyright infringement. If a subscriber receives additional alerts, we may temporarily redirect the account holder's broadband internet access service to a webpage where the account holder must review material on the importance of copyright and the lawful use of content available over the internet. Upon completion of this review, such redirection will be discontinued and the subscriber's service will be restored to normal. After this stage, if a subscriber continues to receive additional alerts, then AT&T may take action consistent with Section 512(i) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which may result in termination of the subscriber/accountholder's broadband internet access service. Account holders' personally identifiable information is protected throughout this process - AT&T will not provide such information to content owners unless required to do so by court order. For more information about AT&T's Copyright Alert Program, please go to: [https://copyright.att.net/home](https://copyright.att.net/home "Copyright Alert Program").

**Does Cricket favor certain websites or internet applications by blocking, throttling, or modifying particular protocols on its broadband internet access service?**

No, Cricket does not favor certain websites or internet applications by blocking or throttling lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, application, service, user, or use of nonharmful devices on its broadband internet access services. Nor do we modify particular protocols, protocol ports, or protocol fields in ways not prescribed by the protocol standards. However, in response to a specific security threat against our network or our customers, Cricket may occasionally need to limit the flow of traffic from certain locations or take other appropriate actions. In addition, we prevent the use of certain ports on our Wi-Fi broadband internet access services to help protect our customers and network against malicious activity (see att.com/broadbandinfo for information on Wi-Fi broadband internet access services).

Our mobile broadband internet access service data plans may include different speeds, video streaming quality, and other options for consumers to choose the data plan that best fits their needs. For example, the Cricket 10GB and 5GB plans and the Cricket Simply Data plans allow users to turn Video Management off and stream video in the highest quality available, depending on the resolution streaming video services deliver and what network conditions may be, while the Cricket Unlimited plan allows for streaming Standard Definition (480p/DVD quality) video. Customers watching streaming video on a smartphone or other small hand-held device likely will not notice a significant difference between High-Definition and Standard Definition video quality, while those watching streaming video on a tablet or other larger device may prefer High-Definition video quality. For more information about our mobile broadband internet access service data plans available to consumers, please go to: [https://www.cricketwireless.com/plans](https://www.cricketwireless.com/plans).

**Does Cricket directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic (such as through prioritization, resource reservation, or traffic shaping) in its provision of broadband Internet access service either (1) in exchange for consideration (monetary or otherwise) from a third party, or (2) to benefit an affiliate?**

No, in its provision of broadband internet access services, Cricket does not directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic in exchange for consideration from a third party or to benefit an affiliate, except to address the needs of emergency communications, law enforcement, public safety (including FirstNet), or national security authorities, consistent with or as permitted by applicable law. Additionally, Cricket's parent company, AT&T, offers a wide variety of services to its customers, including but not limited to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Internet Protocol (IP)-video, unified messaging, Voice over LTE (VoLTE), AT&T Internet Air for Business Premium, AT&T Business Unlimited Premium, enterprise networking, public safety (including FirstNet®), and national security services. These services share AT&T's network infrastructure and may rely on network practices to assign different levels of priority. Use of these services may affect the availability of network resources for broadband internet access services, and thus the performance of that service. For example, your service may be interrupted, delayed, or otherwise limited in the event of a disaster or emergency, or during periods of congestion, to accommodate the needs of national security and emergency preparedness personnel.

**What practices has Cricket adopted to manage network security?**

Cricket takes the security of our customers and our network very seriously. We proactively monitor network activity to help guard against a wide range of security threats, including viruses, botnets, worms, distributed denial of service attacks, SPAM, and other harmful activity. We encourage customers to adopt their own security practices.

We use a variety of network tools to monitor network activity and health to maintain its stability and functionality, to protect the network against threats, and for other operational purposes. We store the information we gather through this monitoring for only as long as we have a business purpose to maintain it. The Cricket Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share this information. You can view Cricket's Privacy Policy at: [www.cricketwireless.com/privacy](http://www.cricketwireless.com/privacy).

If we detect a security threat, we will typically attempt to isolate the threat and minimize the impact to network service. We may use a variety of security measures to protect the network, including blocking malicious or unlawful traffic, redirecting the flow of traffic over some portions of our network, or taking other actions to address the threat. For example, as described in more detail below, we block certain ports that transfer malicious or disruptive traffic (such as Ports 25, 135, 139, 445, and 1900). We attempt to limit actions to the specific portions of our network or customer base impacted by the security threat and only for as long as necessary to mitigate the threat.

Cricket may scan or analyze network addresses that are registered through Cricket or AT&T, including addresses that may have been delegated to customers, and/or routes that originate from Cricket or AT&T-provided networks to detect vulnerabilities that might be used to compromise Cricket or AT&T or customer assets or might be used in attacks against others. In doing so, we seek to avoid disrupting network service to customers. We may use information derived from these activities to identify and address security issues or to notify customers of issues.

As noted above, Cricket blocks certain ports that transfer malicious or disruptive traffic to protect our customers and our network. Below is more information about port blocking that is currently in place. We may block additional ports in the future based upon threat assessments.  
 

| Port | Transport | Protocol | Direction | Threats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | TCP | Reserved | Both | Reserved Port |
| 19  | UDP | Chargen | Both | Reflective DDOS |
| 25  | TCP | SMTP | Outbound | SPAM, Malware |
| 68  | UDP | BOOTP | Outbound | DHCP server spoofing |
| 123 | UDP | NTP | Both | Reflective DDOS |
| 135 | TCP | NetBios | Both | Worms, Malware, Reflective DDoS |
| 139 | TCP | NetBios | Both | Worms, Malware |
| 445 | TCP | MS-DS SMB | Both | Worms, Malware |
| 520 | UDP | RIPv | Both | Reflective DDOS |
| 1900 | UDP | SSDP | Both | Reflective DDOS |
| 3479 | TCP | Twrpc | Both | End user device instability |
| 7547 | TCP | CWMP | Both | End user device instability |
| 49152 | TCP | Dynamic | Inbound | Unauthorized access, DoS |
| 49955 | TCP | Dynamic | Inbound | Unauthorized access, DoS |
| 50001 | TCP | Dynamic | Inbound | Unauthorized access, DoS |
| 51001 - 51003 | TCP | Dynamic | Inbound | Unauthorized access, DoS |
| 51010 - 51012 | TCP | Dynamic | Inbound | Unauthorized access, DoS |
| 51020 | TCP | Dynamic | Inbound | Unauthorized access, DoS |
| 61001 | TCP | IPDR | Both | Data exposure, end user device instability |

  
**Port 0/TCP**: Port 0 is a reserved port. This port should not be used for any applications. Blocking protects our customers from potentially harmful types of network abuses.

**Port 19/UDP**: Port 19 Chargen is a protocol designed to generate a stream of characters for debugging and measurement. Because more recent tools have been developed for measurement and debugging purposes, blocking protects against use of this port in Reflective DDOS attacks.

**Port 25/TCP**: Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) is used to send email. Port 25/TCP may be blocked from customers with dynamically-assigned Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to protect systems from becoming a mail relay for SPAM. Customers can subscribe to AT&T SMTP services if they need to host an SMTP server on the internet.

**Port 68/UDP**: Port 68 is used to obtain dynamic IP address information from a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server. Port 68 may be blocked to eliminate the risk of exposure to a rogue DHCP server.

**Port 123/UDP**: Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to accurately synchronize computer time of day to a reference time server. Some aspects of Port 123 may be limited to minimize malicious use. Poorly-configured NTP servers can be used for Reflective DDOS attacks, and some devices provide NTP service inadvertently, which exacerbates the port's malicious use.

**Port 135/TCP**: NetBIOS is a network file sharing protocol and is also known as Common Internet File System or LanManager. Blocking protects customers from exposing files unintentionally, worms, and viruses.

**Port 139/TCP**: NetBIOS is a network file sharing protocol and is also known as Common Internet File System or LanManager. Blocking protects customers from exposing critical system files unintentionally, which could give system access to a malicious actor.

**Port 445/TCP**: NetBIOS is a network file sharing protocol and is also known as Common Internet File System or LanManager. Blocking mitigates a potential threat to certain operating systems. Similar to our blocking of Ports 135 and 139, blocking Port 445 protects customers from exposing files unintentionally, worms, and viruses.

**Port 520/UDP**: RIPv1 - UDP port 520 is used by the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) to share network routing information. RIPv1 was designed to support route information sharing on small classful (class A, B, C, D) networks and has limited usefulness in today's classless networks. Port 520 has been used by malicious actors to generate Reflective DDOS attacks.

**Port 1900/UDP**: Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a protocol standard designed to allow device discovery over a local network. Some home routers may expose this port to the internet, which could allow attackers to defeat the security attributes of Network Address Translation (NAT) and allow attackers to use the port for Reflective DDOS attacks.

**Port 3479/TCP**: Twrpc is a protocol used for remote management of end user devices. Blocking this port protects customers from improper use of the port, which can cause end user device instability.

**Port 7547/TCP**: CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) is a protocol used for remote management of end user devices. Blocking this port protects customers from improper use of the port, which can cause end user device instability.

**Port 49152/TCP, 49955/TCP, 50001/TCP, 51001-51003/TCP, 51010-51011/TCP, 51020/TCP** : These ports are numbered from the dynamic/private ephemeral port range. Their use varies according to implementation and may include end-user device management. Blocking these ports protects customers from malicious activity, which may include data exposure or attacks against the end user devices.

**Port 61001/TCP**: Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) is a specification used to collect information from end user devices including device configuration data. Blocking TCP port 61001 prevents certain types of malicious activity including data exposure and end user device attacks.

**Does Cricket restrict the types of devices that customers can use with its mass market broadband internet access services?**

Customers of our mass market mobile services may attach 4G- and 5G-capable devices of their choice to our mobile broadband internet access services, so long as the devices are FCC-approved, compatible with the technology used in our mobile network, eligible on the customer's plan, and do not harm our network or other users. Cricket has retired its 2G and 3G networks and we will not activate 2G-only and/or 3G-only capable devices. Devices must also be used in a manner consistent with our terms of service and Acceptable Use Policy. For example, some data plans are designated for use with only a basic phone or smartphone, in which case customers may not use their device to provide an internet access connection to other equipment/devices (such as computers, netbooks, tablets, IOT devices, other phones, USB modems, network routers, media players, gaming consoles, or other data-capable devices) by tethering, by SIM card transfer, or any other means. However, customers wishing to use their service with a mobile hotspot or tablet may purchase a data plan that includes such use.

**Performance Characteristics**

**What factors affect the performance of my mass market mobile broadband internet access service?**

Cricket offers many mass market mobile broadband internet access service options, each of which may have a different service capability speed. The term speed is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the capacity at which a particular mass market mobile broadband internet access service can transmit data. This capacity is typically measured in the number of kilobits, megabits or gigabits that can be transmitted in one second (Kbps, Mbps or Gbps). Some applications, like a short email without attachments or basic web browsing, do not require high service capability speeds to function optimally. Other activities, like transferring large data files, can be performed faster with higher-speed services. Your service capability speed may not be suitable for some applications, particularly those involving real-time or near real-time, high-bandwidth uses such as streaming 4K video or video conferencing.

Because service performance varies on an end-to-end basis, Cricket's service capability speeds are limited to, and measured between, your location and a point on Cricket's network, which constitutes only one segment of the end-to-end transmission path connecting your location to internet websites or content providers. End-to-end performance of your service depends on a variety of factors, including: the number of subscribers simultaneously using the network; customer location; destination and traffic on the internet; Wi-Fi connectivity; the capabilities and performance of your Local Area Network (LAN); interference with high frequency spectrum on your telephone line; wiring inside your premises, office or apartment; the capacity or performance of your devices or modem; the server with which you are communicating; internal network management factors (including overhead, which refers to the various control and signaling data required to achieve the reliable transmission of internet access data); and the networks you and others are using when communicating.

Cricket's parent company, AT&T, offers a wide variety of services to its customers over AT&T's network infrastructure including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Internet Protocol (IP)-video, unified messaging, Voice over LTE (VoLTE), AT&T Internet Air for Business Premium, AT&T Business Unlimited Premium, enterprise networking, public safety (including FirstNet®), and national security services. These services share AT&T's network infrastructure and may rely on network practices to assign different levels of priority dynamically or statically. Use of these services may affect the availability of network resources for broadband internet access services, and thus the performance of that service. For example, your service may be interrupted, delayed, or otherwise limited in the event of a disaster or emergency, or during periods of congestion, to accommodate the needs of national security and emergency preparedness personnel. In addition, although Cricket engineers its network to accommodate all users and user types based on a variety of factors, including average and anticipated peak usage of the network, many factors cannot be anticipated or are outside of Cricket's control. These factors can impact the availability of network resources for mass market broadband internet access services at any particular time. Consequently, Cricket does not guarantee the performance of your service on an end-to-end basis.

Other factors that are relevant to specific services include, but are not limited to, the following:

* _Mobile Services_. Service performance may be affected by your proximity to a cell site, the capacity of the cell site, the technology at the cell site, the number of other users connected to the same cell site and the services they are using, the surrounding terrain, use inside a building or a moving vehicle, radio frequency interference, your mobile data plan, the capabilities of your device, applicable network management practices as discussed on this page, and the applications you use. In addition, Cricket has designed its wireless services to provide our customers with a high-quality voice experience during simultaneous voice and data sessions, which may affect data performance, including but not limited to a temporary reduction in speed to minimize the likelihood of dropped calls. In areas not served by Cricket's owned and operated mobile networks, customers may be able to access data via "roaming" on another carrier's network as Cricket has agreements with other wireless carriers. This off-network (or off-net) partner coverage roaming service and service quality is not guaranteed. We may reduce roaming data speeds to 2G or suspend service entirely at any time without notice. Please see cricketwireless.com/coverage for a coverage map.
* _Nationwide Wi-Fi Hotspot Services_. Wi-Fi hot spots are generally provided at a given site on behalf of the business owner or operator for the benefit of their patrons. It is common practice that the internet access is shared between both the business' patrons and the business' operational traffic. In some instances, business operational traffic may be prioritized to minimize the potential impact on critical communications, such as credit card processing. This prioritization may intermittently impact the speed available. Additionally, service performance may be affected by your proximity to a Wi-Fi hot spot, the capacity of the Wi-Fi equipment at the hot spot, the number of other users connected to the same site, the composition of the building where the hot spot is located (wood, concrete, etc.), radio frequency interference, the capabilities of your Wi-Fi capable device, the internet connection to the Wi-Fi hot spot, per-user bandwidth limits used to provide fair internet access at a hot spot, and speed tier options made available at the hot spot. For information on Nationwide Wi-Fi Hotspot Services, see att.com/broadbandinfo.

**Where can I find information about the performance of my mass market mobile broadband internet access service?**

Because many different factors can affect the performance of your mass market mobile broadband internet access service, Cricket does not guarantee specific performance levels (such as of speed or latency) for our mass market mobile broadband internet access services. We strive to manage our network to provide you optimal performance. The performance you can expect to receive from the mass market mobile broadband internet access services we offer is described below.

**Speed**

**Mobile Service:** 

Some Cricket mass market mobile broadband internet access services limit access to certain network technologies or impose a maximum speed limit, which is outlined in the applicable data service plan, subject to the factors described above that can affect mobile services performance (see "What factors affect the performance of my mass market mobile broadband internet access service") and the network management practices discussed on this page.  
  
Other plans provide access to all available network technologies and provide customers with the highest speed available from the network at a particular location and at a given point of time based on the capabilities of the customer's device, subject to the factors and network management practices discussed above. In addition, some service plans include maximum data transmission rates for traffic we can identify as video and/or for other data types. For example, the retired Cricket $55 unlimited plan limits data transmission rates to 3.0 Mbps, and most of our wireless plans strive to render streaming video in standard-definition (SD), with a max speed of 2 Mbps (for content we can identify as video and potentially other content that content providers bundle with video). If a data plan includes HD or 4K UHD, with the ability to manage video settings, customers can manage their video online and turn off the video treatment to get higher video resolution. Similarly, some Cricket plans provide customers a monthly per line allotment of mobile hotspot/tethering usage after which the data transmission rate for tethered data for that device will be limited to a significantly slower speed (e.g., 128 Kbps) for the remainder of the bill cycle, as set forth in the terms of the plan.

In no case does Cricket guarantee particular minimum speeds for its mass market mobile broadband internet access services. Speeds available are affected by many different factors that can impact wireless network performance as discussed above. Based on data compiled by Cricket through crowd-sourced speed tests, Cricket expects customers on plans without maximum speed limits will typically experience the following speeds, subject to location, device, and other factors as discussed above. Depending on plan terms, some video and other content may be slower due to Video Management. In addition, roaming data speeds may be lower.

The range reported is based on the 25th to the 75th percentile, which means that the 25th percentile lower bound is the value below which 25% of the test readings were, and the 75th percentile upper bound is the value below which 75% of the test readings were):

| Technology | Download Range (Mbps) | Upload Range (Mbps) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5G+ | 110-321 | 5-30 |
| 5G  | 34-184 | 3-22 |
| 4G LTE | 7-56 | 1-9 |

  
**Latency**

Latency, also known as delay, is the amount of time from when a data packet is sent by a user over the network to when a response back to the user is received. For mass market mobile broadband internet access services, latency is usually expressed as the round-trip time in milliseconds (ms) that it takes for a data packet to travel between two end points on the internet (from point A to point B and then back to point A). Some applications, such as email, can tolerate a substantial amount of latency without any noticeable impact on the application's performance. Other applications, such as real-time video conferencing, require lower latency levels to function properly. End-to-end latency reflects the cumulative effect of the individual latencies that occur along the end-to-end network path.

Although latencies can vary due to several factors, including some beyond Cricket's control, mass market mobile broadband internet access service customers can typically expect the following round-trip latencies when accessing the internet:

_Mobile Service:_

Based on data compiled by Cricket through crowd-sourced performance tests that measure latency to the closest geographical server to the customer, Cricket expects customers will typically experience the following latency, subject to location, device, and other factors as discussed above (the range reported is based on the 25th to the 75th percentile, which means that the 25th percentile lower bound is the value below which 25% of the test readings were, and the 75th percentile upper bound is the value below which 75% of the test readings were):

| Technology | Latency Range (ms) |
| --- | --- |
| 5G+ | 21-38 |
| 5G  | 27-47 |
| 4G LTE | 31-54 |
