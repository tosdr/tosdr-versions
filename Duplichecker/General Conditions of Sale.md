The customers who have purchased the subscription plans of DupliChecker’s pro services can claim for a refund if they aren’t satisfied with the selected plan or quality of service. We advise all of our users to go through this refund policy before purchasing any of our plans.

Return
------

The plan that a user is returning must have a major proportion of queries unused to claim a refund.

**Weekly Subscribers:** Renewable and Non-Renewable Subscriptions do not subject to any refund for weekly plans.

**Monthly Subscribers:** Users can claim the refund within 15 days of purchase.

DupliChecker will not be responsible for any dispute or refund after the given time span even if the package remains 100% unused.

Refund Process
--------------

If you comply with our Refund Policy, you can get a refund for your purchased plan by using the Contact Us form of DupliChecker. Our customer service representative will contact you at your given email address at earliest after receiving your refund request.

The plan you are asking for a refund will be assessed to figure out the proportion of your plan that is unused. Once we are done with this process, you will be notified whether your request qualifies for the refund. The refund payment will be transferred to you within 5-7 working days.

Non-Refundable
--------------

In some cases, the users cannot claim for a refund, which include the following:

* No refunds are made on special offers and discounted plans.
* Non-renewable plans are also NOT subjected to any refunds.
* Add-ons are totally non-refundable.

Repayment Conditions
--------------------

The payment for refunded plans will be processed and transferred to the same channel through which it was received. The bank charges will be deducted from the refundable amount. Our team will analyze the consumption history of your plan; the number of queries and words checked will affect the repayable amount, as we will deduce it from the actual price of the plan.

Manual Cancellation
-------------------

The customers who wish to discontinue using our services can do so by following one of the given ways:

* The users can cancel their subscriptions from their profiles.
* The users can use the Contact Us form and ask for the cancellation of their subscriptions. (If you contact us for cancellation, it will take around 2-3 days to process your request.)

Cancellation of Service
-----------------------

[DupliChecker](https://www.duplichecker.com/) holds the right to cancel the user’s subscription under the following circumstances:

* A user breaks terms and conditions.
* The user doesn’t follow the usage patterns established by DupliChecker.
* If the user has submitted the request to our customer service.
* User has attempted to infect the reputation or any work of DupliChecker.
* If we receive abuse requests related to a user’s actions from law enforcement agencies.

**Note:** This Refund Policy can be modified, altered, or completely changed without any prior notice to the users. The users should buy any plan of DupliChecker after going through the Refund Policy in detail.
