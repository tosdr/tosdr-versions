This cookie policy (“**Cookie Policy**”) describes the cookies that Kid Distro Holdings, LLC (dba DistroKid) (“**DistroKid**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) uses on our website [https://distrokid.com](https://distrokid.com/) (“**Site**”) and the choices that you have. This Cookie Policy forms part of our [Privacy Policy](https://distrokid.com/privacy). Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we use your personal data.  
By choosing to use the Site after having been notified of our use of cookies in the ways described in this Cookie Policy, and, in applicable jurisdictions, through notice and unambiguous acknowledgement of your consent, you agree to such use.  
**COOKIES**  
A “cookie” is a piece of information sent to your browser by a website you visit.  
Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time. Some cookies expire after a certain amount of time, or upon logging out (session cookies), others survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the third party placing it), and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again (persistent cookies). Our Site uses first party cookies (cookies set directly by DistroKid) as well as third party cookies, as described below. For more details on cookies please visit [All About Cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).  
We also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies), from the third parties and for the purposes described below. Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message.
