12.  **Subscription Services**

a.    In order to enjoy certain advanced features of our Services, including the ability to store video and/or audio footage or photographs in cloud storage, download them to your mobile device, or receive certain types of enhanced notifications, you must activate the Subscription Services, such as the Furbo Dog Nanny®.   If you sign up for one of our special offer such as “Subscribe and Save plans” or “Premium Safety Package plan”, you have agreed to a minimum subscription of three or more continuous months (“Minimum Commitment”).  We will charge the subscription fee upfront for a minimum of three or more months depending on the purchase plan you choose. You must first complete the activation process once you receive the Hardware Product in order to enjoy the Subscription Services.  You will not be able to access or use any feature of the Hardware Product without activation.  After the Minimum Commitment, your Subscription Services will continue monthly, annually or biennially, based on the plan you selected. Your Subscription Term will automatically renew until terminated by you or us.   After you terminate the Subscription Services, or if you purchase the Camera Only without the Subscription Services, you will only be able to access a real-time stream of the area where the Hardware Product is located for the limited purpose of recording.  You will not be able to access any past recordings, nor can you activate the Subscription Services retroactively. If you or an Authorized User delete any data collected as a result of the Subscription Services, the data will be permanently deleted and no longer available to you. Please note that Tomofun may charge an additional fee for the use of some or all of the Subscription Services. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, terminate, or change the Subscription Services at any time.

b.    **Subscription.**  You can find a description of our Subscription Services on our website ( [https://help.furbo.com/hc/en-us](https://help.furbo.com/hc/en-us) ), and we will explain which Subscription Service options are available to you when you sign up for the Furbo Dog Nanny or other services we offer. Your Subscription Services will continue month-to-month, annually, or based on the other timescale subscription plan (the “Subscription Term”) that you select, and will automatically renew until terminated. You will be entitled to access the subscription-based Services you purchased for each Subscription Term until such subscription is canceled. To change or discontinue a Purchase, please go to the website ([https://furbo.com/account](https://furbo.com/account)). To use the Subscription service you must provide us with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time and which may include payment through your account with a third party. You must cancel your Subscription Services before it renews to avoid billing of the next period’s fees to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). 

If you purchase our hardware product through the special offer such as "Subscribe & save"or “Premium Safety Package”  plan, you shall subscribe to our service according to the selected purchase plan, the minimum subscription period is three months or more (depends on the plan you chose). If the user does not subscribe for the minimum required period, we reserve the right to block their access to the service until they renew their subscription for the required period.

c.     **Free Trial.** Your Subscription Service may start with a trial period to use the Subscription Service at no cost (“Free Trial”). The Free Trial period of your Subscription Service lasts for one month, or as otherwise specified during sign-up and is intended to allow new subscribers to try our Subscription Service.

Free Trial eligibility is determined by Tomofun at its sole discretion and we may limit eligibility or duration to prevent Free Trial abuse. We reserve the right to revoke the Free Trial and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Tomofun Subscription Services are not eligible. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Tomofun Subscription Services to determine eligibility.

d.    **Billing Cycle**. The Subscription Services will be charged based on the Subscription Term you select to your Payment Method on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of the paying portion of your Subscription until your Subscription is cancelled. For example, if you sign up for a monthly subscription on January 15, you will be charged again on February 15 for the next month of the Subscription Services.

e.    **Payment Methods**. To use the Subscription Services you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s). You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your Subscription Services. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the Subscription Services until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

 If you purchase any Hardware Products by selecting the plan of "subscribe & save"  or “Premium Safety Package” , we will charge you for at least the first three months or more, depending on the purchase plan you choose at the time when you activate the hardware for the first time.

f.      **Cancellation**. To cancel, go to the "Account" page on our website(https://furbo.com/account) and follow the instructions for cancellation. You can cancel your auto-renewal for your Subscription Services at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Subscription Services through the end of your Subscription Term. You must cancel your subscription-based Services at least 24 hours before the next Subscription Term to avoid further charges. Unless you cancel auto-renewal for your subscription, the Subscription Services will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the Subscription Term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial Subscription Term. If you cancel your Subscription Services, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period for your Subscription Term.

It is your responsibility to backup any data, software, or other materials you may have stored or preserved via your use of the Subscription Services. If you cancel your Subscription Services you will lose basic features of our Subscription Services and you will permanently lose such data, software, or other materials as they will be deleted after your Subscription Services end. Tomofun will not be responsible for any such damage or loss.

g.    **Changes to the Price and Subscription Terms**. We reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your Subscription Services will take effect following notice to you.

**h.**     **Refunds for Subscription Services.** Payments for Subscription Services are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, unless required by the laws of the region where you reside.

28. **Dispute Resolution and Waiver of Class Action and Jury Rights**

The following applies only to those users that reside in the United States of America or Canada:

You understand and agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement, including your use and access to the Services or any other content, including, but not limited to, claims as to whether any services rendered by Tomofun or persons employed or engaged by Tomofun were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered, shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s ("AAA") Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process, except as California law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. It is your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees as set forth in the AAA Rules.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BOTH PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ARE GIVING UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTE DECIDED IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR ANY OTHER PRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

The parties further agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this agreement to arbitrate. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, unless both parties otherwise agree in writing. The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco County, California, U.S.A.

You may cancel this agreement to arbitrate by giving written notice to Tomofun within 30 days of the date of your acceptance of this Agreement, or 30 days after Tomofun makes material changes to this section of this Agreement. You should send your cancellation notice to [support@furbo.com](mailto:support@furbo.com) with the following information: (i) your name, (ii) your Tomofun account email address; (iii) your mailing address; (iv) a statement of your wish not to resolve disputes with Tomofun through arbitration. Your notice to opt-out of arbitration only applies to this Agreement; if you previously entered into other arbitration agreements with Tomofun or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the arbitration terms of this Agreement shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and Tomofun. Should you choose to withdraw from the arbitration provision, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than arbitration, each party waives any right to a jury trial. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts of San Francisco County in the State of California or a United States District Court for the Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.
