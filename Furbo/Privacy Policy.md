For example, when you enable the Smart Alerts, Cloud Recording, Doggie Diary, and other Furbo features on our Services, we may use artificial intelligence to analyze your Content for sound and motion to be able to send you the notifications you request. Please visit the Furbo website to learn more. We engage third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples may include providing technical assistance, customer service, marketing assistance, and administration of promotional programs.

For example, when you enable Smart Dog Alerts on your account, we use your Content data to test and refine our artificial intelligence algorithms. When we use your personal information for research and product development, we take on additional security measures to protect your personal information, such as de-identifying or pseudonymizing your information, limiting access to personnel that may conduct research and development, and applying other technical, physical, and administrative security measures. Once we have de-identified your personal information, we will not attempt to re-identify it, except for the sole purpose of determining if its de-identification process is satisfactory.

Please note, we may seek to verify your identity when we receive an individual rights request from you in order to ensure the security of your personal information.

* **Right to Withdraw Your Consent.** If we ever asked for your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. A withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of our processing or the processing of any third parties based on consent before your withdrawal.
* **Right of Access.** Upon your request, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information in our files without undue delay and free of charge, unless we permitted by law to charge a fee. Your access may be limited to the extent it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals.
* **Right to Rectification (or “Correction”).** You may request to correct or update any of your personal information in our files. We may provide you with the ability to update some or all of your personal information directly via the Services.
* **Right to Erasure (or the “Right to be Forgotten”).** Upon your request, we will erase any of your personal information in our files that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.
* **Right to Restriction**. You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where one of the following conditions applies:

* You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. If you restrict processing based on this condition, you may experience an interruption of some or all of the Services during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information;
* The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead;
* We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or
* You have objected to processing, pending the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of our processing override your rights.

During the time which restriction of processing applies, we will only process your restricted personal information with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when the restriction is lifted.

* **Right to Object.** You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal bases of: consent; contract; or legitimate interests. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.

Your right to data portability only applies to personal information provided by you to us.
* **Notification to Third Parties.** When we fulfill your individual rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure, or restriction of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant personal information unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.
* **Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling.** You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless an exception applies under applicable law.
