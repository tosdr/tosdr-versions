Applicable Laws
---------------

As an entity established in Estonia, part of the EU, the main privacy laws that are applicable to Us in so far as You are concerned, are as follows: The Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of such Data – the “GDPR”.

All the above are referred to together as the “Data Protection Laws” (DPL) and/or the “GDPR”.

What is Personal Data?
----------------------

“PERSONAL DATA” means any information that identifies You as an individual or that relates to an identifiable individual.  
  
Whenever it is not possible or feasible for us to make use of anonymous and/or anonymised data (in a manner that does not identify any users of the Website or customers of our Services), We are nevertheless committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your personal data at all times.  
  
We collect personal data in various ways both digitally via the website (either when you choose to provide us with certain data or in some cases automatically and/or via third parties) as well as non-digitally (for example when you fill in a physical form to benefit from one or more of our services).

There are certain instances at law where we are specifically forbidden from disclosing to you such activity (for example, when carrying out due diligence for anti-money laundering purposes). When acting as a data processor, Chromatic processes personal data on behalf of one or more data controllers. In such cases it is the data controller’s obligation to provide data subjects with the said information. In case of uncertainty over who the data controller is, please contact us.

We may periodically ask you to confirm the accuracy of the records we hold, especially if there is a corresponding privacy and/or security risk justifying to do so.

Please note, that data sent via the Internet may be transmitted across international borders even where both sender and receiver of information are located in GDPR-compliant countries. We cannot be held responsible for any misuse of personal data prior to our receiving it or after our sending it, when the personal data from you to us (or vice versa) is transferred via a non-GDPR-compliant country.

Authorised Disclosures
----------------------

We reserve the right to disclose (and otherwise process) any relevant personal data which we may be processing (including IP addresses, in special circumstances) to authorised third parties in or outside the EU/EEA, if such disclosures are allowed under the Data Protection Laws (whether or not you gave us permission to do so):

6\. To comply with any legal obligations such as may arise by way of response to any court subpoena or order or similar official request for personal data;  
7\. As may otherwise be specifically allowed or required by or under any applicable law (for example, under anti-money laundering legislation).

Security Measures
-----------------

The personal information which we may hold (and/or transfer to any affiliates/partners/subcontractors as the case may be) will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the GDPR. We take reasonable steps to safeguard the confidentiality of any and/or all personal data that we process.  
  
We regularly review and enhance our technical, physical and managerial procedures to ensure that your personal data is protected from:  
• unauthorised access  
• improper use or disclosure  
• unauthorised modification  
• unlawful destruction or accidental loss.  
  
To this end we have implemented security policies, practices, and technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data that we may have under our control. All our members, staff and data processors (including specific subcontractors, including cloud service providers, who may have access to and are associated with the processing of personal data, are further obliged (under contract) to respect the confidentiality of our users’ or clients’ personal data as well as other obligations as imposed by the GDPR. Despite all our efforts, we cannot guarantee that a data transmission or a data storage system can ever be 100% secure. For more information about our security measures, please contact us in the manner described below.  
  
Authorised third parties, and external/third party service providers, with permitted access to your information (as explained in this Privacy Policy) are specifically required to apply appropriate technical and organisational security measures that may be necessary to safeguard the personal data being processed from unauthorised or accidental disclosure, loss or destruction and from any unlawful forms of processing.  
  
These service providers (our data processors) are also bound by a number of other obligations in line with the GDPR (in particular, [Article 28](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) of the GDPR). For the avoidance of all doubt, these are the same obligations that we are bound by when acting as data processor on behalf of one or more data controllers.

Sharing of Personal Data with Third Parties
-------------------------------------------

Relevant data will also be disclosed or shared as appropriate (and in all cases in line with the GDPR) to/with members and staff of Chromatic, to/with affiliated entities and/or subcontractors if pertinent to any of the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy (including to/with our services providers who facilitate the functionality of the site and/or any service you may require).  
  
Personal information will only be shared by us to provide the services you request or for any other lawful reason (including authorised disclosures not requiring your consent). Any such authorised disclosures will be done in accordance with the GDPR (for example all our processors are bound by the requirements of GDPR, including a strict obligation to keep any information they receive confidential and to ensure that their employees/personnel are also bound by similar obligations).  
  
The said service providers (our processors) are also bound by a number of other obligations (in particular, [Article 28](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) of the GDPR). Your personal data will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes (unless you explicitly authorise us to do so). The list of third parties to whom we may disclose to and/or share your personal data with is available on request.

Retention Periods
-----------------

We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary (taking into consideration the purpose for which it was originally obtained). The criteria we use to determine what is ‘necessary’ depends on the particular personal data in question and the specific relationship we have with you (including its duration).  
  
Our normal practice is to determine whether there is/are any specific EU and/or Estonian law(s) (for example tax or corporate laws) permitting or obliging us to keep certain personal data for a certain period of time (in which case we will keep the personal data for the maximum period indicated by any such law).  
  
For example, any data that can be deemed to be ‘accounting records’ must be kept for at least six years (plus current year). We would also have to determine whether there are any laws and/or contractual provisions that may be invoked against us by you and/or third parties and if so, what the prescriptive periods for such actions are (this is usually 6 years, plus current year). In the latter case, we will keep any relevant personal data that we may need to defend ourselves against any claim(s), challenge(s) or other such action(s) by you and/or third parties for such time as is necessary.  
  
Where your personal data is no longer required by us, we will either securely delete or anonymise the personal data in question.

Processing for Statistical Purposes
-----------------------------------

We use research and statistics data based on user or client information to better understand our users’ and clients’ needs, to develop and improve our services, our marketing and other operational activities. We will always make sure to obtain any consent we legally require from you. We will also ensure to implement all appropriate safeguards to keep your data secure.

Links to Third-party Sources
----------------------------

Links that we provide to third-party websites are clearly marked and we are not in any way whatsoever responsible for the content of such websites (including any applicable privacy policies or data processing practices). We suggest that you read the privacy policies of any such third-party websites.

Cookies
-------

When you visit our website, use our apps or software systems, we collect certain categories of personal data automatically through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies.  
  
For more detailed information, including what cookies are and how and why we process such data in this manner (including the difference between essential and non-essential cookies) please read our [Cookie Policy](http://www.chromatic.ee/cookie-policy).

Children
--------

Our website(s), apps and services are not intended to be used by any persons under the age of eighteen (18) and therefore we will never intentionally collect any personal data from such persons. If you are under the age of consent, please consult and get your parents' or legal guardians' permission to use the website, apps to use any of our services.

Your Rights Under the Data Protection Laws
------------------------------------------

Before addressing any of your requests, we may first need to verify your identity. In all cases we will try to respond to your request as timely as reasonably possible. As explained in the Retention Periods section above, we may need to keep certain personal data for compliance with our legal retention obligations, but also to complete transactions that you have requested prior to the change or deletion that you requested.  
  
Please note that when acting as a data processor, Chromatic processes personal data on behalf of one or more data controllers. In such cases queries will generally be directed to our client(s) or partner(s) – the data controller(s).  
  
When we act as a data controller, your various legal rights include:

### Your Right of Access

You may request us to confirm whether or not we are processing your personal data and, if we are, you have the right to access that personal data and to the following information:  
  
• What personal data we hold,  
• Why we process them,  
• To whom we disclose them,  
• For how long we intend to keep them,  
• Whether we transfer them abroad and the safeguards we take to protect them,  
• What your relevant rights are,  
• How you can make a complaint,  
• From where we obtained your personal data,  
• Whether we have carried out any automated decision-making (including profiling) based on the related information.  
  
Upon request, we shall (without adversely affecting the rights and freedoms of others, including our own) provide you with a copy of your personal data within one month of receipt of your request, which period may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. We will inform you of any such extension and the reasons for the delay within one month of receipt of the request.

### Your Right to Rectification

You have the right to rectify your personal data. You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal data and to complete your incomplete personal data. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.

### Your Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")

You have the right to ask us to delete your personal data and we shall comply without undue delay but only where:  
• The personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected; or  
• You have withdrawn your consent (in those cases where we process on the basis of your consent) and we have no other legal ground to process your personal data; or  
• You shall have successfully exercised your right to object (as explained below); or  
• Your personal data have been processed unlawfully; or  
• There is a legal obligation to which we are subject; or  
• Special circumstances exist in connection with certain children’s rights.  
  
Please note, that we are not legally bound to comply with your erasure request if the processing of your personal data is necessary:  
• for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject (including but not limited to our data retention obligations); or  
• for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.  
  
There are other legal grounds entitling us to refuse erasure requests, although the two instances above are the most likely grounds that may be invoked by us to deny such requests.

### Your Right to Data Restriction

You have the right to ask us to restrict the use of your personal data (i.e. keep, but not further process) but only where:  
• The accuracy of your personal data is contested (see the right to data rectification above), for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the personal data; or  
• The processing is unlawful and You oppose the erasure of your personal data; or  
• We no longer need the personal data for the purposes for which they were collected but You need the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or  
• You exercised your right to object and verification of our legitimate grounds to override your objection is pending.  
  
Following your request for restriction, except for storing your personal data, we may only process your personal data:  
• Where we have your consent; or  
• For the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or  
• For the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or  
• For reasons of important public interest.

### Your Right to Data Portability

You have the right to ask us to provide your personal data (that you shall have provided to us) to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or (where technically feasible) to have it transferred directly to another data controller, provided this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

### Your Right to Withdraw Consent (when we rely on consent )

In those cases, where our legal basis to process your data is your explicit consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and in the same manner as you have provided it to us. Should you exercise your right to withdraw your consent (by writing to us at the physical or email address below), we will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal basis exists for processing your data (for example, on the basis of a legal obligation to which we are subject) where we would be legally authorised or required to process your personal data without needing your consent and if so, notify you accordingly.  
  
When we ask for such personal data, you may always decline, however should you decline to provide us with that necessary data we require to provide the services you require, we may not necessarily be able to provide you with such services (especially if consent is the only legal ground that is available to us).

### Your Right to Object to Certain Processing

We only process your personal data when this is  
1.) necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or  
2.) when processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. You have the right to object to processing of your personal data by us.  
  
Where an objection is entered, the processing of data shall cease, unless we as data controller provide compelling and legitimate grounds requiring the continuation of the data processing which outweigh the objections you may have raised. When your data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.  
  
Please note, that this general right to object does not subsist when we process your personal data because it is necessary for the performance of a contract, when necessary for legal compliance or when processing of the data is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another natural person.

### Your Right to Lodge a Complaint

You also have the right to lodge complaints with the appropriate Data Protection Supervisory Authority. The competent authority in Estonia is the  Data Protection Inspectorate ('DPI'). You can contact them to make a complaint [here](https://www.aki.ee/en/contacts).  
  
We kindly ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues you may have with us first. Even though, as stated above, you have a right to contact the competent authority at any time.

### What We May Require from You

As one of the security measures we implement, before being able to legally help you exercise your rights as described above, we may need to verify your identity to ensure that we do not disclose to or share any personal data with any unauthorised individuals.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right, at our complete discretion, to change, modify, add to and/or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. If you are an existing client with whom we have a contractual relationship, you will be informed by us of any changes made to this Privacy Policy (as well as other [terms and conditions](http://www.chromatic.ee/terms-and-conditions) relevant to the use of our Website(s), Apps or Software Systems. We will also archive and store previous versions of the Privacy Policy for your review.
