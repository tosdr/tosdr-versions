Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination

We have the right but not the obligation to take any of the following actions, including pursuant to when we detect, or are notified of, any activity or Content uploaded to the Website that infringes applicable laws, rights of third parties, or these Terms of Service. When deciding on appropriate action, we consider all relevant factors such as the frequency, severity, and impact of a violation, as well as any measures previously imposed on an infringer:

* Issue a written warning to the infringer. Before we temporarily or permanently suspend an infringer’s access to our services following provision of manifestly illegal Content or action by such infringer we may issue a warning to the infringer, provided such warning would not conflict with the purposes of the moderation decision. Examples of misuse that may be sanctioned with a suspension or termination include, but are not limited to, the frequent uploading of Content that violates applicable law, third party rights, or these Terms of Service, or the uploading of Content that manifestly and severely violates applicable law, third party rights, or these Terms of Service, such as Child Sexual Abuse Material or revenge porn.
* Restrict the visibility or other accessibility of Content.
* Restrict the access of, suspend, or terminate a User’s account.
* Restricting, suspending, or otherwise terminating a Content Partner or Model’s ability to monetize their Content.
* Restricting, suspending, or withholding earnings and payouts.
* Report the infringer to law enforcement authorities.

We may also:

* remove or refuse to post any Content you submit or contribute to this Website for any or no reason in our sole discretion, including, without limitation, if any information or documentation provided by you is inadequate, incomplete, or inaccurate or does not allow us to assess and confirm your identity.
* monitor any communication occurring on or through this Website to confirm compliance with these Terms of Service, the security of this Website, or any legal obligation;
* take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of this Website.

If we have reason to believe that Content violates any applicable law, third party right, or these Terms of Service, we may take appropriate interim actions (as described herein), to prevent potential harm to our further investigation. In deciding on the appropriate and proportionate course of action, we will give due consideration to the legitimate interests of the impacted User, any other potentially affected rights holders, and our own legitimate interests. In particular, we will assess the nature of the Content concerned, the gravity of the respective violation or illegality, and any indications on whether or not the Content contributor was at fault. In case an investigation was prompted following report by a User, we will also consider the explanatory information and evidence provided by such User and, if available, the reporting User’s submission history.

We use a variety of procedures and tools to identify, review and moderate Content. This includes both human and automated review, or a combination of both, depending on what is appropriate and required in each individual case.

Automated review may include the use of systems which assist us in identifying infringing Content, determining the prioritization of certain issues, and applying appropriate measures. Content may be compared against databases of digitally finger-printed content and other, similar repositories, such as (but not limited to) YouTube’s CSAI Match. Automated review may be subject to further, manual verification, in the context of which Content and measures may be reassessed.

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any Content on or through this Website. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD US, OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY US AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DISCLOSING PERSONAL INFORMATION IN RELATION TO DATA DISCLOSURE REQUESTS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

This Website takes a powerful stand against any form of child exploitation or human trafficking. If we discover that any Content involves underage individuals, or any form of force, fraud, or coercion, we will remove the Content and submit a report to the proper law enforcement authorities. If you become aware of any such Content, you agree to report it to this Website by contacting [legal@youporn.com](mailto:legal@youporn.com).

To maintain our services in a manner we deem appropriate for our venue and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, this Website may, but will not have any obligation to display, reject, refuse to post, store, maintain, accept, or remove any Content posted (including, without limitation, private messages, public comments, public group chat messages, private group chat messages, or private instant messages) by you, and we may, in our sole discretion, delete, move, re-format, remove, or refuse to post or otherwise make use of Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of this Website in an appropriate manner. In addition, this Website may, but will not have any obligation to, review and monitor private messages, public comments, public group chat messages, private group chat messages, or private instant messages posted by you. Without limitation, we may do so to address Content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms of Service or any applicable additional terms, including, without limitation, the Content restrictions set forth herein.

We assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or Content provided by any User or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or non-performance of the activities described in this section.

* The Content to which our decision related did not in fact violate applicable law, third party rights, or these Terms of Service.
* Our prior decision to not act on a notice was unjustified.
* Our prior decision was unjustified or disproportionate in any other manner.

Abuse of Reporting and/or Complaint Handling System

We may suspend your access to our reporting and internal complaint-handling systems for a reasonable period of time if you frequently submit notices or complaints that are manifestly unfounded. Prior to such suspension we may issue a warning, provided that this does not conflict with the purpose of the suspension or with other, appropriate measures that may be applied. When deciding on the suspension, we consider factors such as the frequency, severity, and impact of your violation(s), as well as any prior measures imposed. Examples of misuse of our reporting and/or complaint-handling system that may be subject to suspension include, but are not limited to:

* Frequently submitting multiple, identical, and unfounded notices or complaints.

Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights (US)

This section shall only apply to Users located in the United States of America.

Except as set forth hereinabove, you and we agree that we will resolve any disputes between us (including any disputes between you and a third-party agent of ours) through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us or you and a third-party agent of ours (each a "**Claim**") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA Rules**"). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. However, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Service including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

This arbitration agreement under this section does not preclude either party from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms of Service, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms of Service.

Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator may not issue a “public injunction” and any such “public injunction” may be awarded only by a federal or state court. If either party seeks a “public injunction,” all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a “public injunction” in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party’s claim or prayer for “public injunctive relief.” In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.

If any provision of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this section of the Terms of Service will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms of Service. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

Back to Top

Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights (EU)

This section shall only apply to Users located in the European Union.

We cooperate with out-of-court dispute settlement bodies (“**Dispute Settlement Bodies**”) that have been certified in accordance with Art. 21(3) of the DSA. The European Commission publishes a list of these bodies.

If you have your place of establishment or are located in the European Union, you have the right to select a Dispute Settlement Body to assist in resolving disputes relating to decisions previously taken by us regarding Content uploaded by you, or notices you submitted to us. This includes cases in which complaints have remained unresolved by our internal complaint-handling system, as described in section “Complaint Handling Procedure”.

We reserve the right to refuse to cooperate with your selected Dispute Settlement Body if:

* A dispute has already been resolved or is already subject to an ongoing procedure before a competent court of relevant jurisdiction, or before another Dispute Settlement Body.
* The Dispute Settlement Body has been contacted after the six-month period from notification to you of our decision has lapsed, and you have not previously filed a complaint through our internal complaint-handling system over a particular issue.

Any decisions taken by Dispute Settlement Bodies shall not be binding on either you or us.

We are neither willing nor obligated to participate in dispute resolution proceedings with consumers before a consumer arbitration board under the EU Directive on Consumer ADR.

Miscellaneous

These Terms of Service, your use of this Website, and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Cyprus, without regard to conflict of law rules. Nothing contained in these Terms of Service shall constitute an agreement to the application of the laws of any other nation to this Website. You agree that this Website shall be deemed a passive Website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the Republic of Cyprus. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms of Service shall be in an appropriate court located in Limassol, Cyprus. You hereby submit to the jurisdiction and venue of said Courts.

No waiver by us of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by us to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect.

The Terms of Service, our [Privacy Notice](https://www.youporn.com/information/#privacy), our [Copyright Policy](https://www.youporn.com/information/#dmca) and any documents they expressly incorporate by reference constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and us with respect to this Website.

We may terminate these Terms of Service for any or no reason at any time by notifying you through a notice on this Website, by email, or by any other method of communication. Any such termination will be without prejudice to our rights, remedies, claims, or defenses hereunder. Upon termination of the Terms of Service, you will no longer have a right to access your account or your Content. We will not have any obligation to assist you in migrating your data or your Content and we may not keep any back up of any of your Content. We undertake no responsibility for deleting your Content under these Terms of Service.

We process browser and operating system information, devices you use to access Youporn and your time zone setting. We also process online identifiers. Specifically, we process internet protocol (IP) address information and we set cookies as explained below in the section on _Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Technologies_ and as described in our [Cookie Notice](https://www.youporn.com/information/cookie-notice).
* **Identifiers:** Some users may be asked to provide identifiers (including government-issued photo identification as well as other documentation) to verify that they are over the age of majority required to have access to Youporn and to view the content. In such cases, this information is processed by trusted third party age verification service providers. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of these third-party age verification service providers. Read the privacy terms and conditions of these third-party service providers carefully.

Persons who choose to create an account on Youporn (“**Registered Users**”): we process the same categories of information described above for Unregistered Users, and additionally the following information:

* **Contact Information:** We process usernames and email addresses. If you choose to register through a third-party platform, we will collect certain personal information from those platforms.
* **User Submitted Personal Information:** We process information you submit to personalize your account or for a specific function, for example your date of birth, age, gender, your interests, preferences, feedback, survey responses, your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties, and your communication preferences, as well as any other information which you voluntarily provide to us at your direction for a specific function.
* **Identifiers and Biometric Information:** You may be asked to provide identifiers (including government-issued photo identification as well as other documentation) to verify your identity and that you are over the age of majority required to access Youporn and to view the content.

Youporn is forbidden of access to persons under the age of 18 or the applicable age of majority in the jurisdiction from which Youporn is accessed (“**minors**”), and we therefore prohibit minors from using Youporn. As indicated throughout this Privacy Notice, some users may be asked to provide some information to us and our service providers to verify that you are over the age of majority required to have access to Youporn and to view the content. We do not knowingly process personal information from minors.

5\. Our Legal Bases Under Canadian and European Union (EU) Privacy Law

To the extent required by applicable law, we rely on several lawful bases to use your data in these ways. This means we process your personal data only where:

* It is necessary to perform our contract with you: for example, to create your account and provide our services.
* It is necessary to comply with our legal obligations: for example, we may be required to collect, use, or disclose your information in connection with civil, criminal, corporate, taxation, regulatory matters, or litigation.
* It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests): for example, to keep Youporn safe and secure from fraud and illegal activities.
* It is used to protect your or others’ vital interests: for example, in case of emergency or to prevent a crime or fraud.
* It is used for tasks carried out in the public interest: for example, to combat unlawful behaviour where it is in the public interest to do so and where the public interest is laid down by applicable law.

Depending on the circumstances, we may rely on different legal bases when processing your same information for different purposes. If you reside outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“UK”), the legal bases on which we rely may differ from those listed above.

* You can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of Youporn because such information may be required for you to register as a member; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on Youporn.
* The Cookie Banner can be utilized to customize your cookie preferences. The Cookie Banner will record when you have consented to our cookies. For logged in users, we will ask for consent once a year or when we have major changes to our cookies, to ensure you stay up to date with changes to our cookies and privacy policies. For non-logged in users, your Cookie Banner selection will be kept only for the specific session. The Cookie Banner specifically controls the Functionality, Analytics, and Advertising cookies set by using Youporn. Strictly necessary cookies cannot be disabled, nor can the tool be used to block cookies on third party websites linked from Youporn.
* You can access the Cookie Banner anytime by clicking on the ‘Manage cookies’ option that is located at the footer of Youporn.
* You can opt out of receiving marketing emails from us using the opt-out link provided in our emails or by changing your preferences in your account settings. You may use your account settings to delete your user contributions and audio/video information.
* You may also delete and deactivate your account with us at any time unless required not to do so by law or by a court order. If you do so, your profile will no longer be accessible by you. If you later choose to have an account with us, you will have to sign up for a new account as none of the information you previously provided or saved within your account will have been saved.
* Where we provide you personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on Youporn, so that we can offer a more relevant, tailored service. For instance, we could use your favourites' list to provide you with personalised content recommendations or ads. If you don’t want to receive these services, you can switch off the recommendations toggle on the “recommended” page or via the bar at the left of our page. For more information on how we use recommendations, please click [here](https://www.youporn.com/information/#systemguidelines).

9\. California Rights and Choices

As of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides California residents (“Consumer(s)”) certain rights with respect to their personal information, as this term is defined under the CCPA. In addition to the rights that we state under this Privacy Notice, and subject to the exceptions found under the CCPA, Consumers have the right to:

* Opt-out of the sale of their personal information, should we sell their personal information;
* Be informed of certain information concerning our collection and use of their personal information;
* Request that we delete certain personal information we collected from them;
* Appoint an agent to exercise their rights provided for by the CCPA, provided that a duly executed notarized power of attorney is presented and provided that the agent has information deemed sufficient to allow us to verify the identity of the Consumer in question and to locate his/her information in our systems;
* Not be subjected to discrimination for the exercise of these rights. We will not deny California residents the use of our service, neither will we provide a different level or quality or services for exercising any of their CCPA rights, unless as permitted under the CCPA.

Youporn does not sell, nor has it sold in the past twelve (12) months personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We may however disclose certain personal information with third parties, service providers and entities within our corporate group to enable them to perform certain services on our behalf and namely to make Youporn work properly, as described in the section above titled _Disclosure of Your Personal Information_.

Regardless, we respect the California residents’ right to exclude personal information from such sharing arrangements and to thereby opt-out of any future sale of their personal information. If the CCPA is applicable to you and you would like to exercise your rights, please use the buttons at the bottom of this page or email us at [support@youporn.com](mailto:support@youporn.com) with the email subject line “CCPA Request.”

In either case you will need to provide the following information to verify your identity and enable us to locate your information in our systems: your username and email address that you used to create an account with us, as well as any other information which we may reasonably request for us to verify your identity. We may require you verify that you have access to your account and/or email account that you used to register with us.

You can designate an agent to make a request by executing a notarized power of attorney to have that person act on your behalf and providing that person with the information listed above that allows us to verify your identity and locate your information. Alternatively, you will need to directly confirm your identity with us using the methods described above, sign an authorization for the agent to act on your behalf and provide us with confirmation that you have done so.

11\. Biometric Information

We employ third-party service providers to verify your identity, age, and the authenticity of the identification documents you provide using facial recognition technology. Facial recognition technology creates a mathematical representation of your facial features from the live scan of your face, your selfie, and the government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us. Information derived from this mathematical representation, which may be considered biometric information under the laws of certain states and countries, is shared by our service providers with us as further described below.

Your biometric information will be processed to:

* verify you are a real, live person and to prevent the use of methods which would allow a user to identify as someone else;
* to match your selfie with your government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us to make sure that nobody is impersonating you;
* to help confirm your age;

Please note that this section entitled _"Biometric Information"_ applies to relevant users who wish to upload content onto Youporn but does not apply to identifiers processed by our third-party age verification service providers solely for the purpose of granting you access to Youporn. Our third-party service providers will store your biometric information according to their retention policies, please consult the section _"Retention of Personal Information"_ below to understand our retention practices.

13\. Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries

By using Youporn you consent to the transfer of information that we process about you, which may include personal information to other countries in which members of our corporate group or our service providers are located. When we transfer personal information to countries outside of the EEA or other regions or countries with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with the applicable laws. Where applicable, we rely on decisions of the European Commission, known as “adequacy decisions”, recognizing that certain countries offer a level of protection of personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA. In other situations, we rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (and the equivalent standard contractual clauses for the UK, where appropriate) or on derogations provided for under the applicable law to transfer information to a third country.

For more information or to obtain a copy of our standard contractual clauses, please see the section “_Contact Information_” below on how to contact us.

14\. Retention of Personal Information

We will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active, or for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we processed it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider several factors, including what personal data we are processing, the risk of harm from any unauthorised disclosure, why we are processing your personal data and whether we can achieve this outcome by another means without having to process it.

Where we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, we will delete your personal information from our systems.

For more information on data retention periods, please contact us by using the information in the Section _"Contact Information"_ below.

Where permissible, we will also delete your personal information upon your request as explained in the section _"Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information"_.

COPYRIGHT POLICY
================

Last Modified: August 17, 2023

Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement

We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the **“DMCA”**) or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws. Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user’s access to [Youporn.com](https://www.youporn.com/) (“**Youporn**”), or all of the foregoing.

If you believe any material accessible on Youporn infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, “Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement” for instructions on filing such a notice). These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, “Counter-Notification Procedures” for instructions on filing a counter notification). It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.

All copyright infringement notifications and counter-notifications must be written in English. Any attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters may, at our discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded.

Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement

If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process. Do not make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.

You may notify Youporn of alleged copyright infringement via our form found at [/information/#dmcaForm](https://www.youporn.com/information/#dmcaForm). This form is designed to help you identify your content accurately and help speed up the process of content take-down.

In accordance with the DMCA, the written notice (the **“DMCA Notice”**) must include substantially the following:

* Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works, a representative list of such works.
* Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material. If your complaint does not contain the specific URL of the video you believe infringes your rights, we may be unable to locate and remove it. General information about the video, such as a channel URL or username, is typically not adequate. Please include the URL(s) of the exact video(s).
* Adequate information by which we, and the uploader(s) of any video(s) you remove, can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.
* A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
* Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf. To satisfy this requirement, you may type your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.

Our designated Copyright Agent to receive DMCA Notices is:

Lawrence G. Walters  
**Walters Law Group**  
195 W. Pine Ave.  
Longwood, FL 32750  
Email: copyright@aylofreesites.com  

Please do not send other inquiries or requests to our designated copyright agent. Absent prior express permission, our designated copyright agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to receive valid DMCA Notices or Counter-Notices (as defined below) is expressly disclaimed.

If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Youporn is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

The copyright owner’s name will be published on Youporn in place of disabled content. This will become part of the public record of your DMCA Notice, along with your description of the work(s) allegedly infringed. All the information provided in a DMCA Notice, the actual DMCA Notice (including your personal information), or both may be forwarded to the uploader of the allegedly infringing content. By submitting a DMCA Notice, you consent to having your information revealed in this way.

Counter-Notification Procedures

If you have received a DMCA Notice and believe that material you posted on Youporn was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (a “Counter-Notice”). Counter notifications must be submitted by the video’s original uploader or an agent authorized to act on their behalf.

Counter-notices must be sent to our designated agent:

Lawrence G. Walters  
**Walters Law Group**  
195 W. Pine Ave.  
Longwood, FL 32750  
Email: copyright@aylofreesites.com  

Please do not send other inquiries or requests to our designated copyright agent. Absent prior express permission, our designated copyright agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to receive valid DMCA Notices or Counter-Notices is expressly disclaimed.

Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:

* Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature;
* Identification of the allegedly infringing content and its location before removal or access to it was disabled;
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification; and
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial district in which the operator of Youporn may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided us with the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.

We will not respond to Counter-Notices that do not meet the requirements set out above.

After we receive your Counter Notice, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original DMCA Notice and inform that party that the removed material may be restored after ten (10) business days but no later than fourteen (14) business days from the date we received your Counter Notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party who filed the original DMCA Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.

Please note that when we forward your Counter Notice, it will include your personal information. By submitting a counter notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter notification to any party other than the original claimant or to law enforcement or parties that assist us with enforcing and protecting our rights.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Youporn was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

Recommendations and tailoring content to you at Youporn
=======================================================

Who and what our recommendations are for and why we do it

At Youporn, your user experience is important to us.

Given the nature of our services, this means we want to get tailored content, like videos, photos, and GIFs, to you while respecting your privacy, safety, and the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. To do this, we’ve developed methods that give you what you want while keeping you safe and within the legal parameters of where you live. If you want safety and privacy specifics, check out our [Terms of Service](https://www.youporn.com/information/#terms), [Trust & Safety](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/4419836212499) policy, [Privacy Notice](https://www.youporn.com/information/#privacy), and [EU DSA](https://www.youporn.com/information/#eudsa) pages.

Here’s a look at how we deliver a top-notch user experience to you:

How we recommend relevant content and ads

To deliver content and ads that suit your preferences, we offer different recommendation options for you to explore:

* **Hot, hottest, and featured videos**
    
    On our homepage and in the **Hottest** section, you can browse the hottest porn. These videos are featured by an algorithm for their high quality.
    
    To feature videos, we consider per country, the video’s views, ratings, comments, favorite markings, and total time watched.
    
    To sort these featured videos, we use the same factors as above, together with the time we featured the video. You can also sort chronologically by the time we featured the videos by selecting _Featured Recently_, where applicable.
    
    Hot, hottest, and featured videos may differ by country. On the **Hottest** page, you can switch countries in the _Country_ drop-down menu.
    
* **Recommended**
    
    We provide videos that could be interesting for you on a dedicated page.
    
    Our recommendations are based on metadata of the videos you watched, how you interacted with these videos, and popular videos in your region based on views, ratings, comments, favoriting, and total time watched.
    
    You can sort chronologically by most recent recommendations, as well as by relevance to you, which we determine based on the factors described above.
    
    If you prefer non-personalized recommendations, we offer these as hot videos on the help page, as described above.
    
* **Related content**
    
    On the video and GIF pages, we show related content. To determine the content you may find most relevant, we consider the metadata of the videos you watched, how you interacted with these videos, and popular videos in your region based on views, ratings, comments, favorite markings, and total time watched.
    
* **Random**
    
    Let us surprise you. We provide content that we selected randomly.
    
* **Trending searches**
    
    We display trending searches based on the frequency of recent searches by other users in the same country as you.
    
* **TrafficJunky ads**
    
    Where we deliver dynamic advertising, we use the following factors to identify advertisements that we believe may be most relevant to you:
    
    * Geographic location
    * Date and time
    * Context the ad is placed in
    * Demographics
    * Previous interactions with ads or content
    * Operating system
    * Browser settings (model, version, and language)
    * Internet connection, that is, IP range, internet service provider, connection type, and region.
    
    If you deactivate _Targeting/Advertising Cookies_, we do not use demographics or previous interactions with ads or content to find the most relevant advertising for you.
    
    _Targeting/Advertising Cookies_ can be switched off at any time by going to the footer of the website and choosing **Manage Cookies**.
    

How the sorting of content works

We want to make sure that you always see the content that you enjoy most. To enhance your user experience, we provide a variety of sorting options for you to choose from.

Where available, you can switch options in the upper right corner. Sorting can be based on how we recommend relevant content and on the following options, where applicable:

* **Homepage sorting:** Content on the homepage is sorted based on the collective behavior of users to show videos that were watched and enjoyed. We also account for if you liked or watched a video, and what’s the hottest and trending content. If you don't want recommendations based on your viewed content, you can turn _Personalized Recommendations_ off on the hamburger menu.
* **Most recent and newest:** Content is sorted by publication date.
* **Most viewed:** Content is sorted by number of views. Where applicable, you can customize the relevant time frame and country for the views.
* **Top rated:** Content is sorted by the number of likes and dislikes. Where applicable, you can customize the relevant time frame for the ratings.
* **Longest:** Videos are sorted by length.
* **A-Z or alphabetical:** Content is sorted by name or title.
* **Most subscribed:** Content is sorted by number of subscriptions.
* **Number of videos:** Content is sorted by number of attributable videos.
* **Most popular:**
    * **Categories and Channels:** Content is sorted by number of views. Where applicable, you can customize the relevant time frame and country for the views.
    * **Pornstars, Models, and Community:** To determine the most popular content creators, we consider views, the number of times the pornstar or model is searched, and subscriptions.
* **Top trending or trending:**
    * **Pornstars and Models:** To determine the top trending content creators, we consider the popularity of a creator’s content within a specific time period.
* **Most relevant:** Most relevant content is shown based on keyword search results, such as matching tags, model and pornstar names, titles of content, and categories to the search entry. We also show newer content first, specifically content with more engagement.

More options on how you can customize our recommendations

On the homepage for Youporn, select the **User** icon, and you can turn on or off _Personalized Recommendations_. If you turn off this feature, the videos you watched and how you interacted with these videos don’t influence any content recommendations we show you.
