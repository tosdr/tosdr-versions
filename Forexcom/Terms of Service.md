Currency Contracts with Customer. Each Bid Price or Ask Price shall be for a Spot Contract with a specified Value Date and shall specify each Eligible

Foreign Currency or Tradable U.S. Dollar-based Currency Pairs involved where applicable. FOREX.com expects that these prices will be reasonably

related to the bid prices and ask prices available in the market at that time for similar transactions, but a number of factors, such as communication

system delays, high volume or volatility can result in deviations between prices quoted by FOREX.com and other sources. FOREX.com makes no

warranty, express or implied, that Bid Prices and Ask Prices represent prevailing bid prices and ask prices. In addition, these Bid and/or Ask Prices may

reflect, at the direction of the Introducing Broker, additional pips added to the BID and/or ASK price that may result in an increase of the dealable spread

available for the Customer’s Account as well as a per trade or per lot commission and/or fees. See Section 11-Charges.



4.2. Order Execution. FOREX.com will attempt to execute all Orders that it may, in its sole discretion, accept from Customer in accordance with Customer’s

Desk. All Contracts made and entered into by FOREX.com hereunder will be entered into by FOREX.com as principal. Customer acknowledges,

understands and agrees that FOREX.com is not acting as a broker, intermediary, agent, and advisor or in any fiduciary capacity. Customer acknowledges,

understands and agrees that all Orders that FOREX.com, in its discretion, accepts are undertaken on a “best-efforts basis” in accordance with the

relevant provisions of the Trading Policies and Procedures, as amended from time to time. Please visit FOREX.com’s website for more information on

In rare circumstances due to market conditions, lack of liquidity typically associated with large Order sizes and/or higher than normal market volatility and

associated volume, your Order may be subject to manual review. Such manual review may result in a delay in execution with a potential for price slippage.

Large Orders in certain currency pairs are subject to additional bid/ask spread markup upon execution, in accordance with Schedule A – Oversized

Orders of this Agreement.



4.3. Trade Matching. FOREX.com or its affiliates may, at a future date, establish a trade matching system or determine to route Customer’s Orders to a

without limitation, over any trade matching network in use by FOREX.com customers and/or the general public.

Margin, Collateral, Contract or other property and FOREX.com is unable to deliver such Margin, Collateral, Contract or other property to a purchaser

In consideration of FOREX.com agreeing to enter into Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Foreign Exchange Contracts with the undersigned (hereinafter referred

to as the “Customer”), Customer acknowledges, understands and agrees that:



1. Trading Is Very Speculative and Risky. Foreign Exchange Trading is highly speculative and is suitable only for those customers who (a) understand

and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved, and (b) are financially able to assume losses significantly in excess of Margin or

deposits. Foreign Exchange Trading may not be an appropriate investment for retirement funds. Customer represents, warrants and agrees that

Customer understands these risks; that Customer is willing and able, financially and otherwise, to assume the risks of Foreign Exchange Trading; and

that loss of Customer’s entire Account Balance will not change Customer’s life style.



2. High Leverage And Low Margin Can Lead To Quick Losses. The high leverage and low Margin associated with Foreign Exchange Trading can result

in significant losses due to price changes in Foreign Exchange Contracts, Cross Currency Contracts. Customers must maintain the Minimum Margin

Requirement on their Open Positions at all times. It is the customer's responsibility to monitor his/her Account Balance. FOREX.com has the right to

liquidate any or all Open Positions whenever the Minimum Margin Requirement is not maintained. Increasing leverage increases risk.



3. Prices, Margin And Valuations Are Set By FOREX.com And May Be Different From Prices Reported Elsewhere. FOREX.com will provide prices

to be used in trading, valuation of Customer positions and determination of Margin requirements. Although FOREX.com expects that these prices will be

reasonably related to prices available to banks and other participants in what is known as the interbank market, prices reported by FOREX.com may vary

from prices available in the interbank market. FOREX.com will exercise considerable discretion in setting and collecting Margin. FOREX.com is authorized

to convert funds in Customer’s Account for Margin into and from such Foreign Currency at a rate of exchange determined by FOREX.com in its sole

discretion on the basis of then-prevailing money market rates.



4. One Click Trading And Immediate Execution. FOREX.com’s automated order entry system provides immediate transmission of Customer’s Order

once Customer enters the notional amount and clicks “Buy/Sell.” There is no “second look” before transmission, and Market Orders cannot be cancelled.

This feature may be different from other trading systems. Although not required, we recommend a Customer utilize the Demo Trading System to become

familiar with the order entry process before trading online with FOREX.com. Customer agrees that by using FOREX.com’s order-entry system, Customer

agrees to the one-click system and accepts the risk of this immediate transmission feature.



5. Telephone Orders And Immediate Execution. Market Orders executed through the FOREX.com Trading Desk are completed when FOREX.com says

“deal” or “done.” At that point Customer has bought or sold and cannot cancel the Market Order. By placing Market Orders through the FOREX.com

Trading Desk, Customer agrees to such immediate execution and accepts the risk of this immediate execution feature.



6. Market Analysis Content and Tools are Informational, Customer Makes Independent Decisions, and FOREX.com is not an Adviser or a

Fiduciary to Customer. Any and all market analysis tools or content provided by FOREX.com do not constitute an offer to buy or sell, or the solicitation

of an offer to buy or sell, any Foreign Exchange contracts, cross currency contracts. Each decision by Customer to enter into a Contract or other

transaction with FOREX.com and each decision whether a Contract or other transaction is appropriate or proper for Customer is an independent decision

by Customer. FOREX.com is not acting as an advisor or serving as a fiduciary to Customer. Customer agrees that FOREX.com has no fiduciary duty to

Customer and no liability in connection with and is not responsible for any liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees,

incurred in connection with Customer following FOREX.com’s market analysis or taking or not taking any action based upon any information provided by

FOREX.com.



7. Market Analysis Content is Based on Personal Judgments and is not Guaranteed. The market analysis content of FOREX.com is based solely on

the judgment of FOREX.com’s personnel. This content may or may not be consistent with the market positions or intentions of FOREX.com, its affiliates

and employees. The market analysis content of FOREX.com is based upon information believed to be reliable, but FOREX.com cannot and does not

guarantee the accuracy or completeness thereof or represent that following such analysis will reduce or eliminate the risk inherent in Foreign Exchange

trading.



8. There is no Central Market or Clearinghouse Guarantee of Payment. Each Contract is a contract directly between FOREX.com and the Customer.

There is no clearinghouse and no guarantee by any other party of FOREX.com’s payment obligations to Customer. Customer must look only to

FOREX.com for performance on all Contracts in Customer’s Account and for return of any Margin or Collateral.



9. No Guarantees Of Profit. There are no guarantees of profit or freedom from loss in Foreign Exchange Trading. Customer has received no such

guarantees from FOREX.com or from any of its representatives. Customer is aware of the risks inherent in Foreign Exchange Trading and is financially

able to bear such risks and withstand any losses incurred.



10. Customer May Not Be Able To Close open positions. Due to market conditions or other circumstances FOREX.com may be unable to close out

Customer’s position at the level specified by Customer, and Customer agrees FOREX.com will bear no liability for failure to do so.



11. Trading Ahead And Along. FOREX.com its personnel and affiliates and various other parties may execute orders at the same or better prices ahead

of a Customer Order.



12. Third Party Agents. In the event that Customer grants trading authority or control over Customer’s Account to a third party (the “Trading Agent”), whether

on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, FOREX.com shall in no way be responsible for reviewing Customer’s choice of such Trading Agent or for

making any recommendations with respect thereto. FOREX.com makes no representations or warranties concerning any Trading Agent; FOREX.com

shall not be responsible for any loss to Customer occasioned by the actions of the Trading Agent; and FOREX.com does not, by implication or otherwise,

endorse or approve of the operating methods of the Trading Agent. If Customer gives the Trading Agent authority to exercise any of its rights over its

Account, Customer does so at Customer’s risk. Even though the undersigned grants authority to Trading Agent, client should be diligent and closely

scrutinize all Account activity.



13. Internet Trading. Trading via the internet carries with it risks of computer system or network failure. Customer understands that FOREX.com shall not

be liable for any claims, losses, damages, costs or expenses, including attorneys’ fees, caused, directly or indirectly, by any breakdown or failure of any

transmission or communication system or computer facility or trading software, whether belonging to FOREX.com, Customer, any market, 3rd party

vendor, or any settlement or clearing system when Customer trades online (via Internet).



14. Telephone Orders. FOREX.com is not responsible for disruption, failure or malfunction of telephone lines.

15. Quoting Errors. Should a quoting error occur for any reason, FOREX.com is not liable for any resulting errors in Account balances and/or open

position(s) and reserves the right to make necessary corrections or adjustments on the Account involved to the full extent permitted by applicable laws

or regulations.



16. Creditor Priority in Bankruptcy. The transactions you are entering into with FOREX.com are not traded on an exchange. Therefore, under the U.S.

Bankruptcy Code, your funds may not receive the same protections as funds used to margin or guarantee exchange-traded futures and options contracts,

which receive a priority in bankruptcy. Since that same priority has not been given to funds used for off-exchange forex trading, if FOREX.com becomes

insolvent and you have a claim for amounts deposited or profits earned on transactions with FOREX.com, your claim may not receive a priority. Without

a priority, you are a general creditor and your claim will be paid, along with the claims of other general creditors, from any monies still available after

priority claims are paid. Even customer funds that Company keeps separate from its own operating funds may not be safe from the claims of other

general and priority creditors.

to carefully read these Trading Policies and Procedures and to inform FOREX.com of any questions or objections that you may have regarding them

before entering each and every trading Order. In entering your trading Orders with FOREX.com, you agree, represent, warrant and certify that you

understand and accept these Trading Policies and Procedures, as they are set forth here and as may be amended from time to time by FOREX.com, in

its sole discretion, as posted to FOREX.com’s website, and you agree to comply with these Trading Policies and Procedures as in effect at any time.

Terms capitalized in these Trading Policies and Procedures shall have the meanings set out in Section 1 of the Customer Agreement.



2. TRADING HOURS. All references to FOREX.com hours of trading are in U.S. Eastern Time (“ET”) using a 24-hour format. FOREX.com normally provides

access for foreign exchange trading on the website from 17:00 ET on Sunday to 17:00 ET on Friday, but FOREX.com reserves the right to suspend or

modify its trading hours at any time and in such an event will inform clients in advance on a best efforts basis of any changes in its operating hours.

Trading hours by contract type may vary. OTC Foreign Currency typically operate 24 hours a day. Following submission of an Order to trade, it is the

sole responsibility of Customer to remain available for Order and Fill confirmations, and other communications regarding Customer’s FOREX.com

the Account.



3. TRADE ORDERS



3.1. Order Types and Order Entry. For information regarding the types of Orders accepted by FOREX.com, please refer to FOREX.com’s website. All

Orders must be placed through the FOREX.com online trading platforms or by telephone to the FOREX.com trading desk. Telephone Orders are accepted

in the sole discretion of FOREX.com.

3.2. Execution of Market Orders.



3.2.1. Immediate Execution of Market Orders Through the FOREX.com Trading Desk. Market Orders executed over the telephone with the FOREX.com

Trading Desk are completed when the FOREX.com representative verbally confirms that the Order has been placed. At that point Customer has bought

or sold and cannot cancel the Market Order. Customer agrees by placing Market Orders through the FOREX.com Trading Desk to such immediate

execution and accepts the risk of this immediate execution feature.



3.2.2. Order Cancellation. Non-market Orders may be cancelled via the FOREX.com Online Trading System. Rapid changes in Bid Prices and Ask Prices,

however, may cause Customer’s Order to be executed before Customer can cancel it and FOREX.com shall have no liability for any claims, losses,

damages, costs or expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising directly or indirectly out of the failure of such Order to be cancelled. Customer may contact

FOREX.com by telephone if facing difficulty with Order cancellation.



3.3. Terms of Acceptance for Orders. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to clearly indicate the terms of an Order when entered, regardless of Order type,

including but not limited to the Order’s Value Date and specified Spot Price limits, where applicable. Although a Spot Price is specified upon entry of

certain types of Orders, including stop/loss Orders, limit Orders, and other non-market Orders, market conditions may often prevent the execution of an

individual Customer’s Orders despite other dealing activity at that price level, or may often require Orders to be filled at a substantially different Spot

Price, and Customer agrees to accept the best price at which FOREX.com, in its discretion, may execute the Order. Customer acknowledges that

FOREX.com shall accept all Orders only on a best-efforts basis. FOREX.com shall have no liability for failure to execute Orders, and makes no guarantee

of an Order’s priority over the Orders of FOREX.com, its other customers, associated principals, officers, directors, affiliates, associates, employees,

banks, bank employees or other dealers. To the extent permitted by applicable laws or regulations, FOREX.com shall have the right, but not the obligation,

to reject any Order in whole or in part before or after confirmation, or to cancel and rescind any Fill, where Customer’s Account contains Margin that is

insufficient to support the entire Order at the time that market levels reach the Order levels as specified by the client, or where, in the opinion and sole

discretion of FOREX.com, the execution of such Order may place Customer’s Account in an insufficient Margin condition, or where such Order or Fill is

illegal or represents a breach of any warranty, representation, or obligation of the Customer. Customer agrees that certain large Orders will be subject

to additional bid/ask spread markup in accordance with Schedule A of this Agreement.



3.4. Confirmation of Fills. Trades executed online will be confirmed online within the trading platform. Telephone Orders are verbally confirmed and

confirmed online within the trading platform. Reports of the confirmation of Orders and statements of Accounts for Customer shall be deemed correct

and shall be conclusive and binding upon Customer immediately with respect to Orders confirmed via the FOREX.com trading platform. Customer may

object to confirmations and statements by telephone within two (2) Business Days of Order confirmation. Failure to object shall be deemed ratification by

Customer of all actions taken by FOREX.com or FOREX.com’s agents prior to Customer’s receipt of such reports. Customer’s failure to receive a trade

confirmation shall not relieve Customer of the obligation to object as set out herein. Customer agrees to immediately call to FOREX.com’s attention any

oral information that Customer has reason to believe is inconsistent with Customer’s own information. Customer understands, acknowledges and agrees

that errors, whether resulting in a profit or loss to Customer, shall be corrected to the full extent permitted by applicable laws or regulations, and if so

permitted, Customer’s Account will be credited or debited in such manner and extent as to place Customer’s Account in the same position in which it

would have been had the error not occurred.



Transaction Data Reports that include the transaction data required by NFA Compliance Rule 2-36 are available upon request. Please call 1-877-367-

1. FOREX.com may from time to time offer market news, commentary, charting, and analysis, trading performance analytics, signals-based products or

services and other trading support tools (“Trading Tools”). Before using any Trading Tools please read this note carefully. It complements the Customer

Agreement and associated risk disclosures furnished by us and should be read in conjunction with them. Unless stated otherwise, any capitalized terms

used below shall carry the same meanings as in the Customer Agreement.



2. The Trading Tools are general in nature and do not and will not take into account your personal objectives, financial situation, or needs. Before

acting on a Trading Tool, you should consider its appropriateness, having regard to your personal objectives, financial situation, and needs.



3. FOREX.com will not give advice to you on the merits of any trade and shall deal with you on an execution-only basis. None of our staff are authorized

by us or permitted under applicable laws to give you personal advice. Accordingly, you should not regard any proposed trades, trading

signals, suggested trading strategies, or other written or oral communications from us as investment recommendations or personal advice

or as expressing our view as to whether a particular trade is suitable for you or meets your financial objectives. You must rely on your own

judgement for any investment decision you make in relation to your Account. You have the final decision in relation to every trade you enter

into. You should make every effort to ensure you understand the Trading Tools and FOREX.com is entitled to assume that you do. If you

require investment or tax advice, please contact an independent investment or tax advisor.



4. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No warranty or representation is made that any

Account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in connection with any Trading Tool. In fact, there are frequently sharp

differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved. Actual returns may be different to any hypothetical

or indicative returns shown in any Trading Tool.



5. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading

does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example,

the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading platform in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect

actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which

cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.



6. FOREX.com does not undertake to continue to offer the Trading Tools at all times and may not offer the same in the future. FOREX.com may withdraw

or cancel any or all of the Trading Tools, or terminate your access to any or all of them, for any reason or for no reason at any time with or without notice,

in our sole discretion.



7. Trading Tools can only be used for your own personal benefit. They cannot be used for business purposes or on behalf of another person nor can they

be varied, passed on or resold to or shared with (in whole or in part) another person or entity or used to place any trades outside of our platform.



8. You will not copy, modify, de-compile, reverse engineer, or make derivative works of or from the Trading Tools or the manner in which they operate.



9. All intellectual property and other rights in the Trading Tools remain our sole property or the property of our licensors. FOREX.com does not assign,

license, or otherwise transfer to you any right or interest in the Trading Tools whatsoever, except for the right to access and use the Trading Tools as

expressly permitted by us in writing. In particular, but without limitation, all goodwill derived from the use or development of the Trading Tools will accrue

exclusively to us. You will not do, or omit to do, or permit to be done, any act that will or may materially weaken, damage or be detrimental to the Trading

Tools or the reputation of the goodwill associated with us or the Trading Tools.



10. FOREX.com does not commit to, and is not obliged to provide you with, any number of Trading Tools and the delivery of Trading Tools is not guaranteed.

FOREX.com may provide the Trading Tools at such times, at such intervals and based on such factors as we may determine in our absolute discretion.

You should not therefore use or rely on the Trading Tools as a method of monitoring prices, positions/markets or making trading decisions, and no liability

will be accepted by us in this respect.



11. The Trading Tools are provided "AS IS", without any representation or warranty of any kind whatsoever, including that they will be without interruption or

error free.



12. FOREX.com may suspend use of the Trading Tools at any time to carry out maintenance, repairs, upgrades or any development related issues, in order

to comply with Applicable Laws or for any other reason determined by us in our sole discretion.



13. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree not to hold FOREX.com, our directors, officers, employees, or agents liable for losses or damages,

including legal fees, that may arise, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from: (a) non-delivery, delayed delivery, or the misdirected delivery of any

Trading Tool, (b) inaccurate or incomplete content of any Trading Tool, or (c) your reliance on or use of the information in any Trading Tool for any

purpose.



Any failure by you to comply with any of the above obligations or restrictions shall constitute an event of default under our Customer Agreement.

CFTC RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT



OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE THE LEVERAGED TRADING OF CONTRACTS DENOMINATED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONDUCTED WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR A RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER AS YOUR

COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OF THE LEVERAGE AND THE OTHER RISKS DISCLOSED HERE, YOU CAN RAPIDLY LOSE ALL OF THE FUNDS

YOU DEPOSIT FOR SUCH TRADING AND YOU MAY LOSE MORE THAN YOU DEPOSIT.



YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING POINTS BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER SUCH

TRADING IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.



(1) TRADING IS NOT ON A REGULATED MARKET OR EXCHANGE—YOUR DEALER IS YOUR TRADING PARTNER WHICH IS A

DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BEFORE YOU ENGAGE IN ANY RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING, YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THE

REGISTRATION STATUS OF YOUR COUNTERPARTY.



The off-exchange foreign currency trading you are entering into is not conducted on an interbank market, nor is it conducted on a futures

exchange subject to regulation as a designated contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The foreign currency trades you transact

are trades with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer as your counterparty. WHEN YOU SELL, THE DEALER IS THE

BUYER. WHEN YOU BUY, THE DEALER IS THE SELLER. As a result, when you

lose money trading, your dealer is making money on such trades, in addition to any fees, commissions, or spreads the dealer may charge.



(2) AN ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM FOR RETAIL FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS IS NOT AN EXCHANGE. IT

IS AN ELECTRONIC CONNECTION FOR ACCESSING YOUR DEALER. THE TERMS OF AVAILABILITY OF SUCH A PLATFORM ARE GOVERNED

ONLY BY YOUR CONTRACT WITH YOUR DEALER.



Any trading platform that you may use to enter off-exchange foreign currency transactions is only connected to your futures commission

merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. You are accessing that trading platform only to transact with your dealer. You are not trading with any other

entities or customers of the dealer by accessing such platform. The availability and operation of any such platform, including the consequences of the

unavailability of the trading platform for any reason, is governed only by the terms of your account agreement with the dealer.



(3) YOUR DEPOSITS WITH THE DEALER HAVE NO REGULATORY PROTECTIONS.



All of your rights associated with your retail forex trading, including the manner and denomination of any payments made to you, are governed

by the contract terms established in your account agreement with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. Funds deposited

by you with a futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer for trading off-exchange foreign currency transactions are not subject to the

customer funds protections provided to customers trading on a contract market that is designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Your

dealer may commingle your funds with its own operating funds or use them for other purposes. In the event your dealer becomes bankrupt, any funds

the dealer is holding for you in addition to any amounts owed to you resulting from trading, whether or not any assets are maintained in separate deposit

accounts by the dealer, may be treated as an unsecured creditor’s claim.



(4) YOU ARE LIMITED TO YOUR DEALER TO OFFSET OR LIQUIDATE ANY TRADING POSITIONS SINCE THE TRANSACTIONS

ARE NOT MADE ON AN EXCHANGE OR MARKET, AND YOUR DEALER MAY SET ITS OWN PRICES.



Your ability to close your transactions or offset positions is limited to what your dealer will offer to you, as there is no other market for these

transactions. Your dealer may offer any prices it wishes, and it may offer prices derived from outside sources or not in its discretion. Your dealer may

establish its prices by offering spreads from third party prices, but it is under no obligation to do so or to continue to do so.

Your dealer may offer different prices to different customers at any point in time on its own terms. The terms of your account agreement

alone govern the obligations your dealer has to you to offer prices and offer offset or liquidating transactions in your account and make any payments to

you. The prices offered by your dealer may or may not reflect prices available elsewhere at any exchange, interbank, or other market for foreign currency.



(5) PAID SOLICITORS MAY HAVE UNDISCLOSED CONFLICTS.



The futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer may compensate introducing brokers for introducing your account in ways

which are not disclosed to you. Such paid solicitors are not required to have, and may not have, any special expertise in trading, and may have conflicts

of interest based on the method by which they are compensated. Solicitors working on behalf of futures commission merchants and retail foreign

exchange dealers are required to register. You should confirm that they are, in fact registered. You should thoroughly investigate the manner in which all

such solicitors are compensated and be very cautious in granting any person or entity authority to trade on your behalf. You should always consider

obtaining dated written confirmation of any information you are relying on from your dealer or a solicitor in making any trading or account decisions.



FINALLY, YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ANY STATEMENTS BY ANY DEALERS OR SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHICH

MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF, OR CONTRADICT, ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS RISK DISCLOSURE. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY INDICATE

POTENTIAL SALES FRAUD.



THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF TRADING OFF-EXCHANGE

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER.



I hereby acknowledge that I have received and understood this risk disclosure statement.

Trading is very speculative and risky. Foreign Exchange Trading is highly speculative and is suitable only for those customers who (a) understand and

are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved, and (b) are financially able to assume losses significantly in excess of margin or

deposits. Customer represents, warrants and agrees that Customer understands these risks; that Customer is willing and able, financially and otherwise,

to assume the risks of Foreign Exchange Trading and that loss of Customer’s entire Account Balance will not change Customer’s life style.



The high leverage and low margin associated with Foreign Exchange Trading can result in significant losses due to price changes in Foreign Exchange

Contracts, Cross Currency Contracts.. Company’s margin policies may require that additional funds be provided to properly margin Customer’s Account

and that Customer must immediately meet such margin requirements. Failure to maintain the Minimum Margin Requirement may result in the liquidation

of any open positions with resultant loss to Customer.



FOREX IS AN OVER THE COUNTER (OTC) MARKET, MEANING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING YOU ARE ENTERING INTO IS NOT

CONDUCTED ON AN EXCHANGE. AS A MARKET MAKER, FOREX.COM IS THE COUNTERPARTY IN THESE TRANSACTIONS AND,

THEREFORE, ACTS AS THE BUYER WHEN YOU SELL AND THE SELLER WHEN YOU BUY. AS A RESULT,

FOREX.COM’S INTERESTS MAY BE IN CONFLICT WITH YOURS. UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN YOUR WRITTEN AGREEMENT

OR OTHER WRITTEN DOCUMENTS FOREX.COM ESTABLISHES THE PRICES AND WHICH IT OFFERS TO TRADE WITH YOU. THE PRICES

OFFERED MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST PRICES AVAILABLE AND DIFFERENT PRICES MAY BE OFFERED TO DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS.



IF FOREX.COM ELECTS NOT TO COVER ITS OWN TRADING EXPOSURE, THEN YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT FOREX.COM MAY MAKE

MORE MONEY IF THE MARKET GOES AGAINST YOU. ADDITIONALLY, SINCE FOREX.COM ACTS AS THE BUYER OR SELLER IN THE

TRANSACTION, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY EVALUATE ANY TRADE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU RECEIVE FROM FOREX.COM OR ANY OF ITS

SOLICITORS.
