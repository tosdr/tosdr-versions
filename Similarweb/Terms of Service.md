PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS AND ACCESSING, USING AND/OR REGISTERING FOR THE SIMILARWEB WEBSITE, PLATFORM OR SERVICES.

By creating an Account in Similarweb as an Authorized User and/or by accessing and using the Similarweb Platform or website, [www.Similarweb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/) (the “**Site**”), you accept these Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”), and you acknowledge that you, on your own behalf as an individual and/or on behalf of your employer or another legal entity (collectively, “**you**” or “**your**”), have read and understood and agree to comply with these Terms, and are entering into a binding legal agreement with Similarweb Ltd. and/or, where applicable, one of its group companies or affiliates (“**Similarweb**”, “**us**”, “**we**” or “**our**”).  If you are creating an Account, you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your team, company, organization or any other entity that you either represent or belong to (the “**Organization**”), and you represent and warrant that you have full authority to bind your Organization to these Terms.  If you do not agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms or do not have authority to bind your Organization, please do not accept these Terms or access or use the Platform. To the extent allowed under applicable law, you hereby waive any applicable rights to require or receive an original (non-electronic) signature or delivery of non-electronic records of these Terms.  If you have executed a written contract, service order or other agreement with Similarweb governing your access to and use of the Platform, then the terms of such agreement will govern and will supersede these Terms in the event of any conflict or inconsistency; except for the terms herein that refer to your access to, use of and/or registration for the Site or the terms that refer to creating an Account (as such term is defined herein) for your use of and/or access to our Platform in accordance with Section 7 herein, all of which shall remain in effect.  All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given for such terms herein.

1. **Description of the Service and Site.  
    **1.1.      Service. Similarweb is the owner or licensee of the Similarweb platform, a market intelligence solution that enables insights on estimated traffic and usage data for websites and mobile apps which is made available to you on a software as a service (SaaS) basis (the “**Platform**”) through a web portal on our Site, and includes: (i) the software that you access via the Site; (ii) any other applications, extensions and features, if any, made available or provided to you by Similarweb in connection with the Site or Platform (the “**Applications**”); and (iii) the trademarks and logos (“**Marks**”), content, text, documents, descriptions, products, graphics, photos, sounds, videos, and interactive features (together with the Marks, “**Content**”), contained in or made available through the Site or Platform.1.2.      Site. The Site [www.similarweb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/) is intended to provide you with information about Similarweb and its products, to enable you to purchase a subscription to the Platform and provide subscribers with a web portal to access the Platform and/or download the Applications, if any.

2. **Ability to Accept Terms**.  If you, as an Authorized User, access and use the Site and/or Platform, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old (or 13 years old if you are registering with the supervision of an adult parent or guardian). The Site and/or Platform is only intended for individuals aged eighteen years or older, or thirteen (13) years or older with the supervision of an adult parent or guardian.  If you are under 13 years old please do not visit, access or use the Site and/or Platform.  If you are between 13 and 18 years of age, then you must review these Terms with your parent or guardian before visiting, accessing or using the Site to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand these Terms and agree to them. You may not access and use the Platform if you are, and you represent and warrant that you are not, a competitor of Similarweb.

3. **Subscription to the Platform.  
    **Subject to your compliance with these Terms as an Authorized User, Similarweb hereby grants you a non-exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, revocable and limited license to use a limited version of the Platform with the features described on the Site (“**Subscription**”) to access and use the Platform during the Subscription Period (as defined below). An “**Authorized User**” means an employee or representative of your Organization who has been supplied with a single user identification and password to access and use the Platform on his/her own behalf or on behalf of his/her Organization. Your use of the Platform shall be permitted only by employees of your Organization by submitting a request to [support@similarweb.com](mailto:support@similarweb.com)indicating the names, business email addresses, primary locations and related registration information that may be requested of the personnel intended as the Authorized Users. No other use of the Platform not specified in these Terms, including use by any other employees, agents, contractors, consultants, representatives, personnel or other parties or individuals of or on behalf of your Organization or its affiliates or subsidiaries, shall be permitted. Similarweb shall provide you, for each Authorized User, a user name and password for logging into the Platform, following which use of the Platform by each Authorized User shall be enabled. You shall have the right to reassign any of the Authorized Users provided hereunder, from one of the individuals currently specified as an Authorized User to any other employee of your Organization, by submitting a request to [support@Similarweb.com](mailto:support@similarweb.com) indicating the name, business email address, and primary location of the person intended as the new Authorized User, provided that: (a) such reassignment and change shall not become effective unless Similarweb provides its consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (b) you may not reassign any Authorized User more than a total of two (2) times in the aggregate during the Initial Term or any renewal Term of your Subscription.

4. **Site Access.** We hereby grant you permission to visit and use the Site for your information and personal use only (and, where applicable, the internal business purposes of your Organization), subject to these Terms and your compliance with applicable law.

5. **License to Applications**. To the extent that you wish to download and install the Applications, if any, you acknowledge and agree that we grant you a non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use the Applications solely for your personal use (and, where applicable, the internal business purposes of your Organization). We may modify the Applications from time to time, and you hereby agree that we may automatically install such modifications without first asking for your approval. We are not obligated to support the Applications, and may at any time suspend or terminate your license and disable the Applications downloaded and/or installed by you. You may not make unauthorized modifications, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of the Applications.

6. **Restrictions.** Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you may not, and shall not allow any third party to: (i) give, sell, rent, lease, timeshare, sublicense, disclose, publish, assign, market, sell, display, transmit, broadcast, transfer or distribute any portion of the Platform, Site or Applications to any third party; (ii) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Platform, Site or Applications or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or that enforce limitations on use of the Platform, Site or Applications; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, decrypt or, attempt to derive the source code of, the Platform, Site or Applications or any components thereof, or create any derivative works of the Platform, Site or Applications, or any part thereof; (iv) present or share the data or information received through the Platform without Similarweb’s prior consent, and in the event such consent was given, present or share such data or information without attribution to Similarweb pursuant to Similarweb’s branding guidelines; (v) use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access or monitor the Platform, Site or Applications for any purpose, or to copy, access, collect, download, or otherwise obtain data, content or other information from the Platform, Site or Applications; (vi) take any action that imposes or which Similarweb determines, in its sole discretion, may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the Similarweb infrastructure or infrastructure which supports the Platform, Site or Applications; (vii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the integrity or proper working of the Platform, Site or Applications, or any related activities; (viii) remove, deface, obscure, or alter Similarweb’s or any third party’s identification, attribution or copyright notices, trademarks, or other proprietary rights affixed to or provided as part of the Platform, Site or Applications, or use or display logos of the Platform, Site or Applications without Similarweb’s prior written approval; (ix) use Similarweb’s Marks without our prior written consent; (x) use the Platform, Site or Applications to develop, offer, operate, support or enable a competing service or product; and/or (xi) use the Platform, Site or Applications in any unlawful manner, for any harmful, irresponsible, or inappropriate purpose (including without limitation third-party defamation), or in breach of these Terms, any terms and conditions of any third-party product or service you use, or any agreement you have entered into with any third party.

You always have the right to terminate our access to that information about some or all of your Organization’s sites or apps, by following the instructions provided by the relevant platform.

If, during or following the expiration of a Trial Subscription, you choose to purchase a Subscription for a longer period as may be offered by us, the term of your Subscription shall commence upon our confirmation of your payment of the Fees in accordance with the payment instructions on the Site, at which time you will be provided access to the Platform with the same features, and the term of your Subscription shall continue on a month-to-month basis (or other basis as may be specified in our offer from time to time) until canceled by either party on fourteen (14) days written notice, or as otherwise terminated or suspended in accordance with these Terms.12.2.    Annual Subscription Term. If, during or following the expiration of a Trial Subscription, you choose to purchase an annual Subscription, the term of your Subscription shall commence upon our confirmation of your payment of the Fees in accordance with the payment instructions on the Site, at which time you will be provided access to the Platform with the same features, and the term of your Subscription shall continue for a period of twelve (12) months (the **“Initial Term”**). Thereafter, your Subscription shall be extended for one or more additional periods of twelve (12) months each, unless either party notifies the other party thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term that it does not wish to renew the Subscription. Each 12-month Initial Term and renewal term is referred to herein as a “**Term**”.
    
    12.3.    Termination by Similarweb. Similarweb may terminate your Subscription to the Platform and/or Applications at any time and without prior written notice in any case where it believes that you or your Organization have breached these Terms.

    12.4.    Termination by you. You may terminate your Subscription to the Platform by canceling your Account through the tools that we make available within the Platform or by sending a cancellation request to us at [support@similarweb.com](mailto:support@similarweb.com), in which case we will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond within a reasonable time. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and Fees paid are non-refundable.

    12.6.    Effect of Termination of Platform.  Upon termination of your Subscription to the Platform, your Account and your Organization’s Account and all licenses granted by Similarweb to you and your Organization under these Terms with respect to the Platform shall be terminated and you and your Organization will lose all access to the Platform or Applications.
