The AA Limited and our Data Protection Officer (DPO)
----------------------------------------------------

We are the AA. Our main address is Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 4EA. The data controller of our website and app is Automobile Association Developments Limited unless a different entity is listed. For certain products and services, there may be an additional or a different data controller. If so, the data controller will be listed in the product privacy notice or in the terms and conditions of the product or service. We have a Data Protection Officer who you can contact by using the contact details at the bottom of this notice.

Personal data we hold and use
-----------------------------

We and our underwriters use several different types of information about you, any additional policyholders and beneficiaries.

Below we have set out the types of information we and our underwriters use or hold about you for our Roadside policy or products. If you hold an insurance policy or other AA products or services (such as financial service or travel products), you should also read the privacy notice for those products or services to understand what other data we might hold. The next section tells you how we use your information.

* Personal and contact details, your date of birth, gender and/or age;
* Product beneficiaries, users and policy holders;
* Records of your contact with us and your payment details;
* Details of products and services you hold or have held, as well as your use of them and any claims or breakdowns, and any expressions of interest in the AA or its business partners.

* Details of breakdowns, call outs, and claims made by you, your policy holders or policy beneficiaries, and product eligibility (such as whether you have an up-to-date MOT, up-to-date tax, or whether your vehicle is listed as being off the road or you provided the DVLA with a Statutory Off Road Notification “SORN”);
* Pricing and risk data about you, your beneficiaries or policyholders. This data is used, for example, to assess or make a decision about policy risk, decide or set pricing or risk levels, and decide whether we can offer or continue to offer you a product or service. This may use details such as your AA product or service holdings and use (including usage, claims or breakdown data), credit data, marketing data and risk profiles, suspected fraud, data from third parties (see below), vehicle and driving details, and telematics details;
* Marketing information, including records of marketing communications, details of what you may be interested in, analysis and profiles we build up about you and your interests, and whether you open or read communications or links;
* Vehicle information, including make, model, age, usage, breakdowns, repairs, and faults;
* Telematics and connected car information about your vehicle (including assessing and predicting faults or issues), driving style (including recommending improvements and assessing risk associated with your driving style), and where permitted, the location and routes taken. This will be the case if you have the Vixa app;
* Information which we obtain from Credit Reference Agencies and Fraud Prevention Agencies (see below);
* Fraud, debt and theft information related to any of the products you hold with the AA;
* Information about your health or if you are a vulnerable customer - for example, details of assistance required – if these are needed to provide your policy to you;
* Criminal records information, including alleged offences if this necessary for your policy;
* Your marital status, family, lifestyle or social circumstances;
* Information from third parties, including demographic information, vehicle details, details of outstanding finance, claims details, fraud prevention databases, property, geographic and demographic details, marketing data, publicly available information (e.g. electoral roll and court judgments), and information to help improve the relevance of our products and services or to help us manage our products and services, pricing or risk;
* Details of your usage of any of our websites or apps, details of your phone and its software (e.g. browser and set up information), browsing history, and other details obtained via cookies or similar technologies (see our Cookie Notice for more details); and
* Third party transactions, such as where a person other than the account holder pays for or uses the service(s).
* Video footage or CCTV images when visiting one of our sites.

We may be unable to provide you with our products or services if you do not provide certain information to us. In cases where providing some personal information is optional, we’ll make this clear.

Withdrawing your consent
------------------------

Where we rely on your consent, you can withdraw it at any time by using the contact details in the Contact Us section below.

Transfers outside of the UK and Europe
--------------------------------------

Your personal information may be transferred outside the UK or European Economic Area, for example to service providers. If we do so, we’ll make sure that suitable safeguards are in place where required, for example by using approved contractual agreements or other legal arrangements unless certain exceptions apply.

Sharing with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you apply for credit or take a product on the basis of us offering credit, to process your application we will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more Credit Reference Agencies (**CRAs**) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (**FPAs**). When you take out a Roadside policy or product from us we will also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your account with us. To do this, we and our underwriters supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they will give us information about you. This will include information about your financial situation and financial history. CRAs and FPAs will supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit, financial situation, insurance and financial history information and fraud prevention information.

If you have credit, we any continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We will also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts. The identities of the CRAs and FPAs, their role as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail on our website. When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.

If you’re making a joint application or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together, so you should make sure you discuss this with them, and share with them this information, before lodging the application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.

For some products and services, we and our underwriters may also use FRAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigation potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We will share information with FRAs about your insurance policy application and policies in order to help us do this. This information may be given to other organisations. We will also use digital fraud prevention organisations to help us identify devices linked to fraud. This information, which can include device ID and IP address, may be shared with fraud prevention organisations who in turn may make it available to other companies.

We will also use FPAs, such as Experian and commercially available fraud prevention services and claims services to prevent, detect and investigation potential fraud. We will share information with FPAs about your application and policies in order to help us do this. This information will be given to other organisations. **[More information can be found here](https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&SP_RID=2779500-g&elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&elqaid=14031&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=).**

Changes to your data
--------------------

You should tell us if the personal information you have provided to us changes so that we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your policy documents. We’ll then update your records if we can.

Monitoring communications
-------------------------

We may monitor communications with you, which may include recording telephone calls to and from our business, where permitted by law. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data, and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.

Use of automated decisions
--------------------------

We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individuals have been involved. We do this to decide whether to offer you a product or service, to determine the risk of doing so, the price we will offer, whether to offer you credit, what terms and condition to offer you, assess lending, insurance and business risks, or to assess what payment methods we can offer you. We may do this using data from other parts of the AA (AA Group and AA branded companies) and policy underwriters, including product or services details (including usage of claims made) and telematics data captured, including on your vehicle, driving behaviour and location information.

To understand the logic involved in this and why we do this, you may wish to consider the following example:

* Assess your credit worthiness and ability – for example, if you are applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not able to offer you credit or do so at a higher rate.
* Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts – for example, we will take account of your history of using your policy or policies. If you or your beneficiaries make claims or have calls outs or, or if we have concerns about potential use of a policy (for example, if you are in breach of the conditions) or circumstances this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.
* Assess the risk of fraud – if we believe there is a significant risk of fraud, based on the information we hold or that is available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price or decline or cancel your policy or application.

We do this because it is necessary for entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We may do so if it is authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.

Retention of your personal data
-------------------------------

Unless we explain otherwise to you, we’ll hold your personal information based on the following criteria:

* For as long as we provide products or services to you and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us;
* To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance; or
* For as long as we have reasonable business needs.

How to request deletion of your AA online account
-------------------------------------------------

You can request to delete your AA online account using by contacting us on **0330 102 8005**.

We will delete your online account – however, we will need to retain some of your personal data you provided to us. Please see more details above. After your account has been deleted, you won’t be able to use the AA app any longer or log in to your AA account on our website, but any policies you hold with us won’t be affected. If you’d like to cancel or make changes to your policy, you’ll need to do this separately.

Your data protection rights
