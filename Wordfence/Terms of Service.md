**Disclaimer of Warranties**  
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” AND THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE AND PERFORMANCE REMAINS WITH YOU. THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE: (A) WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS; (B) WILL BE AVAILABLE OR PROVIDED ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS; (C) WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR RELIABLE, OR (D) WILL BE FREE FROM VIRUSES, WORMS, OR OTHER HARMFUL OR MALICIOUS COMPONENTS, NOR DO WE WARRANT THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WITH THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED.

**Disclaimer of Certain Damages**  
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; FOR LOSS OF PROFITS; LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION; OR ANY OTHER LOSS OR ANY KIND, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, BASED ON, RESULTING FROM, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS, EVEN IF WE OR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY**  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE NOT EXCLUDED OR DISCLAIMED UNDER THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES OR DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES SECTIONS, OUR MAXIMUM, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU, AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THESE TERMS FOR ANY AND ALL DAMAGES, INJURIES, AND LOSSES ARISING FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF, BASED ON, RESULTING FROM, OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE MONIES PAID BY YOU TO COMPANY IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE RELEVANT CLAIM OR $10, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. THE EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR SUITS UNDER OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SITE WILL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THE LIMITATION OF MONEY DAMAGES.

**Independent Remedies**  
The Disclaimer of Certain Damages Section is independent of your exclusive remedy in the Limitation of Liability and Exclusive Remedy Section and it survives even if the exclusive remedy fails of its essential purpose or otherwise is deemed unenforceable. Each of the limitations of liability above apply without regard to whether loss, liability, or damage arise from (a) breach of contract, (b) breach of warranty, (c) fault or tort, including negligence and misrepresentation, (d) strict liability, or (e) any other cause of action, to the extent the exclusions and limitations are not prohibited by applicable law.

**Indemnity**  
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Site and Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of these Terms; or (iii) your violation of any third-party rights, including without limitation any privacy or intellectual property rights.

**Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action Waiver; and Location of Dispute Resolution**  
You and the Company each agree that all claims, controversies, and disputes between you and the Company, including those arising out of or related to the Site, our products, or these Terms (each a “Dispute” and collectively the “Disputes”), will be resolved by binding arbitration by a single neutral arbitrator, provided, however, you and the Company are not precluded from asserting in small claims court any Dispute that is eligible to be brought in small claims court. BY AGREEING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO FOREGO THE ABILITY TO PURSUE DISPUTES IN COURT, OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO HAVE A JURY DECIDE DISPUTES. Unless you and the Company otherwise agree, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will arbitrate all disputes and the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (but excluding AAA’s Supplemental Rules for Class Arbitration) will apply, except to the extent the provisions of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules are different from, conflict with, and/or are inconsistent with the terms of this Section, in which case the provisions of this Section will control and must be followed as written. You and the Company each agree to only pursue Disputes on an individual basis and will not pursue Disputes, whether in arbitration or otherwise, on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, regardless of the application of procedural rules. BY AGREEING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO FORGO THE ABILITY TO PROCEED IN CLASS ACTIONS, CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, EITHER AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF OR MEMBER OF A CLASS. Notwithstanding any AAA rule to the contrary, or any other provision in arbitration rules chosen by agreement to govern the arbitration, you and the Company each agree that any challenges to the validity or enforceability of the class action waiver in this Section will be decided by a federal court or a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by an arbitrator. If any court or arbitrator holds that the class action waiver in this Section is unenforceable, then the Dispute must be brought in a state or federal court, and not in arbitration. If any portion of this arbitration provision other than the class action waiver will be found to be unenforceable, that portion will be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will remain in effect. A copy of the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules is available at www.adr.org/commercial and is incorporated herein by this reference as though set forth in full. If you reside in the United States, you and the Company each agree that the location of the arbitration or court where the Dispute will be resolved will be Seattle, Washington if you live west of the Mississippi River, and in Chicago, Illinois, if you live east of the Mississippi River. If you do not reside in the United States, you and the Company each agree that the location of the arbitration or court where the Dispute will be resolved will be Seattle, Washington. You and the Company each also agree that for arbitrated Disputes, the arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. An arbitrator may award, on an individual basis, any relief authorized by law, including injunctive or declaratory relief and reasonable attorneys’ fees. You and the Company each are responsible for your or its respective costs relating to the arbitration. You and the Company each are responsible for your own respective costs relating to the arbitration, except that the Company will pay the arbitration administrative or filing fees, including the arbitrator fees (other than arbitrator fees up to the amount of the then-applicable fee for filing a civil action in federal court in the judicial district where you live in any Dispute where you assert a claim against the Company, unless you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you would be entitled to file that civil action in federal court without payment of the then-applicable fee). To begin arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Dispute to the address listed for the Company in this Section. You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section by mailing the Company written notice of your election to opt out at Defiant, Inc., 1700 Westlake Ave N Ste 200, Seattle, WA 98109 and privacy@defiant.com within 45 days of agreeing to these Terms, expressly indicating that you are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section and including your name and address, provided that the election will not be effective until it is received by the Company. Your election to opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section will not otherwise affect your rights and obligations under these Terms. You and the Company each also agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, so the Federal Arbitration Act, not state law, applies including with respect to any question of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration (despite the choice of governing law). In accordance with the FAA, the appointed arbitrator must interpret, apply and enforce this Section as written.

**Force Majeure**  
The Company will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform or delay in performance of any of the obligations under these Terms that is caused by an act or event beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation act of God, strikes, lock-outs or other industrial action by third parties, civil commotion, riot, terrorist attack, war, fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, epidemic or other natural disaster, failure of public or private telecommunications networks or impossibility of the use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport or other means of public or private transport.

**Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Venue**  
These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington without reference to its conflict of laws provisions. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts sitting in King County, Washington, for any and all disputes, claims, and actions arising from or in connection with the Service, Site, or these Terms.

**Changes to These Terms**  
We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time upon notice to you. We may give notice by making the updated Terms available through the Service or by any other reasonable means. You can review the most current Terms at any time at: https://www.wordfence.com/terms-of-use/. When we change these Terms, we will require you to accept the updated Terms to continue using the Service. If you do not accept the updated Terms, you may not continue to use the Service. Updated Terms are binding on you on the effective date indicated at the top of these Terms.

**Notices**  
We may give you all notices (including legal process) that we are required to give by any lawful method, including by making notice available through the Service or by sending it to any email or mailing address that you provide to us. You acknowledge that if you do not provide us with current and accurate contact information, we may not be able to contact you. You agree to send us notice by emailing it to the following address: privacy@defiant.com.

**General**  
These Terms, together with any amendments, incorporated terms or policies, and any additional agreements you may enter into with the Company, will constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms, which will remain in full force and effect. Section titles are only for convenience and have no legal or contractual significance. No waiver of any portion of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the Company’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. A waiver will only be binding on us if it is in writing and signed by us. The Company may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign these Terms or assign, transfer, or sublicense your rights, if any, in the Service. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL ANY CLAIM, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BE INSTITUTED MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. The Limitation of Liability, Indemnity, and Governing Law Sections of these Terms survive any termination.

If you have any questions or concerns in regards to these Terms, please contact privacy@defiant.com.
