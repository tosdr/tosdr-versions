Membean will only use such personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of our [privacy policy](https://membean.com/policies/privacy.html) _(the “Privacy Policy”)_. In this regard, you agree to the then-current version of the Privacy Policy that you can [find and read here](https://membean.com/policies/privacy.html). You hereby agree that we may use your personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy.

Membean requires Schools and/or Teachers to obtain Consent from Students' Parents or Guardians before collecting any such personal information. If you are a Student, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you are able to sign up for the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a Student without a Consent being obtained by his or her School and/or Teacher, or if we learn a Student has provided us personal information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Service, we will permanently delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a Student may have provided us personal information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Service, or that a Student's School or Teacher has not obtained a valid Consent prior to our collection of any personal information, please contact us at [support@membean.com](mailto:support@membean.com).

**19.2** The failure of Membean to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
