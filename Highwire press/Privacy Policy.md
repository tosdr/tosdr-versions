We process two main types of personal data.

1. **Customer Data –** Personal data that forms part of data that is provided by our customers and their end-users for processing.
2. **Other Data –** Personal data about our customers, visitors and other individuals that is collected and processed directly by us.

Our Customers are the Controller of **Customer Data**.

MPS is the processor of **Customer Data** and the Controller of **Other Data**.

### **Information We Collect and How We Use It**

MPS collects, processes, and retains information about you when you visit our website if you choose to provide. You may choose to provide some of this information directly, such as when you submit the “Contact Us” form or any other registration forms. We use the contact information we collect to respond to your enquiry or to allow you to access specific account information. We may execute other activities, such as marketing campaigns, promotional communications for which consent is taken appropriately, or another appropriate lawful base for which the processing is identified.

You may visit our website without telling us who you are. When you visit our website, our web servers or our analytics services collect IP addresses, operating system details, browsing details, device details, and language settings. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, and similar information. MPS uses this information to measure the site usage, improve content, and ensure safety and security as well enhance the performance of the website.

You can make choices about our collection and use of your data. You may decline when you are asked to provide personal data. The data that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with MPS and the choices you make, including your privacy settings. We collect your first name, last name, phone number, email address, job title, company, state, region, and other information.

### **Personal Information We Collect About You**

You may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) to us. We list below the methods by which you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. We also tell you how we may use the information.

### **Contact Us**

If you communicate with our Customer Services department through the ‘Contact Us’ link on our website or by post or telephone, we may ask you for information such as your email address, your location and the type of customer you are (e.g. registrant, website visitor etc.). You may also choose to provide additional personal information, for example, in the form of an attachment or by post. We will hold these details in our customer services query database and use such personal information to respond to your questions and comments. We may also use such personal information to evaluate the quality of our products and services.

### **Work @ MPS Limited**

You may submit your CV and other information online through our careers page to apply for a job with MPS. We use the information you submit to evaluate your suitability for the position and to contact you regarding your application.

We collect this information either through “cookie” technology or with “web beacons,” as explained below.

We do not sell or otherwise disclose information about our website visitors, except as described here. We may share the information you provide with affiliates of MPS (i.e., companies in our group) and our joint marketing partners. We may also share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you:

(i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process,

(ii) to law enforcement agencies following an appropriate request, or

(iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use information you have provided through our website(s) in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

### **How We Protect Personal Information**

Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you easy means to access, modify, delete, object to or restrict use of your personal information.

MPS will provide website users with access to a copy of their personal information which they have provided through our site(s), where such users are reasonably entitled to ask for this, (for which we may charge a small fee not exceeding the statutory maximum) and they will have the ability to review and correct it, as applicable. You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you). You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).

To help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your information.
