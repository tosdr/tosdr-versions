This helps schools understand your next steps and enables them to plan.
* Information about the services that you use, together with other related information, including data about your progress after using our services, such as what salary you achieve or details about any further education to which you move. This helps schools understand what happens to their students when they leave school,and it helps them meet their obligations to supply data to Ofsted and the Government.

* This information is also visible to all staff at your school to help them give you personalised careers advice.
