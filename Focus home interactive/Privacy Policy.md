**\*\*** "Customer match" is a way to create an advertising audience using user's e-mail address. We share with our partners (such as Facebook, Google or Twitter/X) a list of hashed e-mails and they compare with their users. If there is a match, the user is added in an audience pool. If you accept "customer match", you give us the authorization to share your hashed e-mail with our partners in order to display personalized ads on their websites.

The Data collected are kept only for the time necessary to achieve the objective pursued during their collection (so-called “active” use) and in accordance with the applicable laws.

Focus Entertainment may retain your Data for longer periods, in intermediate archiving (separate from the active base and with restricted access), when justified: for the exercise of our legal obligations (limitation period) and/or the protection of our rights (foreclosure period), particularly in commercial, civil and tax matter, i.e. a maximum of 10 years; but also in the event of litigation during the entire duration of the proceedings and up to 10 years from the execution of the final decision.

Once these deadlines have expired, we will delete or anonymise your Data.

**3\. With whom does Focus Entertainment share my Data?**

**Communication of your Data to our service providers and suppliers**

As a video games publisher, certain Data we collect may be communicated and/or shared with: our development studios, our law firms and technical and IT service providers or our suppliers. Where appropriate, communication and/or sharing is carried out for technical and operational purposes, to enable us to offer you high-performance games, provide you the requested products and/or services.

In the context of recruitment, certain Data that we collect may be communicated and/or shared with our recruitment service providers.

In all cases, we implement the necessary contractual and organisational measures so that the processing of your Data by these third-party providers is strictly limited to the purposes defined in this Policy and to guarantee the confidentiality and security of your Data.

**Communication of your Data by our partners**

Some partners may need to request your consent for the collection of Data in our video games, on their own behalf. This Policy does not apply to such processing implemented by these partners, acting as independent controllers. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy policy of each of these partners.

**4.What are my rights and how do I exercise them?**

**5.** **Transfer of your Data outside the EEA**

 Focus Entertainment may transfer some of your Data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for technical and operational purposes, to enable us to offer you high-performing games and to provide you with the requested services. These transfers are carried out in accordance with applicable data protection regulations and transfer management solutions recognised by the GDPR.

 In particular, when the transfer of your Data cannot be carried out on the basis of an adequacy decision of the European Commission recognising an adequate level of protection, we put in place other appropriate transfer mechanisms and safeguards to ensure the protection of your Data, in particular data transfer agreements including standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission in their version in force at the time of the transfer concerned, or other device recognised by this regulation, including the new EU-US Data Protection Framework.

For more information on the safeguards related to the transfer of Data, you are invited to contact us at the following address: [**personaldata@focusent.com**.](mailto:personaldata@focusent.com)

As an example and without this list being exhaustive, we maintain:

* an authentication system to protect access to your online accounts;
    
* hashing procedures for some of your Data;
    
* limited access (authorisation policy) to only employees and/or processors of Focus Entertainment who need to know it due to their duties, when required to provide our services to you and subject to strict confidentiality obligations; etc.
