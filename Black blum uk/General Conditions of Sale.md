DELIVERY & RETURNS
==================

SECTION 1 - RETURNS  
  
If you are unhappy with anything we have sent you, please always let us know first by email to askme@black-blum.com or call +(44) 207 633 0022 from Europe or toll free 877 360 9222 from the USA. We can not guarantee the correct processing of returns which are sent to our office or returns to any of our warehouses without any information or prior communication.  
  
We accept returns of unused products in their original packaging and in resellable condition, within 14 working days after delivery of your order. If 45 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange. Please enclose a copy of your invoice or delivery note for identification purposes. Refunds will be issued within 10 days of receipt of the returned goods.  
  
SECTION 2 - RETURNS SHIPPING

Return costs are not pre-paid. Postage or other return costs will be the customer’s responsibility and will be reimbursed by us only in the case of damaged, faulty or incorrectly supplied goods. You must return the goods, together with their packaging and enclosing a copy of your invoice or delivery note for identification purposes, in the same condition as supplied to you.

Address for Returns of Goods: If you need to return Goods to us for whatever reason, then please send such items to:

For UK: Trade Counter Distribution Ltd, c/o Black+Blum, Mendlesham Industrial Estate, Norwich Road, Mendlesham, Suffolk, IP14 5ND.

For Europe: BLACK+BLUM s/p Brain E-Log, Boulevard de la Technicité 1A, 7110 Houdeng Goegnies, Belgique

For USA: Black+Blum Returns, c/o Entermarket,445 Airtech Pkwy, Plainfield, IN 46168

  
SECTION 3 - REFUNDS  
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item and of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a few days.  
  
You will be under a duty to take reasonable care of the goods received. We reserve the right to refuse a refund on Goods returned which have been made unfit for resale or damaged whilst in your possession.  
  
SECTION 4 - NON-RETURNABLE / REFUNDABLE ITEMS  
Gift cards & Ex-display items on sale are non returnable or refundable.

Our glass bottles and carafes are excluded from the 2 year warranty except in the following condition: you received your purchase and found to your great disappointment that your product has broken somewhere between our place and yours. In that case we will replace it free of charge if you notify us within five days of receipt (please have your camera ready to snap a picture of the bottle and the cardboard box it came in).  
If the bottle broke after that time, then unfortunately, it won’t be replaced for free. Though our glass bottles are made of durable borosilicate glass, it still can break if dropped, chipped or the charcoal stick was placed in the empty bottle/carafe (these sticks are pretty hard!).  
  
SECTION 5 - ORDER CANCELLATION  
Cancellation notice must be given before the dispatch of the order. Please call us during working hours on +(44) 207 633 0022 from Europe or toll free 877 360 9222 from the USA if you wish to cancel an order, or email askme@black-blum.com immediately.

You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item.  
  
Gifts  
If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.  
If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he will find out about your return.  
  
The time for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary depending on where you live,  
  
If you are shipping an item over £30/$50/€40, please consider using a trackable shipping service or purchase shipping insurance. We do not guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
