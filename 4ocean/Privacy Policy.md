Last updated: June 29, 2023

At 4ocean, We recognize and respect Your privacy when You use Our Service. This Privacy Policy describes Our Policies and Procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You. If You have any questions about this Policy, we encourage You to contact us at info@4ocean.com.

When You use Our Service, with the help of Our Third-Party Authorized Agents, We collect information to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Interpretation and Definitions**

**Interpretation**

The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.

**Definitions**

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

**Account** means a unique account created for You to access our Service or parts of our Service.

**Business**, for the purpose of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), refers to the Company as the legal entity that collects Consumers' personal information and determines the purposes and means of the processing of Consumers' personal information, or on behalf of which such information is collected and that alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumers' personal information, that does business in the State of California.

**Company** (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to 4ocean PBC, [3600 FAU BLVD BOCA RATON FL. 33431](https://www.google.com/maps/search/3600+FAU+BLVD+BOCA+RATON+FL.+33431?entry=gmail&source=g).

For the purpose of the GDPR, the Company is the Data Controller.

**Consumer**, for the purpose of the CCPA, means a natural person who is a California resident. A resident, as defined in the law, includes (1) every individual who is in the USA for other than a temporary or transitory purpose, and (2) every individual who is domiciled in the USA who is outside the USA for a temporary or transitory purpose.

For the purposes of the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), a Consumer is “a natural person who is a resident of the Commonwealth acting only in an individual or household content. It does not include a natural person acting in a commercial or employment context.”  

**Cookies** are small files that are placed on Your computer, mobile device or any other device by a website, containing the details of Your browsing history on that website among its many uses.

**Cross-context behavioral advertising**, as defined by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) is “the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on the consumer's personal information obtained from the consumer's activity across businesses, distinctly-branded websites, applications, or services, other than the business, distinctly-branded website, application, or service with which the consumer intentionally interacts.”

**Data Controller**, for the purposes of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), refers to the Company as the legal person which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data.

For the purposes of the VCDPA, **controller** is defined as “defined as a natural or legal person that, alone or jointly with others, determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, and **processor** is defined as “defined as a natural or legal person that processes personal data on behalf of a controller.” 

**Device** means any device that can access the Service such as a computer, a cellphone, or a digital tablet.

**Do Not Track** (DNT) is a concept that has been promoted by US regulatory authorities, in particular the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.

**Personal Data** is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

For the purposes for GDPR, Personal Data means any information relating to You such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.

For the purposes of the CCPA, Personal Data means any information that identifies, relates to, describes or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with You.

For the purposes of the VCDPA, Personal Data means “any information that is linked or reasonably linkable an identified or identifiable natural person.” Exceptions to this definition include: publicly available information and data which has been de-identified (information that "cannot reasonably be linked to an identified or identifiable natural person \[or\] a device linked to such person").

**Sale**, for the purpose of the CCPA, means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a Consumer's personal information to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.

For the purposes of the VCDPA, “sale” means the exchange of personal data for monetary consideration. 

**Service** refers to the Website.

**Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Company. It refers to third-party companies or individuals employed by the Company to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on behalf of the Company, to perform services related to the Service or to assist the Company in analyzing how the Service is used. For the purpose of the GDPR, Service Providers are considered Data Processors.

**Targeted Advertising**, for the purposes of the VCDPA, means “displaying advertisements to a consumer where the advertisement is selected based on personal data obtained from that consumer's activities over time and across nonaffiliated websites or online applications to predict such consumer's preferences or interests;” and specifically excludes advertisements based on activities within a controller's own websites or online applications; advertisements based on the context of a consumer's current search query, visit to a website, or online application; advertisements directed to a consumer in response to the consumer's request for information or feedback; and

processing personal data processed solely for measuring or reporting advertising performance, reach, or frequency.

**Third-party Social Media Service** refers to any website or any social network website through which a User can log in or create an account to use the Service.

**Usage Data** refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).

**Website** refers to 4ocean, accessible from [www.4ocean.com](https://www.termsfeed.com/live/www.4ocean.com)

**You** means the individual accessing or using the Service, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Service, as applicable.

Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), You can be referred to as the Data Subject or as the User as you are the individual using the Service.

This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.

Please note that the categories listed below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal information were in fact sold, but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information from the applicable category may be and may have been shared for value in return.
