**N. Warranty Disclaimer**

**YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, 4OCEAN, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON INFRINGMENT, IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE AND YOUR USE THEREOF. THE WEBSITE AND THE WEBSITE MATERIAL ARE PROVIDED BY 4OCEAN ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. 4OCEAN MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE WEBSITE MATERIAL OR THE CONTENT OF ANY SITES LINKED TO THE WEBSITE AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF MATERIAL ON THE WEBSITE, (II) PERSONAL INJURY (EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION M ABOVE) OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE WEBSITE, (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS, (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR WEBSITE, (IV) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE BY ANY THIRD PARTY, AND/OR (V) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY WEBSITE MATERIAL. 4OCEAN DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR ANY WEBSITE HYPERLINKED OR FEATURED IN ANY BANNER OR OTHER ADVERTISING, AND 4OCEAN WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS**

**O. Indemnity**

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless 4ocean, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Website; (ii) your violation of any term of the Use Policy; or (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy license or right. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive the Use Policy and your use of the Website.

**P. Assignment**

The terms of this Use Policy, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by 4ocean without restriction.

**Q. Jurisdiction and Disputes**

**Any dispute or claim arising from or relating in any way to your use of the Website, or to any products or services sold or distributed by 4ocean or through the Website will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Use Policy. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must interpret and apply the terms of this Use Policy just as a court would. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that You or we may bring suit in court to seek injunctive relief for infringement or other threatened or actual violation of intellectual property rights.** To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent 4ocean Public Benefit Corporation, Attention: Alex J. Schulze, Registered Agent, 3600 FAU Boulevard, Boca Raton, FL 33431. The arbitration will be conducted by and under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Boca Raton, Florida, or at another mutually agreed location.

**R. Designated Agent**

All notices and communications with respect to the Use Policy are to be directed in writing by e-mail to info@4ocean.com

**S. Cancellation Policy**

All subscriptions provided by 4ocean PBC will automatically renew on the 15th of the month at the end of your subscription period (Monthly, 3 months, 6 months of 12 months). Cancellation requests must be submitted by email to info@4ocean.com at least 48 hours before the renewal date. Cancellation notice sent to info@4ocean.com will terminate future Clean Ocean Club orders and automatic renewals will end.

**T. Contact Information**

If you need to contact us for any reason not otherwise provided above, our address is 4ocean Public Benefit Corporation, 3600 FAU Boulevard, Boca Raton, FL 33431; e-mail: info@4ocean.com

Rev.010716

**Disclaimer:**

The ratio of one product to one pound of trash removed is an approximation based on total revenues of the bracelets and total trash removed from the ocean by 4ocean within 12 months of the period of time that the bracelet was sold. Some of the trash that has been allocated to the 4ocean one pound per bracelet pledge throughout this website may not have been removed straight from the ocean but from a coastline and is considered ocean-bound trash. 4ocean defines the term "Trash" as any man made material that does not belong in the ocean and is damaging to the environment. 

**Net Profit:** The Net Profit for temporary campaigns will be calculated as: The total sales accrued from the particular bracelet subtracted from the Cost of Goods Sold, the operating expenses from the period of time that the bracelet was for sale, and the operating/marketing expenses that were incurred specific to the bracelet campaign.

4ocean attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, 4ocean does not warrant that product descriptions or other content or Website material is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.

4ocean cannot confirm the price of an item until You order. Despite our efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced.

We generally do not charge Your credit card until after Your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until We make the digital product available to You.

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless 4ocean, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) Your use of and access to the Website; (ii) Your violation of any term of the Use Policy; or (iii) Your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy license or right. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive the Use Policy and Your use of the Website.

1. **Assignment**

The terms of this Use Policy, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You, but may be assigned by 4ocean without restriction.

1. **Jurisdiction and Disputes**

**Except where and to the extent prohibited by law, by using the Website You and We agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to Your use of the Website, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement or any part of it (“Dispute”), both Parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other Party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settlement the Dispute.** 

**Notice can be sent to: 4ocean Public Benefit Corporation, Attention: 4ocean, Legal Dept., 3600 FAU Boulevard, Boca Raton, FL 33431.**

**You and We agree that this dispute resolution process is a condition that must be satisfied before initiating any other action or filing any claim against the other Party.**

**Any Dispute or claim arising from or relating in any way to Your use of the Website, or to any products or services sold or distributed by 4ocean or through the Website that cannot be resolved between the Parties will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Use Policy. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must interpret and apply the terms of this Use Policy just as a court would. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, We each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that You or We may bring suit in court to seek injunctive relief for infringement or other threatened or actual violation of intellectual property rights.** 

To begin an arbitration proceeding, You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing Your claim to 4ocean Public Benefit Corporation, Attention: 4ocean, Legal Dept., 3600 FAU Boulevard, Boca Raton, FL 33431. The arbitration will be conducted by and under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Boca Raton, Florida, or at another mutually agreed location.

Any claim or cause of action You may have with respect to 4ocean or the Website must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose.

1. **Comments and Other Submissions**

We welcome Your comments and feedback about the Website and our products. In some places the Website enables You to upload, store, and send content such as sweepstakes and contest entries, photographs, images, product reviews, testimonials, suggestions, ideas, comments or other communications (collectively, “Comments”). When You send Comments to us, whether through the Website, social media, email, phone, postal mail, or otherwise, You give to 4ocean permission to reproduce and use Your Comments as follows: You grant to Us and those We work with a license without restriction to use, reproduce, sublicense, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, copy, host, store, publicly perform, and publicly display the Comments in any medium now known or later developed. You should not submit any Comments to Us that You do not wish to license to us. Our license to Your Comments is non-exclusive, meaning You may use the Comments for Your own purposes or let others use Your Comments for their purposes. This license is fully-paid and royalty free, meaning We do not owe You anything else in connection with our use of Your Comments. We may exercise our rights under this license anywhere in the world. Lastly, this license is perpetual, meaning that our rights under this license continue even after You stop using the Website. 4ocean is under no obligation: (1) to maintain Comments in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for Comments; (3) to respond to Comments; or (4) to use Comments. You grant 4ocean the right to use the name You submit with Your Comments.

You agree that Your Comments will not violate any right of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy or other personal or proprietary right. You further agree that Your Comments will not contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive, or obscene material, or contain any computer virus or other malware that could in any way affect the operation of the Website. You may not use a false email address, pretend to be someone other than Yourself, or otherwise mislead Us or third parties as to the origin of any Comments. You agree to clearly and conspicuously disclose if You received compensation or other incentive of any kind, from any source, in exchange for posting Comments. You are solely responsible for any Comments You make and their accuracy. 4ocean takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Comments posted by You or any third party.

1. **General Information:**

These terms constitute the entire agreement between You and 4ocean and govern Your use of the Website, superseding any prior agreements between You and 4ocean. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that are applicable to certain parts of the Website. 

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between 4ocean and You as a result of this Agreement or Your use of the Website, purchase of 4ocean products, or participating in the Clean Ocean Club. 

The failure of 4ocean to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the terms shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or provisions. If any of the provision of the terms if found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the Parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the Parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the terms remain in full force and effect. 

The terms inure to the benefit of 4ocean’s successors, assigns, and licensees.

1. **Disclaimer:**

The ratio of one product to one pound of trash removed is an approximation based on total revenues of the bracelets and total trash removed from the ocean by 4ocean within 12 months of the period of time that the bracelet was sold. Some of the trash that has been allocated to the 4ocean one pound per bracelet pledge throughout this website may not have been removed straight from the ocean but from a coastline and is considered ocean-bound trash. 4ocean defines the term "Trash" as any man made material that does not belong in the ocean and is damaging to the environment. 

**Net Profit:** The Net Profit for temporary campaigns will be calculated as: The total sales accrued from the particular bracelet subtracted from the Cost of Goods Sold, the operating expenses from the period of time that the bracelet was for sale, and the operating/marketing expenses that were incurred specific to the bracelet campaign.
