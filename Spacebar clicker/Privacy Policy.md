### COOKIES

#### What are cookies?

Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer or device when you browse websites. They contain information related to the web browser and the specific website, and are saved in a designated folder on your hard drive. When you revisit a website, the cookie can be used to recognize the visitor and provide a personalized browsing experience based on their history. Web beacons are typically small, transparent graphic images that are placed on websites and used to monitor user behavior.

Cookies are used to improve the user experience by enhancing visitor friendliness. By using cookies to identify visitors, users do not have to repeatedly enter the same information, such as login credentials or screen settings, each time they visit a website.

#### Which kind of cookies exist?

Often, a distinction is made between two large groups of cookies:

**First-party cookies**: These cookies are created by the website you are visiting to enhance its performance. These cookies regulate the technical aspects of a site, such as language preferences or remembering items in an online shopping cart. First-party cookies are generated and placed by the visited website.

**Third-party cookies**: These cookies are created and placed on your device by a third-party other than the website you are visiting. They track a user's browsing behavior and are commonly used by social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, as well as by tools like Google Analytics to measure website traffic.

Cookies that are necessary for the proper functioning of the site do not require permission. However, all other types of cookies do require permission.

#### Which cookies do we use?

We will only use first-party cookies to enhance your user experience while browsing the Site. These cookies record specific information about your visit, such as your language preference, the pages visited, and the duration of your visit.

In some cases, we may provide games from third-party game distributors on our portal. By playing a game provided by a third party, your Personal Data may be processed by them through the use of cookies or similar technology. It's important to note that playing a third-party game means you're playing within the environment of that game's developer, over which we have no control. We strongly recommend that you review the privacy policy of any game distributor before playing a game.
