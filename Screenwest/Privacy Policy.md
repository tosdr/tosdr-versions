Privacy Policy
==============

Your privacy is important.

[Jump to page content](#readnow) [How will Screenwest use the personal information provided?](#how-will-screenwest-use-the-personal-information-provided) [Enquiries and Privacy Complaints](#enquiries-and-privacy-complaints) [Website Privacy Policy](#website-privacy-policy)

Screenwest (Australia) Limited is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Commonwealth Privacy Act (1988). This requires we comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in the Act and any amendments, including those that came into force on 12 March 2014.

### The current Privacy Act allows you to:

* know why your personal information is being collected, how it will be used and who it will be disclosed to.
* have the option of not identifying yourself, or of using a pseudonym. Screenwest will require your full name if you seek funding.
* ask for access to your personal information.
* stop receiving unwanted direct marketing.
* ask for your personal information to be corrected if it is incorrect.
* make a complaint about an entity covered by the Privacy Act, if you believe they have mishandled your personal information.

The Act requires organisations to have a Privacy Policy in place. This statement outlines Screenwest’s policy on how we use and manage all personal information provided to or collected by the organisation.

Screenwest may review and update this Privacy Policy to:

* consider new laws and technology
* reflect changes to the organisation’s operations and practices, and
* make sure it remains appropriate to the changing legal environment.

The type of information Screenwest collects and holds includes but is not limited to personal information. This can include sensitive information, including but not limited to:

* Names.
* Contact Details such as postal addresses, home addresses, email addresses and phone numbers.

Where Screenwest is provided information about a third-party event, for example when submitting an event to the [WA Screen Industry Calendar](https://www.screenwest.com.au/wa-screen-industry-calendar/), we accept the submission as consent to publish the provided details, along with any contact details for inquiries, unless otherwise advised.

Please read the [WA Screen Industry Calendar Terms and Conditions](https://www.screenwest.com.au/wa-screen-industry-calendar/) for further information.

How will Screenwest use the personal information provided?
----------------------------------------------------------

Screenwest will use personal information it collects from you for:

* the primary purpose stated at collection, and
* secondary purposes related to the primary purpose of collection and are reasonably expected, or to which you have consented.

Screenwest will use your information for direct marketing where you have provided that information and you are likely to expect direct marketing. All communications will include a clear opt-out.

Personal information that is no longer required will be de-identified or destroyed. In many circumstances however, it will be kept for marketing purposes according to your consent or opt-in requirements.
