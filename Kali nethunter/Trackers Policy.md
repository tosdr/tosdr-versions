We also run Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These cookies gather data on how visitors interact with the Site (as well as demographic data such as age and gender) to optimize website content and marketing.

If you have accessed our website via a Google Ad, Google places a cookie on your computer. When you visit the Site, we and Google can recognize that someone has clicked on an ad and been directed to our page as a result. This allows us to optimize our marketing and services and to understand the total number of customers who have clicked on our Google Ad and been redirected to the Site.

Google’s remarketing technology means that users who have already visited our Site and shown an interest in what we have to offer are shown targeted advertising on other websites of the Google Partner network. The ads are displayed through the use of cookies, and the user’s behavior during their visit to the website is analyzed and then used for targeted product recommendations and interest-based advertising.

When you visit a website that uses analytics tools like Google Analytics, your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page you’re visiting and your IP address. Google may also [set cookies on your browser](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en-US) or read cookies that are already there.

For more information on how Google uses information from sites that use its services and how you can control the information collected by Google please visit:
