#### 4\. PRICE, INVOICING, AND PAYMENT OF THE PRODUCTS

The product prices and stock shall be updated by the online store as information is received from the suppliers.

If the prices or any other details regarding the products were displayed erroneously, also because of their erroneous entry into the database, the Buyer acknowledges the Seller's right to cancel the Orders (requests for products which were not confirmed) containing such products and to notify the Customers on the occurring error as soon as possible.

The prices displayed within the Website include VAT in the case of EU countries and do not include VAT in the case of non-EU countries in accordance with the law in force, they are stated in the currency EUR (for the EU Website) and in USD (for the international Website). The reference currency for the calculation, payment and invoicing of the products ordered shall be in the currency EUR (for the EU Website) and USD (for the international Website).

The price, the payment method and the payment terms are stated in each Order. The Seller shall issue to the Buyer an invoice for the delivered goods and/or services, and the Buyer commits to provide all the information needed to issue the invoice under the law in force.

The Seller shall send to the Buyer the invoice related to the Order in electronic form, at the email address indicated by the Buyer in their Account created on the Website.

In case an Order is placed using a card in a currency other than the Website’s reference currency, your card issuing bank may operate the conversion into EUR/USD of the amount paid for the products purchased on the Website, with the possibility for your bank to charge a foreign exchange fee. You thus have the obligation to make inquiries regarding the existence of such fee before placing on Order on the Website. MEZE AUDIO shall not be liable for its Users’ lack of information regarding the fees charged by the bank. For clarification, in case of online payments, MEZE AUDIO is not/cannot be held liable for any additional costs covered by the Customer, including, without limitation, any foreign exchange fees applied by the bank issuing their card, if the currency in which it was issued is different from the reference currency. Responsibility for such action shall belong exclusively to the Customer.

If the payment is made by bank card, MEZE AUDIO shall debit the Customer’s current account with the amounts representing the equivalent value of the products ordered, after the Order Confirmation is sent to the latter.

All visual information used to describe the products available on the Website (static/dynamic images/ multimedia presentations/etc.) shall not constitute a contractual obligation on the part of the Website Owner, and they shall be used exclusively for presentation purposes.

Online payments shall be processed directly by the issuer bank through the payment partners. The payment system is secured at the highest standards, including 3D Secure. The Buyer’s payment card data shall not be accessible to or stored by MEZE AUDIO.

#### 5\. DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCTS

The delivery of the purchased products/services to the Customer shall be performed through a fast courier company for the performance of the transport services.

Deliveries shall be made within 3-10 business days from the Confirmation of the Order for the products which are in stock with the Seller. Delivery delays may occur, caused by stockouts in the online store or at the supplier, by internal technical issues or by external factors. The delivery term may vary from 3 business days to a maximum of 30 business days for Orders containing special requirements or Pre-Orders. The delivery terms shall be valid from the time the Order is confirmed, excluding non-business days and certain exceptional situations (for instance: adverse weather conditions, public holiday periods, unforeseen technical issues etc.. Inasmuch as possible, we will notify you if we encounter any of the above-mentioned situations as soon as they are communicated to us by the fast courier company.

After the Order is received, it is recommended to check the products for any physical defects caused by transport. It is also recommended to check the product in terms of the specifications and the accessories with which it is delivered.

Delivery costs shall be covered by MEZE AUDIO if the value of the Order is at least RON 5,000 or EUR 1,000 or USD 1,000, depending on the reference currency. For Orders having a lower value, the Customer shall pay the equivalent value of the transport, displayed on the Website upon placing the Order.

#### 6\. PRODUCT WARRANTY

All products marketed by the online store MEZE AUDIO shall have warranty conditions in accordance with the law in force and with the commercial conditions of manufacturers and distributors. All products are new, in original packaging.

Warranty conditions are in accordance with the provisions of Government Emergency Order 140/2021 and Government Order 21/1992, as further amended. Any repair or replacement of the products shall be carried out within a reasonable period of time, which cannot, however, exceed 15 calendar days.

The consumer is defined as follows: “any natural person or group of natural persons set up in associations who, as part of the contracts covered by this law, act for purposes outside its commercial, industrial or manufacturing, handcrafting, or liberal activity.” Legal persons are not covered by the two above-mentioned laws.

Legal person Buyers shall not be granted the rights specific for natural person consumers, as the notion of consumer is defined in the law on consumer protection.

#### 7\. PRODUCT RETURNS

Natural person consumers shall have the right to withdraw from the Contract, respectively to return a Good or to renounce a Service, within 14 calendar days, without claiming any reasons and without covering any costs other than the delivery costs. Thus, according to Government Emergency Order No 34/2014, the period for returning a Good or for renouncing a Service shall expire within 14 days from the date on which the Buyer takes physical possession of the Good ordered.

If the Customer decides to withdraw from the Contract, they can submit a request to the Seller in this regard. In accordance with Article 11 of Government Emergency Order 34/2014, before expiry of the withdrawal period, the consumer shall inform the professional regarding their decision to withdraw from the Contract. For this purpose, the consumer shall send to the Seller their decision to withdraw from the Contract via an email sent to the address sent to the address included in the contact section.

If the Buyer requests a withdrawal from the Contract within the legal term for withdrawal from the Contract, they shall also return any potential gifts accompanying the respective product. If the Order is paid, the Seller shall reimburse the amount within a maximum of 14 (fourteen) days from the date on which the Buyer informs the Seller on their decision to withdraw from the Contract. The amount shall be returned by refund into the account from which the payment was made or into the bank account indicated by the Customer, if the payment was not made by bank card.

Reimbursement of the amount due to the Customer shall only be decided after the goods sold are received from the Customer, to allow for their assessment. The Seller may postpone the reimbursement of the product’s equivalent value until receipt of the product sold or until receipt of a proof of dispatch.

The following shall be exempted from the right of withdrawal:

1. the performance or the access to a service, after providing access or the service, if the performance started with the Buyer’s express consent;
2. the supply of Goods manufactured/ordered according to the specifications submitted by the Buyer or clearly customized (Orders for which a 10% nonrefundable advance payment is charged);
3. consumable products which were unsealed and which started being used;

If the marketed products are bespoke products, corresponding to the Customer’s requirements, at the request of the Customer (Registered User), they shall not be assigned the right to return, respectively the right to withdraw from the Contract, an exception regulated by the provisions of Article 16 of Government Emergency Order No 34/2014.

In case of a return, the products shall be returned in their original packaging, with all accessories and labels intact, as well as with all documents accompanying them and a copy of the purchasing Invoice. Any products returned without their packaging or without accessories of the packaging (for instance safety props, cardboard or polystyrene protective elements etc.) or of the product shall lead to a reduction in the value of the products.

Returns shall not be accepted for products with physical changes, damaging, chipping, scratching, staining, shocks etc.

The Customer shall only be responsible for the reduction in the value of the goods resulting from handling other than that required to determine the nature, the capacities, and the operation of the goods.

The handling accepted to determine the nature, the quality, and the functioning of the goods are:

* unpackaging without destroying or damaging the original packaging, observing the unpacking instructions (where the manufacturer indicates the handling manner) without damaging the packaging, the product or the accessories;
* the visual, tacit inspection of products;
* in the case of products which do not require the installation of consumable accessories or the connection to utilities other than electricity, only electricity supply and turning them on/off shall be allowed;
* in the case of products which require the installation of consumable accessories (e.g.: filters, cartridges etc.) or the connection to utilities other than electricity (e.g.: water, gas etc.), only electricity supply shall be allowed and the installation of consumable accessories shall not be allowed.

If a consumer exerts the right of withdrawal after using the goods to an extent exceeding the limit needed to establish the nature, the characteristics, and the operation of the goods, the consumer shall be liable for any potential reduction in the value of the goods.

Unaccepted actions leading to a reduction in the value of the returned product or to the loss of the right of withdrawal:

* use of electronic devices or of household appliances in any way other than testing by turning the device on/off;
* breaking of seals and labels;
* breaking or damaging the packaging;
* scratching, smearing, staining, impregnating the products with external substances.

The accessories (user manuals, CDs, cables etc.) found in the product box, as well as its original packaging, are an integral part of the product. Consequently, when you return a product, you are under the obligation to return it with the original packaging undamaged, protected by foil wrapping or packaged in cardboard boxes, together with all its accessories.

Any change in the condition of the products or damaging to their original packaging, which renders impossible the sale of the product as new, shall automatically lead to the application of the return procedure subject to rates incurred for bringing the products back into the state in which they were delivered. The reduction shall be applied between 10 and 90% of the product’s initial value. The reduction rate shall be communicated to the Customer upon receiving the amended products.
