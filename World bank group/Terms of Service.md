**Terms of Use for the World Bank Group Archives Photo Catalog** 

**Description**

The World Bank Group supports the free online communication and exchange of knowledge as the most effective way of ensuring that the fruits of research, economic and sector work, and development practice are made widely available, read, and built upon. The World Bank Group is committed to open access, which, consistent with the access to information policies of the World Bank Group’s member institutions \*, enables the widest possible dissemination of their findings and, for researchers, readers, and users, increases their ability to discover pertinent information.

To learn more about the World Bank Group Archives Photo Catalog (hereinafter Archives Photo Catalog) please visit [Who We Are page](https://archivesphotos.worldbank.org/en/about/archives/photo-gallery).

**Intellectual Property Rights - Licenses**

You are encouraged to use the Archives Photo Catalog to benefit yourself and others in creative ways. By using this website and any of the materials made available through the Archives Photo Catalog (the “Still Images”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.

You are permitted to use the Still Images, subject to your compliance with certain license terms, but The World Bank still retains the copyright to all of the Still Images in the Archives Photo Catalog, unless specifically noted to the contrary.

The majority of Still Images in the Archives Photo Catalog are licensed under the following public license: the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike 4.0 ([CC BY NC-SA. 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)).

When you download or use the Still Images, you are agreeing to comply with the terms of a CC BY NC-SA 4.0 license, and also agreeing to the following mandatory and binding addition: 

Any and all disputes arising under this License that cannot be settled amicably shall be resolved in accordance with the following procedure:

Any and all disputes arising under this License that cannot be settled amicably shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with the WIPO Mediation Rules. If the request for mediation is not resolved within thirty (30) days of the request, either You or the Licensor may, pursuant to a notice of arbitration communicated by reasonable means to the other, refer the dispute to final and binding arbitration to be conducted in accordance with UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as then in force. The arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator and the language of the proceedings shall be English unless otherwise agreed. The place of arbitration shall be where the Licensor has its headquarters. The arbitral proceedings shall be conducted remotely (e.g., via telephone conference or written submissions) whenever practicable or held at the World Bank headquarters in Washington DC.

Some Still Images within the Archives Photo Catalog are not subject to the CC BY NC-SA 4.0 license, but are available under other license terms.

**Third Party Content**

The World Bank does not necessarily own each Still Image included in the Archives Photo Catalog. The World Bank therefore does not warrant that the use of any third-party-owned Still Image contained in the Archives Photo Catalog will not infringe on the rights of third parties. The risk of claims resulting from such infringement rests solely with you. If you wish to re-use a Still Image from the Archives Photo Catalog, it is your responsibility to determine whether permission is needed for that re-use and to obtain permission from the copyright owner.

**Attribution**

Regardless of any other license terms governing the use of a Still Image, any use of the Still Images must be attributed to The World Bank and its content providers with a copyright notice in the following format:

\[Photographer name\]/\[World Bank\]. \[OKR handle URI\] License: \[License\*\]

\*Usually “CC BY NC-SA. 4.0”. Example:

Edwin Huffman/World Bank. License: CC BY NC-SA 4.0

This example reflects minimum attribution requirements. For academic citation purposes, more complete attribution can be given in compliance with standard academic practices.

**No Commercial Use**

You may not use the Photographs for commercial purposes.

**Adaptations of World Bank Works**

If you use a Still Image from the Archives Photo Catalog under CC BY NC-SA 4.0 or any other license that permits you to make adaptations, you must add (after the attribution language) the following explanation to the adaptation that you create:

“This is an adaptation of an original Still Image by The World Bank. Responsibility for adaptation rests solely with the creator of the adaptation and are not endorsed by The World Bank.”

**No Endorsement**

You may not publicly represent or imply that The World Bank is participating in, or has sponsored, approved or endorsed the manner or purpose of your use, reproduction or adaptation of Still Images from the World Bank. The World Bank reserves all rights to enforce its rights with respect to any use of its Still Images in a manner that falsifies, misrepresents, disparages or fraudulently uses the Still Images, infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, or disparages or harms the reputation of The World Bank.

**No Association, No Use of The World Bank or The World Bank Group Logo and Name**

You may not use any trademark, official mark, official emblem, or logo of The World Bank, The World Bank Group or any of its member institutions, or any of its other means of promotion or publicity, without the World Bank Group's prior written consent or in any event to represent or imply an association or affiliation with the World Bank Group.

**Other**

These Terms of Use may be amended by The World Bank from time to time at our sole discretion. Upon amendment, we will place a notice on https://archivesphotos.worldbank.org/en/about/archives/photo-gallery/terms-of-use. Please periodically review the controlling version of these Terms of Use. By continuing to use the Archives Photo Catalog subsequent to the World Bank making available an amended version of these Terms of Use, you acknowledge, agree and consent to such amendment.

The World Bank Group offers other websites, services and databases that are governed by different terms of use, as stated in the terms and conditions specific to such websites, services and databases. Please review the applicable terms of use before using any websites, services and databases provided or made available by the World Bank Group. Please note that failure to comply with these Terms of Use, or with the license terms applicable to any Still Image, including proper attribution format or retaining copyright notices as required, may be grounds for The World Bank Group to restrict or prohibit your access to the Archives Photo Catalog. In addition, The World Bank Group reserves all rights and legal remedies for those violations.

No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended, entered, or created by these Terms of Use.

Nothing herein shall constitute or be considered to be a limitation upon or waiver of the privileges and immunities of any member institution of the World Bank Group, all of which are specifically reserved. Any dispute between the World Bank Group and you arising out of, or in connection with, the Archives Photo Catalog, the Still Images, or your use of the Archives Photo Catalog which cannot be amicably settled between the parties to such dispute shall be arbitrated in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as then in force. The arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator and the language of the proceedings shall be English. The arbitration shall take place in the District of Columbia. The arbitral proceedings shall be conducted remotely (e.g., via telephone conference or written submissions) whenever practicable. Any resulting arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both parties.

This site is administered by the Knowledge and Information Services of the Information and Technology Solutions Department of the World Bank Group (Archives), on behalf of the member institutions of the World Bank Group. If you have questions about these Terms of Use, or about the license terms applicable to any specific Still Images in the Archives Photo Catalog, please contact us by sending an email to [archives@worldbank.org](mailto:archives@worldbank.org).
