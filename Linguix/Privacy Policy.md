### TL;DR – a note from Linguix co-founder

Hi All, this is Alex Lashkov, Linguix.com co-founder (you can see me [here](https://linguix.com/page/team)).

Before you dive into this Privacy Policy, I'd like to post a quick TLDR, so that you could get an idea of what data we collect and why we do this. Here are the most important points:

**Textly Inc. does not sell your personal data or your content** (created on Linguix.com, Turbo.linguix.com websites). You are the only owner of your content. Our users edit their novels, prepare work-related and personal projects. We do not want to lose their (yours!) trust. Our goal is to help with your writing. Period.

**We do not store your content and texts you type when using our browser extensions** **or Linguix API**. Data is sent to our servers to get checked, and vanishes forever with no option to restore it even for us. You can prevent Linguix Browser Extensions from accessing text areas at specific sites (eg. if you do not want us to check your emails, then you can disable the extension in Gmail).

However, **if you choose to store your documents in our web application (app.linguix.com), these texts will remain on our servers until you delete them**. Or you can use a Secret Mode in our web app, in such cases the texts will be deleted immediately after you leave the editor.

Our main rule: **employees do not have access to your content and transmitted data**. However, the content may be accessed by a dedicated employee if we need to do so in respond to your request for support, if we get an official order from authorities (subject to review, no such cases so far), etc.

Linguix is a freemium service, which means there are free and paid parts of the product. We hope people will buy our Premium as that's the only way we make money. So, **we will tell you about pros of using our Premium offering**.

**We use cookies** to provide better service, promote our products, and secure our users.

**A few trusted third parties** under certain circumstances **can help us to provide a better service**.

**Users can exercise their GDPR and CCPA rights.** We are open to any requests from our users (i.e. deleting accounts, personal information), as well as

If there are still questions or confusing moments, feel free to drop us a message at [\[email protected\]](https://linguix.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), and we will get back to you shortly! Or ping me directly at [\[email protected\]](https://linguix.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Now, let's move to the full version of the document.

– identifiers – name, email address or account in the specific social network, profile data;

– business data – payment transactions information;

– financial information – payment method or connected financial accounts;

– network and device activity – IP addresses used to connect to the software, usage information;

– location – where your device you are using to access Linguix website, applications, and services is located;

Also, we may aggregate such information or de-indentify it to prevent or limit the disclosure of any user or device data to other parties.

### Rights And How to Exercise Them

delete certain information we have about by your request.

Also, under the CCPA, you have a right to receive information about the financial incentives we may offer to you (if there are any). Moreover, California residents have the right not to be discriminated for exercising some of their rights. On practice this means, that if you will require us to delete the certain information we collect to provide you with access to the Site, the Software and Services, you may loose an opportunity to access the Site, Software and Services.

– If you want to send us a CCPA-related request (to get an information about your personal data we collect or request us to delete it) you may submit a support ticket via [this link](https://linguix.com/page/contacts).

We may ask you to provide sufficient information to verify your identity prior to processing your request. You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. This agent will have to provide us with written authorization from you. In this case you will need to verify your identity directly with us anyway.

The CCPA lists a list of obligations for companies that "sell" personal information. However, according to the definition of "selling" implied by the law, Linguix software (Textly Inc.) does not participate in such activity. Also, we did not participate in such activity in the last twelve months, and have to plans for doing so in the future.

That said, you must understand, that we may share certain information about you and allow third parties to collect a specific information about you, for example through cookies. We thoroughly describe all such cases in corresponding sections of this Privacy Policy.
