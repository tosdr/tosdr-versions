Cookie Statement
================

Updated: June 30, 2023

This Cookie Statement explains how Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (“Zoom”) and our third-party partners use cookies and similar technologies (“Cookies”) on our websites, including services provided on those websites (referred to collectively as “Websites”).

Zoom uses Cookies to enable basic functionality, analyze trends, understand when and how you visit and interact with Zoom’s Websites, gather information about your device and settings, and to permit Zoom and its marketing partners to provide and measure advertising to you relating to Zoom products and services. . Depending on your jurisdiction, we ask for your prior consent for different types of Cookies or allow you to opt-out.

**What are Cookies and How Does Zoom Use Them?**
------------------------------------------------

Cookies are small text, image or data files or tag code snippets placed on your device by websites that you visit or access. They are widely used to make websites work and function with greater efficiency, and to provide customization and to improve website performance. Some Cookies stay on your device only for the duration of your web session and expire when you exit your browser; other Cookies remain longer than your web session, including after you exit your browser, for example to remember you when you return to the website.

The table below explains the categories of Cookies that Zoom and our third-party partners use on our Websites and why. Depending on your jurisdiction, we get permission before we set certain cookies and you can always prevent Zoom from setting cookies that are not necessary for the performance of the Zoom service. Once you make such a cookie selection, Zoom stores a “preference” cookie on your device for at least six (6) months to prevent repeatedly asking you to set your cookie preferences. More detailed information about the specific Cookies used, and how you can control them, can be found by visiting our [Cookie management tool](https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/) at the footer of the page.

Cookie

Type

Purpose

Strictly Necessary Cookies \[1\]

Core

These Cookies are required to enable basic Website functionality such as providing a secure login and remembering your progress through an order. For example when you sign into a Website using your Zoom account, we store the time you signed in and a unique ID number in an encrypted Cookie on your device. This Cookie allows you to move from page to page within the Website without signing in again on each page.

Technical Performance

Zoom uses these Cookies for, among other things, detection of browsing issues, optimization of technical performance and ergonomics, estimation of the required server power, the proper presentation of the Website and load balancing as strictly necessary to ensure that our Websites remain up and operating.

Necessary Settings

Zoom uses these Cookies to record a user’s settings, such as language, currency, timezone, browser, device (such as camera) and multimedia player settings, that are strictly necessary to enable our Websites to operate properly. For example, Zoom records the user’s timezone setting so that the meeting times on their calendar and calendar invites are correctly applied for them and their invitees.

Functional Cookies

Enhanced Functionality and Customization

These Cookies are not core to the service provided or the purpose of the web page visited. Functional Cookies enable the Website to provide enhanced functionality and customization, such as showing you video clips with support explanations or remembering a user’s preferences.

These Cookies may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these Cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. For example, we embed videos from Zoom's YouTube channel using YouTube’s privacy-enhanced mode to show you content. Youtube may also set additional cookies on your device once you click on the YouTube video player. If you opt-out of Functional Cookies, we will not be able to provide you with these additional functions.

Performance Cookies

Analytics

To provide and improve the performance of our Websites and products , Zoom uses Cookies, including session recording and replay technology, to gather usage and performance data (including mouse movements, clicks and other actions). For example, we use Cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a Website or to our blog and to develop other statistics about the operations of our Websites. This includes Cookies from Zoom and from third-party analytics providers, who help Zoom understand how people are using and interacting with Zoom’s Websites.

Targeting

Advertising

Zoom and Zoom’s advertising partners may set Cookies on Zoom’s Websites that collect data about how you interact with Zoom’s Website so that they can provide advertising for Zoom on other websites and apps. Zoom’s advertising partners also may set Cookies to show you third-party advertising (including personalized advertising) on Zoom’s products. Depending on your jurisdiction, the default setting for cookies differs. We ask you for your prior consent or enable you to opt out of having your information shared with third-party advertisers or from receiving personalized advertising from our third-party partners. Users who withdraw their consent or opt-out of third-party advertising Cookies won’t receive third-party personalized advertising on Zoom’s Websites or in our products.

Social Media Cookies

Some of our Websites include Cookies provided by social media companies so that you can easily share Zoom content on social media, if you are logged into your social media account. Social media companies will not be able to determine whether you are already logged into a given social media account if you turn off Targeting Cookies, so you may not be able to share Zoom content on your social media account.

\[1\] In instances where Zoom engages a third-party to deploy Strictly Necessary Cookies, Zoom only engages parties that have signed a processor agreement with Zoom in which any processing beyond or outside of Zoom’s instruction is explicitly prohibited, including by the third parties’ subprocessors. Some Strictly Necessary Cookies may transfer personal data to the United States.

**How to Control Cookies**
--------------------------

Except for Strictly Necessary Cookies, you can accept or decline categories or individual cookies at any time by visiting our [Cookie management](https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/) tool at the footer of this webpage. 

You can also control Cookies by adjusting the settings within your internet browser. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies but all browsers provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in most modern browsers, you can block or delete Cookies by clicking Settings > Privacy > Cookies. Instructions for blocking or deleting Cookies in other browsers may be available in each browser’s privacy or help documentation.
