Cookie policy
=============

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Audioboom platform, which is owned and operated by Audioboom Limited. Here we explain what cookies may be set when you visit the platform and how to reject or delete those cookies. By continuing to use this platform, you are agreeing to our use of cookies in the way described in this policy.

What are cookies?
-----------------

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your computer or other device to allow a platform to recognise you as a user when you return using the same device and web browser, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (a ‘persistent cookie’). Other similar files work in the same way and we use the word ‘cookie’ to refer to all files that collect information in this way. For example, a cookie is used to identify which country you are visiting from, and prioritizes content that will be more relevant to you. If you continue to use the platform, more cookies and other tracking technologies will be placed on your device as described in this Cookie Policy. They help to enhance your user experience.

How do I control and delete cookies?
------------------------------------

We won’t use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. However, if you want to restrict or block the cookies which are set by this platform you can do it through your browser settings. The ‘Help’ function within your browser should tell you how. You can also disable cookies by following the instructions provided in the section titled ‘Opting Out’ in each of the tables below. Alternatively, you can visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) which gives detailed information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers, as well as more general information about cookies. Restricting cookies may mean that you will not be able to take full advantage of all the features or services available on this platform.

Email tracking

Some of our emails may include a ‘web beacon pixel’ or tracked links. These allow us to identify when you have opened the email and to verify which links contained in the email you have accessed. We use this information to figure out which parts of our emails are of most interest to you. You can delete the pixel by deleting the email. If you don’t want to download the pixel to your computer or other device, you can select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML. Alternatively you can unsubscribe from our mailing list by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing email we send you.

Any changes will take effect 3 days after the date of our email or the date on which we post the modified terms on the platform, whichever is the earlier. Your continued use of the platform after that period expires means that you agree to be bound by the modified policy.
