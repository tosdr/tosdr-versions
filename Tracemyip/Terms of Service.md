As TraceMyIP Customer, you will bear a full legal responsibility to the fullest extent of the applicable law and hereby release and agree to indemnify and hold harmless TraceMyIP from any and all liability that may arise from all claims, liabilities, demands, suits, causes of actions or proceedings arising from the negligent acts.
