    How We Protect You
    
    SIPC has recovered billions of dollars for investors. Our job is to recover missing cash or securities if your brokerage firm has gone out of business.
    
    SIPC has issued Investor Bulletins explaining SIPC’s protection and claims process. [Click here](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-101) for Part I ("SIPC Basics"). [Click here](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-102) for Part II ("Filing a SIPC Claim").
    
    SIPC does not protect digital asset securities that are investment contracts that are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, even if held by a SIPC member brokerage firm.
