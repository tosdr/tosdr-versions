Terms of Service

Last Revised December 20, 2013

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE RELATED PRIVACY POLICY LOCATED AT WWW.AUTISMHOUSINGNETWORK.ORG CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE OR ANY OF THE “FORUMS” (AS DEFINED BELOW).

This “Site” (as defined below) is owned and operated by Madison House Autism Foundation (“Foundation”, “us” or “we”).  These terms of service (the “Terms of Service”, “TOS” or “Agreement”) set forth the legal terms and conditions governing your use of our website located at www.autismhousingnetwork.org and any other online and mobile websites and interactive applications operated by Foundation that are related to [www.madisonhouseautism.org](https://www.madisonhouseautism.org/) (collectively, the “Site”) (unless a different policy is provided on a particular site, application or service, in which case such different policy shall govern and control).  Your use of this Site confirms your unconditional agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service and is subject to your continued compliance with these Terms of Service.  If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, you may not access or otherwise use the Site.  Before using the Site, please review the related Foundation Privacy Policy, located at [www.madisonhouseautism.org/privacy/](https://www.madisonhouseautism.org/privacy/) (the “Privacy Policy”), which is incorporated herein by this reference.

Eligibility

The Site is intended solely for users thirteen (13) years of age and older.  You represent and warrant either that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older, or if you are under the age of eighteen (18) that you are at least thirteen (13) and are accessing the Site with the knowledge and consent of your parent or legal guardian, who will also be deemed to have agreed to this Agreement.  Certain parts of the Site may be subject in whole or in part to heightened age and/or other eligibility requirements.

Registration

Certain parts or features of the Site may require registration or may otherwise ask you to provide information to participate in certain features or to access certain content.  The decision to provide this information is purely voluntary and optional; however, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content or participate in certain parts or features of the Site.  You agree that you will not provide any false personal information to the Site, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.  You will also not create more than one personal profile, and if you select a username for your account, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as if a trademark owner complains about a username).  If you register with the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, if any, and for restricting access to your computer so that others may not access the password protected portion of the Site.  You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account, email or password, if any, and agree you will not sell, transfer or assign your membership or any membership rights.  Foundation may, in its sole discretion, and at any time, with or without notice, terminate your password and membership, for any reason or no reason at all.  If we disable your account, you agree that you will not create another one without our permission.

License to the Site

Foundation grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right and license to access, use and privately display the Site and the materials thereon for your personal use only, provided that you comply fully with this TOS. You shall not interfere (or permit the use of your membership by a third party to interfere) or attempt to interfere with the operation or use of Site by other members in any way through any means or device including, but not limited to, spamming, hacking, uploading computer viruses or time bombs, or any other means expressly prohibited by any provision of this TOS.

Changes to Site and/or Terms of Service

Foundation reserves the right, from time to time, in its sole discretion, to change, modify, update, discontinue, remove, revise, delete or otherwise change any portion of the Site or this TOS, in whole or in part, at any time without further notice. For changes to these TOS that we deem material, we will place a notice on the Foundation website located at [www.madisonhouseautism.org](https://www.madisonhouseautism.org/) by revising the link on the homepage to read substantially as “Updated Terms of Service” for up to three (3) weeks or some other amount of time that we determine in our discretion.  If you access or use the Site in any way after the TOS have been changed, you will be deemed to have read, understood and unconditionally consented to and agreed to such changes.  The most current version of these TOS will be available on the site and will supersede all previous versions of these TOS.

If you send or post certain specific submissions at our request (e.g., via message boards or in connection with contests) or if you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, photographs, drawings, concepts, or any other information (each, a “Submission” and collectively, the “Submissions”) despite our request that you not send us any unsolicited Submissions or other creative materials, the Submission will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary in each instance.  For purposes of this Paragraph, all User Content shall be deemed included in the definition of Submissions.  None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Foundation, and Foundation shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Any Submission may be used by Foundation without restriction for any purpose whatsoever, including, without limitation, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast or posting, and you hereby irrevocably waive, release and give up any claim that any use of such Submission violates any of your rights, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, privacy rights, proprietary or other property rights, publicity rights, or right to credit for the material or ideas.  Foundation shall have and is hereby irrevocably granted the right, but not the obligation, to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, broadcast, license, perform, post, sell, translate, incorporate, create derivative works from, exploit, distribute and otherwise use the Submission in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the universe, in perpetuity, without according you any compensation or credit.  By submitting a Submission to the Site or Foundation, you represent that such Submission is original with you and does not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third parties, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights and rights of publicity and/or privacy.
