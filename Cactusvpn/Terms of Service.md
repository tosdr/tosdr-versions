Terms of Service
================

General
-------

www.cactusvpn.com (hereinafter called CactusVPN) provides VPN services under the name of CactusVPN. As a provider of internet services, CactusVPN offers to its clients and to their customers and users, the means to disseminate public, private, commercial, and non-commercial information.

CactusVPN respects the fact that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information. However, when there are competing interests at issue, CactusVPN reserves the right to take certain preventative or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, CactusVPN has developed these Terms Of Service, which supplement and explain certain terms of each customer’s respective service agreement. These terms are intended as a guide to the customer’s rights and obligations when utilizing CactusVPN’s services.

These terms will be revised from time to time. Customer’s use of CactusVPN’s services after changes to these terms will be posted on CactusVPN web sites and will constitute the customer’s acceptance of any new or additional terms.

One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet’s openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use the Internet to disseminate information to others.

It must be kept in mind that CactusVPN does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information its clients may create. When clients place information on the Internet, they have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech. Also, because the information they place on CactusVPN’s network may be carried to a large number of people, including both clients and non-clients of CactusVPN, clients’ postings to the Internet may affect other clients and may harm CactusVPN’s goodwill, business reputation, and operations.

Fair Usage and Limitations
--------------------------

**For personal use**, you can use an unlimited number of devices simultaneously with one subscription. However, to keep a great service for all our clients we have to specify that this feature is only limited to one household. Therefore it is prohibited to share your account with anyone outside your household. In case we find that our client shared his account with someone outside his household, we reserve the right to close his account permanently.

Because of technical limitations, with some protocols (PPTP, L2TP, IKEv2 and WireGuard), the limit is one connection per subscription per VPN server. To avoid this limitation the user just has to use the OpenVPN, SSTP or SoftEther VPN protocol or to connect each device to a different VPN server if he needs to use them simultaneously.

**For our business clients**, the number of devices simultaneously connected to CactusVPN per subscription is limited to one. This means that you will need a subscription for each employer that uses our services.

We offer unlimited traffic to our users. However, to keep a great service for all our clients we have to specify that if a client uses a very high amount of resources and this worsens the experience of other users, we reserve the right to permanently close the client’s account. This will only affect users with very high traffic usage that try to exploit our services.
