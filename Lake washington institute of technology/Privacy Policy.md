Thank you for visiting the Lake Washington Institute of Technology (LWTech) website and reviewing our privacy policy. This statement addresses collection, use, security of, and access to information that may be obtained through use of LWTech's website. This policy covers the following topics:

Information Collected & How It Is Used
--------------------------------------

Information Collected If You Only Browse The Website
----------------------------------------------------

If you do nothing during your visit to our website but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

* Internet protocol (IP) address and domain name used. The IP address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the IP address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider.
* Type of browser and operating system you used
* Date and time you visited this site
* Webpages or services you accessed at this site

The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by LWTech only to improve the content and usefulness of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our website.

What We Collect If You Volunteer Information
--------------------------------------------

If during your visit to our website you participate in a survey, send an email, or perform some other transaction online, the following additional information will be collected:

* Email address, and contents of email, for those who communicate with us via email
* Information volunteered in response to a survey
* Information volunteered through an online form for any other purpose

The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

We use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate action. Survey information and information from other online forms is used for official college business only.

Personal Information and Choice
-------------------------------

You may choose whether to provide personal information online. Personal information is information about a person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or IP address is not considered personal information.

We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us email, participating in a survey, or completing an online form. You may choose not to contact us by email, participate in a survey, or to provide any personal information using an online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse and read or download any information provided on the site. Alternatives such as mail, fax, or telephone are available if you so choose. Contact Lake Washington Institute of Technology by mail at 11605 132nd Ave NE, Kirkland, WA 98034 by phone at (425) 739-8100, or by fax at (425) 739-8110.

If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.

If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact Lake Washington Institute of Technology by mail at 11605 132nd Ave NE, Kirkland, WA 98034 by phone at (425) 739-8100, or by fax at (425) 739-8110.

The collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.

Public Access to Information
----------------------------

In the State of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.

All of the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists. Statue RCW 42.17.260(1) states that:

Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section \[RCW 42.17.260(6)\], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.

In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public Records Act or other law governing the agency's disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.
