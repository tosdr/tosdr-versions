### Use of the LEO website through a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, EDGE, Vivaldi, etc.) without registration / user account  ­

* #### ﻿Data required for the presentation of the website  ­
    
    When a user visits the website, a series of general data and information are collected with each visit. The following data may be collected:
    
    * the IP address,
    * the timestamp. This is the day and time the website was visited,
    * the request line. This is the path of the target address without the domain.
    * the status code. These are certain code numbers that are helpful for error analysis. For example, 200 means that the page was presented without errors and 404 means that a page was not found,
    * the size of the response body. This indicates the size of the content you downloaded or viewed.
    * referer sent by the client. This indicates which page you came to our website from.
    * user agent, which was sent by the client. This is information about the type and version of the browser and operating system you are using. 
    
    The purpose of the processing is, first of all, to ensure that data can be transmitted to your terminal device at all. The use of the IP address is indispensable for this.
    
    In addition, the data are used to compile visitor statistics, to carry out error analysis, to ensure that our website is working properly at all times and, in the event of cyber attacks, to be able to analyse these and take defensive measures, as well as to involve law enforcement authorities if necessary.
    
    The legal basis for the processing measures is Art. 6. para. 1. Sent.1 (f) GDPR, a legitimate interest, namely to enable you to visit the website, to compile visitor statistics in order to make the website more user-friendly, to analyse errors, to ensure the website is working properly and to defend ourselves against cyber attacks.  
    It is only the IP address which has a direct personal reference. The other data only becomes personal data in connection with the IP address. The IP address is stored for a maximum of seven days and then deleted or anonymised.
    
    For the content at https://blog.leo.org we use HostPress GmbH, Bahnhofstraße 34, 66571 Eppelborn, Germany, as the host provider. It is the recipient of the aforementioned data in the terms of data protection law. We have concluded a data-processing contract with our host provider. This means that it processes personal data exclusively on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions on the basis of a legally prescribed contract in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.  ­
    
    All other services and content under the domain leo.org are hosted by ourselves.
    
    We may use so-called Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and engage order processors for this purpose. Such CDNs serve a legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6, para. 1, sent.1 (f). GDPR to increase the security and the delivery speed of our website to visitors by optimising the delivery of the contents of our website from servers distributed worldwide. In this context, personal data may be processed in server log files by the CDN. Your personal data will be stored for as long as is necessary for the purposes described. We currently use the services of Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich Germany (Cloudflare).
    
    In the context of the use of Cloudflare, there may be a transfer of data to countries, in particular to the USA, where there is no valid adequacy decision of the European Commission. In this regard, the appropriate safeguards according to Art. 46 GDPR consist of the standard data protection clauses of the European Commission, which are included in our contract with Cloudflare and which can be viewed at https://www.cloudflare.com/de-de/cloudflare-customer-dpa/.
    
* #### Cookies  ­
    
    On our website we use so-called cookies and similar technologies to enable visitors to use certain functions and thus make visiting our website more attractive. Cookies are small text files that are automatically stored on the user’s terminal device.
    
    Some of the cookies we use are deleted at the end of the browser session, i.e. after you close your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your end device (persistent cookies). They enable us to recognise your browser on your next visit.

Registration / User account at LEO
----------------------------------

When you create a free user account with LEO, for example in order to write contributions for the forums, to buy a language course or to use the Trainer for your personal vocabulary training, the following data are collected and stored upon registration:

* User name: can be freely chosen, is not visible to other users
* Alias (nick name): can be freely chosen, is possibly visible to other users (e.g. if you write a contribution for the forum)
* Email address: is used for the confirmation (verification) of the log in. Is only visible to other users if you give your explicit consent and the appropriate settings are made in your account. You can change your email address in your account settings at any time. The email address provided upon initial registration remains stored in unchanged form. We do not give your email address to third parties and we do not send newsletters.
* LEO messages (“Private messages”): stores your wish to receive or not to receive personal messages from other users within LEO. You can change this wish at any time by adjusting your account settings. The private messages are stored permanently on our servers. Your email address is not visible to other users of the private messages facility/service. ­

We do not forward the data collected upon registration to third parties.  
 ­

Upon creation of a user account, the standard settings for the Trainer are automatically linked to the user account; in this process the following data are stored:

* Test volume: lays down how many vocabulary items you normally want to be tested on per questioning session.
* Test direction: lays down which language is to be given and which is to be tested.
* Strictness: lays down how strictly the checking of the answer you provide is to be evaluated (e.g. in the testing method "write").
* Vocabulary items automatically deleted: lays down in two ways whether the vocabulary item should be removed from the collection, either on the basis of absolute values (“known X times in succession”) or on the basis of a percentual value (“tested at least Z times and known in Y% of the cases”) or on the basis of a combination of these two variants.

You can change these settings before each testing session or permanently in your user account. These data are not visible to third parties.  
 ­

In your user account you can provide additional details of your own free will: family name, first name, address (street, town, postcode, region, country), occupation, language-related information (free text), knowledge of the individual languages (level, region, native language) offered by LEO. Language-related details and knowledge of languages (to the extent that these are provided) are always visible to the public; the other details voluntarily provided can be made visible to others or not, as you wish.  
 ­

We store the date of your registration and the most recent log in to LEO.  
 ­

### Storage duration  ­

The user-account data remain stored for the purpose of the existing user account for the duration of your registration with LEO, i.e. until you delete your user account or we terminate it.

The data are still available in a backup for up to 7 days after deletion and are then finally deleted. The legal basis for this storage in the backup is a legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6, para.1, sent. 1(f) GDPR, as well as a legal obligation in accordance with Art. 6, para. 1, sent. 1 (c) GDPR, namely to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of our systems and services in connection with long term processing in accordance with Art. 32, para. 1 (b) GDPR.

Use of the forums  ­
--------------------

With regard to the use of LEO’s forums, data are not stored until you start to take an active part in the forum activities, e.g. when you start a new thread by writing a question or you respond to another user's question (“contribution”). If you only read the contributions in the forums, no data about you is stored. ­

Every user who makes a contribution to one of our forums, gives his or her irrevocable consent to the permanent publication of this contribution in the forum concerned. The user, however, has no entitlement vis-à-vis LEO to have his or her contributions published in a forum.  
 ­

When you write a contribution for a forum, the IP address assigned to your internet connection at that time is stored. The IP address is stored for a maximum of 29 days and is only forwarded to the authorities concerned if the authorities are prosecuting an offence.  
These data are stored and/or processed in accordance with Article 6, para. 1, sent. (b) of the GDPR.

Contributions you make to the forums appear exclusively under your alias; other forum users are thus unable to connect these to your person. The deletion of your account removes all your personal data, but this does not include contributions to the forum which are published anonymously and are thus not connected to your person. If these contributions were to be removed, it would have a distorting effect on the forum discussions and would deprive the contributions made by other users, or their comments on your contribution, of their sense and context.  
These data are stored and/or processed in accordance with Article 6, para. 1, sent. (b) of the GDPR. This legal provision permits the processing of personal data by the controller (in this case LEO) when there is a “legitimate interest” which does not come into conflict with a user’s overriding interests. Our legitimate interest consists in the financing of the operation of our websites and apps. Both of these contain extensively researched information which we provide to a large extent free of charge. The marketing of the advertising spaces on our pages enables us to continue to offer these website and app services and to make them available to everyone in this form and, in this way, to make a significant contribution to the dissemination of knowledge.

When you "subscribe" to a contribution in a forum in order to be notified about new responses, we store the following data in your user account:

* the discussion in question
* the mode in which you wish to be notified (only on the LEO page or by email)
* whether you have read the discussion since the last notification was sent

 ­

Use of the Trainer  ­
---------------------

When you use the Trainer, the following data are stored (depending on the way it is used):

* Your collection of vocabulary items  
     ­
* The testing statistics of all vocabulary items on which you test yourself regardless of whether these are vocabulary items from your own collection or from word lists prepared by LEO or from the word lists of other users. The testing statistics contain:
    
    * how often you have successfully practised a vocabulary item
    * how often you have not successfully practised a vocabulary item
    * how often in succession you have successfully or not successfully practised vocabulary item
    * when you last practised a vocabulary item
    
      
     ­
* If you compose word lists, these word lists are linked to your user account and the assignment of your vocabulary items to your word lists is stored.  
     ­
* If you compose folders, the folders are linked to your user account and the assignment of word lists to folders and folders to folders is stored.  
     ­
* If you initiate a learning group, the group is linked to your user account.  
     ­

### Use of groups in the Trainer  ­

If you initiate a learning group or are a participant in such a learning group, other users can possibly learn your word lists. You can decide for yourself which of your folders or word lists you want to share with other group members. By releasing a word list or a folder, or any number of them, you give LEO permission to make all these items available to other group members.  
 ­

### Automatic evaluation of learning progress  ­

In order to offer you appropriate vocabulary items for you to practise and learn whenever you decide to use the Trainer, your earlier vocabulary-learning successes are analysed by our system. This analysis determines a number of vocabulary items and proposes these to you for practice.  
 ­

Reporting mistakes  ­
---------------------

When you use our prescribed form for submitting details about ­ [content errors  ­](https://dict.leo.org/pages/collaboration/ende/reportError_en.html)  [technical problems  ­](https://dict.leo.org/pages/help/ende/reportProblem_en.html), the data you provide in the form is stored for only as long as we need to process your submission and to remedy the problem. After your submission has been dealt with, the data are automatically deleted. If you wish, you can also have the data deleted earlier by sending us a written request to this effect by email.  
The legal basis for the use of these data is an existing legitimate interest, namely in possible troubleshooting and error correction, in accordance with Art. 6, para. 1, sent. 1(f) GDPR.

Emails to LEO  ­
----------------

If you write emails to the LEO Team or individual staff members, these emails will be stored permanently. Your messages will only be used to resolve your concern as quickly as possible. We store your e-mails In order to be able to provide better answers to any follow-up questions at a later time on a different or the same concern,. We do not send newsletters and do not pass on your e-mail address to third parties.  
These data are stored and/or processed in accordance with Art. 6, Para. 1, Sentence 1(f) GDPR. This authorisation allows the processing of personal data if there is a "legitimate interest" pursued by the controller and a user has no opposing and overriding interests. Our legitimate interest is to optimise the processes we have in place to respond to enquiries.
