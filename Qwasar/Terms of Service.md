Miscellaneous
-------------

### Governing Law and Forum choice

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Qwasar are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Alameda County, and you and Qwasar each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

### Dispute Resolution

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND QWASAR THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING THE PROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION).

### Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes

We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Qwasar agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Qwasar are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

### Notice of Dispute

In the event of a Dispute, you or Qwasar must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution. You must send any Notice of Dispute via e-mail legal-TC@qwasar.io. Qwasar will send you a Notice to your email address. You and Qwasar will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice is sent, before either party may commence arbitration.

### Exceptions and Opt-out

As limited exceptions to the above: (i) you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. In addition, you will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at legal-TC@qwasar.io within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms.

### Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.

The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.

If your claim is for U.S. $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

### Class Action Waiver

YOU AND QWASAR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section “Changes to Terms or Services” above, if Qwasar changes any of the terms of this Section “Dispute Resolution” after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to legal-TC@qwasar.io) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Qwasar’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Qwasar in accordance with the terms of this Section “Dispute Resolution” as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions related to the "Class Action Waiver", if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

### Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Qwasar and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Qwasar and you regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Qwasar’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Qwasar may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

### Waiver of Rights

Qwasar’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Qwasar. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
