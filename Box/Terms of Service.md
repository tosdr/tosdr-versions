Box Terms of Service
====================

Effective as of July 1, 2023

Welcome to Box! 
----------------

Box is a cloud-based content management platform. Our products make it easier for people to share ideas, collaborate and help get work done. Since our products are cloud based, you can access them through the web and through any number of device types (e.g., desktop, laptop, tablets, and smartphone devices) that you choose. 

This document, the Box Terms of Service ("**Terms**"), outlines the terms regarding your use of our products.  These Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Box so please read carefully. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not register or use any of the Services.

By using, accessing or browsing the Box Service, platform and products including applications, mobile, software, websites or other properties owned or operated by Box or by registering for a Box account ( "**Services**") you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms for the Services provided by Box ("**Box**" or "**we**"). If you reside in the United States, you are entering into this contract with Box, Inc. If you reside outside of the United States excluding Japan, you are entering into this contract with Box.com (UK) Ltd., a company registered in England and Wales (company number 0809736), VAT number GB177912768. If you reside in Japan, you are entering into this contract with K.K. Box Japan, a company registered in Japan (company number 0104-01-107327). 

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Box that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, "**you**" and "**your**" will refer to that organization) unless that organization has a separate paid contract in effect with us, in which event the terms of that contract will govern your use of the Services. 

In order to use the Service, you must be legally permitted to accept these Terms.

1\. PRIVACY
-----------

In order to operate and provide the Services, we collect certain information about you. We use and protect that information as described in our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.box.com/legal/privacypolicy). You acknowledge your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy and understand that it identifies how Box collects, stores, and uses certain information.

2\. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS
--------------------------

We reserve the right to modify these Terms. We will post the most current version of these Terms at [**www.box.com**](https://www.box.com/home) (the "**Site**"). If we make material changes to these Terms, we will notify you via the Services and/or by email to the address associated with your account. If you do not accept the changes, you must stop using and cancel your account by emailing [**cancel@box.com**](mailto:cancel@box.com). Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these Terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms.

3\. YOUR ACCOUNT
----------------

Certain aspects of the Services may require you to obtain an account by completing a registration form and designating a user ID and password. When registering with Box you must: (a) provide true, current and complete information about yourself on the registration form and (b) maintain such information so it continues to be true, current and complete.

You are entirely responsible for all materials and information that you upload, post or otherwise transmit via the Services (please also see our Acceptable Use Policy in Section 10). If your account includes an administrative console, that console may include options to configure your use of some of the features in the Box Services.

If you choose to use Box Sign, the electronic signing feature Box may make available to you as part of the Box Services ("**Box Sign**"), it is your responsibility to determine whether the features of Box Sign are appropriate for your particular use cases and the laws and regulations that apply to you and the signers of your documents. Box does not commit to maintaining copies of signed agreements or signature logs separately from the files created during the Box Sign process. You have the sole responsibility to ensure these files are maintained appropriately.

If you use Box Sign, it will present this [default disclosure](https://www.box.com/legal/electronic-record-and-signature-disclosure) to each recipient of your Box Sign requests on your behalf unless you have an administrative console and have changed the disclosure settings in that console. By using Box Sign to send files for signature without changing the default disclosure settings, you are adopting this disclosure each time as terms that will govern your Box Sign transaction. Similarly if you customize the disclosure in your administrative console, the customized terms you create will be presented to each recipient of your Box Sign requests and will govern each of your Box Sign transactions.

Only you may use your Box account and you are responsible for all aspects of your account. Each user must have a separate account. You may not share, loan or transfer your ID or password. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of the Services or your account, or have any questions about your account please contact Box Support via our [**Box Community Page**](https://community.box.com/).

4\. EMAIL SELECTED FOR YOUR ACCOUNT
-----------------------------------

You get to choose what email address(es) you register for an account. Please be aware, however, that if the domain of the email address associated with your account is owned or controlled by an organization (such as your work or school) and that organization establishes a direct relationship with us and wishes to add your account to such relationship, then you may be rolled into that organization’s account after a reasonable attempt to notify you of the change. Fourteen (14) days after that attempted notice, if you do not respond or change the email address associated with your account, your account may be deactivated, and Content associated with your account may be deleted.

If an organization provided you with your account (e.g., an employer or school), or if you agree to have your account managed by an organization, you understand that this organization has rights to your account and may: (a) manage your account (including suspending or canceling); (b) reset your password; (c) view your usage and profile data, including how and when your account is used; and (d) manage the Content in your account.

5\. CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND SOLICITATION

6\. CONTENT
-----------

We call all the electronic documents that you upload and store on your account "**Content**". All Content uploaded by you into your account is yours! We don't control, verify, or endorse the Content that you or others put on the Services. You are responsible for: (a) all Content in your Box account(s) and that you share through the Services- and (b) making sure that you have all the rights you need in relation to the Content. In addition, by storing, using or transmitting Content you confirm that you will not violate any law or these Terms (please also see the Acceptable Use Policy in Section 10).

If you believe there has been a violation of your intellectual property rights, please complete our [**copyright compliant form**](https://cloud.app.box.com/copyright); which can also be found here: [**https://cloud.app.box.com/copyright**](https://cloud.app.box.com/copyright).

8\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
----------------------------

During your use of the Services, Box may share with you information that is confidential, sensitive or should be kept secret. For example, if we tell you about our product roadmaps, product designs and architecture, technology and technical information, provide you with security audit reviews, business and marketing plans, or share with you our business processes, these should always be considered confidential to Box. 

Similarly, we agree that your Content, credit card/banking information and information contained in your account is confidential to you. 

Also, if either of us provide any documents to the other that are labeled "confidential" (or something similar), or provide information (either in writing or verbal) that is of a type that a reasonable person should understand to be confidential such information is to be treated as confidential information.

However, if you tell us information that: (a) we already know at the time you tell us; (b) was told to us by a third party who had the right to tell us; (c) is generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by us without using any of your confidential information, then that information will not be considered confidential.  The same goes for information that we tell you that falls into any of these categories.

Lastly, we both agree that: (i) we will treat each other’s information with the same degree of care that we treat our own confidential information; (ii) will use each other’s confidential information only in connection with these Terms and the Services; (iii) only share the information with others who have a need to know and who have agreed in writing to treat it as confidential (as we’ve outlined in this section); and (iv) not share the information with any third party except as allowed in these Terms or through the Services. Of course, confidential information will always remain the property of its owner.

9\. CONTENT STORAGE
-------------------

The Services are provided from the United States. By using and accessing the Services, you understand and agree to the storage of Content and any other personal information in the United States. However, you understand that you (or other people that you collaborate with) can access the Services (including Content) from outside of the United States (subject to applicable law) and that nothing prohibits the processing of other information outside of the United States. Box does offer products that enable storage and/or processing of Content outside of the United States and those products are subject to the Box Zones specific terms in Section 26.

10\. ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY
--------------------------

You agree you will not, nor will you encourage others or assist others to, harm the Services or use the Services to harm others.

As part of our efforts to protect the Service, protect our customers, or to stop you from breaching these Terms we retain the right to block or otherwise prevent delivery of any type of file, email or other communication to or from the Services.

We also reserve the right to deactivate, change and/or require you to change your Box user ID and any custom or vanity URLs, custom links, or vanity domains you may obtain through the Services. You also agree that if you learn of any unauthorized or unacceptable use of any account, Content or the Service, you will promptly contact Box Support and take all reasonable steps to cooperate with Box and assist in the termination of such use.

11\. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE
----------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time in our sole discretion or disable any Content if a) you are in breach of these Terms; or b) your use of the Services could cause a risk of harm or loss to Box or our other users; or c) Box declines to renew your Subscription Period. When reasonable and as permitted by law, Box will provide you reasonable advance notice of this change as well as an opportunity to correct any actions that led to Box’s decision. We will not be able to provide this advance notice if you are in material breach of these Terms, or if such notice would lead to civil or criminal liability for Box, or if providing notice would compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users.

Similarly, we agree that your Content, credit card/banking information and information contained in your account is confidential to you. 

Also, if either of us provide any documents to the other that are labeled “confidential” (or something similar), or provide information (either in writing or verbal) that is of a type that a reasonable person should understand to be confidential such information is to be treated as confidential information.

However, if you tell us information that:  (a) we already know at the time you tell us; (b) was told to us by a third party who had the right to tell us; (c) is generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by us without using any of your confidential information, then that information will not be considered confidential.  The same goes for information that we tell you that falls into any of these categories.

The subscription period for the Annual Subscription Plan will be for one year and will automatically renew (without the need to go through the Services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional periods equal to one (1) year each year on the anniversary unless you cancel at least three (3) business days prior to your renewal date.

If you are on a trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your trial. If you do not wish to incur charges, you must cancel the account by the end of the 14th day.

If you do not cancel your account and we have told you the account will be converted to a paid subscription at the end of the trial period, then you authorize us to charge your credit card for that specific Service. You may, however, cancel your subscription before the next billing cycle in accordance with these Terms, but no credits or refunds will be available.

20\. FEES
---------

Box offers both free and paid Services.  If you choose to subscribe to a paid Service, you agree to pay the fees ("**Fees**") as quoted to you when you purchase that Service.  We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase. You are responsible for all charges related to using the purchased Service (for example, data charges and currency exchange settlements).  You will pay the Fees in the currency Box quoted at the time of purchase.  Box reserves the right to change the eligible currencies at any time, except where not permitted by applicable law.

Box reserves the right to change its prices at any time, however, if we have offered a specific duration and Fee for your use of the Service, we agree that the Fee will remain in force for that duration.  After the offer period ends, your use of the Service will be charged at the then-current Fee(s).  If you don't agree to these changes, you must stop using the Service and cancel via email to [**cancel@box.com**](mailto:cancel@box.com) (with cancellation confirmation from a Box representative).  If you cancel, your Service ends at the end of your current Service period or payment period, and no refunds for previously paid services will be issued.

If you do not cancel in accordance with these Terms, the subscription for the Service will automatically renew at the then-current price and term length for the next subscription period.  We will charge your credit card on file with us on the first day of the renewal of the subscription period.

21\. BILLING/PAYMENT
--------------------

If you select a paid Service, you must provide us with current, complete, accurate and authorized payment method information (e.g. credit card information).  You authorize us to charge your provided payment method for the Services you have selected and for any paid feature(s) that you choose.  We may bill: (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) if you have elected a subscription service, on a recurring basis.  To the extent Box has not received your payment, in order to bring your account up to date, we may bill you simultaneously for both past due and current amounts.  If you do not cancel your account, we may automatically renew your Service(s) and charge you for any renewal term.  You understand that failure to pay any charges or fees may result in the suspension or cancellation of your Services.

22\. SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD
------------------------

You may elect one of the following subscription plans and billing options (please note that there might be only one of these options available depending on the Service purchased):

A monthly subscription plan **(“Monthly Subscription Plan”)**. The subscription period for the Monthly Subscription Plan will be for one month and will automatically renew (without the need to go through the Services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal order form) unless you cancel your Monthly Subscription Plan at least three (3) business days prior to the renewal date. You will be billed on or about the same day each month until such time that you cancel.

An annual subscription plan **(“Annual Subscription Plan”)**. The subscription period for the Annual Subscription Plan will be for one year and will automatically renew (without the need to go through the Services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional periods equal to one (1) year each year on the anniversary unless you cancel at least three (3) business days prior to your renewal date. You will be billed annually on or about the same day each year until such time that you cancel.  Note that under the Annual Subscription Plan you will not be permitted to cancel, reduce the number of seats, or downgrade the Box Service you have selected until the anniversary date. **Be aware that you are committing to a one-year plan; if you are not certain, we recommend choosing the Monthly Subscription Plan.**

If you select the Monthly Subscription Plan, you can switch to the Annual Subscription Plan at any time.  If you select the Annual Subscription Plan, you may not change to the Monthly Subscription Plan until the end of the one-year term of your Annual Subscription Plan.

Where required by law, you may have a legal right to cancel your subscription, pursuant to Section 20, during the prescribed timeframe of your initial subscription period. If you are entitled to this right by law, your cancellation request will be processed within three (3) business days, and you will receive a prorated refund of any unused prepaid fees.

For clarity, any API calls resulting from a Platform Application will be considered chargeable if 95% of its Monthly Platform API Calls are used by you or on your behalf.

“**Monthly Platform Bandwidth**” is the Platform Bandwidth consumed on a monthly calendar basis by or on behalf of: (a) a Platform Application User; (b) a User; or (c) a Platform Service Account, not to exceed your allotted amount.  Unless specified in an order, excluded from Monthly Platform Bandwidth is Platform Bandwidth consumed by: (i) third party software application integrations that are permitted with your use of the Service; (ii) Box provided applications (e.g., the Box Web App, Box Desktop, Box Notes, Box Capture); and (iii) Box provided services (e.g. Box Shuttle), if applicable.

"**Platform Service Account**” is a non-Box software application with a unique identifier that is created and provisioned by you and your access to Content in the Service is governed through the Platform Application.

If you exceed the Platform Use Limits, additional fees will be due and/or reasonable restrictions may be placed on your account until any such excess usage is adequately eliminated by you.

You may not co-brand any Platform Products or use any Box trademarks, logos, or other Box marks to promote and market the Platform Products without Box’s prior written consent.

You will not, and will make sure that the Platform Application does not and you will not permit use of the Platform Application:  (a) to violate these Terms; (b) to perform hidden activities without Platform Application User consent (such as downloading components or other software); (c) that may alter a Platform Application User’s system without permission from the Platform Application User; (d) impersonate, or misrepresent an affiliation with, any person or entity;  (e) use in any manner not authorized by a Platform Application User; except as otherwise authorized by a Platform Application User with respect to such Platform Application User’s Content; (f) mine or analyze any Content transmitted to, retrieved from or stored in the Platform Products/the Service (including, but not limited to, through spiders, robots, crawlers, data mining tools, scrapers, or other automated means, or services employing any such means); (g) circumvent any security measures or content filtering devices;  (h) use or affect the Platform Products in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the Platform Products (including, but not limited to, flooding the Platform Products with an excessive amount of data or content); or (i) permit use in connection with any purposes or intended application which involves risks or dangers that could lead to death, serious bodily injury, severe physical or property damage, or use for purposes that otherwise require significant safety precautions (e.g. uses of the Platform Products in connection with operation of emergency services, air traffic control, mass transport systems, or nuclear facilities).

Please be aware, however, that if the domain of the email address associated with your account is owned or controlled by an organization (such as your work or school) and that organization establishes a direct relationship with us and wishes to add your account to such relationship, then you may be rolled into that organization's account after a reasonable attempt to notify you of the change. Fourteen (14) days after that attempted notice, if you do not respond or change the email address associated with your account, your account may be deactivated, and Content associated with your account may be deleted.

8\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
----------------------------

During your use of the Services, Box may share with you information that is confidential, sensitive or should be kept secret. For example, if we tell you about our product roadmaps, product designs and architecture, technology and technical information, provide you with security audit reviews, business and marketing plans, or share with you our business processes, these should always be considered confidential to Box.

Similarly, we agree that your Content, credit card/banking information and information contained in your account is confidential to you.

Also, if either of us provide any documents to the other that are labeled "confidential" (or something similar), or provide information (either in writing or verbal) that is of a type that a reasonable person should understand to be confidential such information is to be treated as confidential information.

However, if you tell us information that: (a) we already know at the time you tell us; (b) was told to us by a third party who had the right to tell us; (c) is generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by us without using any of your confidential information, then that information will not be considered confidential. The same goes for information that we tell you that falls into any of these categories.

Lastly, we both agree that: (i) we will treat each other's information with the same degree of care that we treat our own confidential information; (ii) will use each other's confidential information only in connection with these Terms and the Services; (iii) only share the information with others who have a need to know and who have agreed in writing to treat it as confidential (as we've outlined in this section); and (iv) not share the information with any third party except as allowed in these Terms or through the Services. Of course, confidential information will always remain the property of its owner.

9\. CONTENT STORAGE

The Services are provided from the United States. By using and accessing the Services, you understand and agree to the storage of Content and any other personal information in the United States. However, you understand that you (or other people that you collaborate with) can access the Services (including Content) from outside of the United States (subject to applicable law) and that nothing prohibits the processing of other information outside of the United States.

You also agree that if you learn of any unauthorized or unacceptable use of any account, Content or the Service, you will promptly contact Box Support and take all reasonable steps to cooperate with Box and assist in the termination of such use.

11\. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE
----------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time in our sole discretion or disable any Content if a) you are in breach of these Terms; or b) your use of the Services could cause a risk of harm or loss to Box or our other users; or c) Box declines to renew your Subscription Period. When reasonable and as permitted by law, Box will provide you reasonable advance notice of this change as well as an opportunity to correct any actions that led to Box's decision. We will not be able to provide this advance notice if you are in material breach of these Terms, or if such notice would lead to civil or criminal liability for Box, or if providing notice would compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users. For the avoidance of doubt, Box may still make a determination that it does not want to continue offering you access to the Service at any time for any or no reason.

You understand that if your account is suspended or terminated, you may no longer have access to the Content that is stored with the Services.

Upon termination you may request access to your Content, which we will make available, except in cases where we have terminated your account due to your violation of these Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy terms in Section 10. You must make such request within fourteen (14) days following termination otherwise, any Content you have stored with the Services may not be retrievable and we will have no obligation to maintain Content stored in your account after this fourteen (14) day period.

8\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
----------------------------

During your use of the Services, Box may share with you information that is confidential, sensitive or should be kept secret. For example, if we tell you about our product roadmaps, product designs and architecture, technology and technical information, provide you with security audit reviews, business and marketing plans, or share with you our business processes, these should always be considered confidential to Box.

Similarly, we agree that your Content, credit card/banking information and information contained in your account is confidential to you.

Also, if either of us provide any documents to the other that are labeled "confidential" (or something similar), or provide information (either in writing or verbal) that is of a type that a reasonable person should understand to be confidential such information is to be treated as confidential information.

However, if you tell us information that: (a) we already know at the time you tell us; (b) was told to us by a third party who had the right to tell us; (c) is generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by us without using any of your confidential information, then that information will not be considered confidential. The same goes for information that we tell you that falls into any of these categories.

Lastly, we both agree that: (i) we will treat each other's information with the same degree of care that we treat our own confidential information; (ii) will use each other's confidential information only in connection with these Terms and the Services; (iii) only share the information with others who have a need to know and who have agreed in writing to treat it as confidential (as we've outlined in this section); and (iv) not share the information with any third party except as allowed in these Terms or through the Services. Of course, confidential information will always remain the property of its owner.

Since our products are cloud based, you can access them through the web and through any number of device types (e.g., desktop, laptop, tablets, and smartphone devices) that you choose. 

This document, the Box Terms of Service ("**Terms**"), outlines the terms regarding your use of our products.  These Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Box so please read carefully. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not register or use any of the Services.

By using, accessing or browsing the Box Service, platform and products including applications, mobile, software, websites or other properties owned or operated by Box or by registering for a Box account ( "**Services**") you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms for the Services provided by Box ("**Box**" or "**we**"). If you reside in the United States, you are entering into this contract with Box, Inc. If you reside outside of the United States excluding Japan, you are entering into this contract with Box.com (UK) Ltd., a company registered in England and Wales (company number 0809736), VAT number GB177912768. If you reside in Japan, you are entering into this contract with K.K. Box Japan, a company registered in Japan (company number 0104-01-107327). 

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Box that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, "**you**" and "**your**" will refer to that organization) unless that organization has a separate paid contract in effect with us, in which event the terms of that contract will govern your use of the Services. 

In order to use the Service, you must be legally permitted to accept these Terms.

1\. PRIVACY

We use and protect that information as described in our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.box.com/legal/privacypolicy/).

2\. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS
--------------------------

We reserve the right to modify these Terms. We will post the most current version of these Terms at [**www.box.com**](https://www.box.com/home) (the "**Site**"). If we make material changes to these Terms, we will notify you via the Services and/or by email to the address associated with your account. If you do not accept the changes, you must stop using and cancel your account by emailing [**cancel@box.com**](mailto:cancel@box.com).

Certain aspects of the Services may require you to obtain an account by completing a registration form and designating a user ID and password. When registering with Box you must: (a) provide true, current and complete information about yourself on the registration form and (b) maintain such information so it continues to be true, current and complete.

You are entirely responsible for all materials and information that you upload, post or otherwise transmit via the Services (please also see our Acceptable Use Policy in Section 10).

If you choose to use Box Sign, the electronic signing feature Box may make available to you as part of the Box Services ("**Box Sign**"), it is your responsibility to determine whether the features of Box Sign are appropriate for your particular use cases and the laws and regulations that apply to you and the signers of your documents. Box does not commit to maintaining copies of signed agreements or signature logs separately from the files created during the Box Sign process. You have the sole responsibility to ensure these files are maintained appropriately.

If you use Box Sign, it will present this [default disclosure](https://www.box.com/legal/electronic-record-and-signature-disclosure) to each recipient of your Box Sign requests on your behalf unless you have an administrative console and have changed the disclosure settings in that console. By using Box Sign to send files for signature without changing the default disclosure settings, you are adopting this disclosure each time as terms that will govern your Box Sign transaction.

Fourteen (14) days after that attempted notice, if you do not respond or change the email address associated with your account, your account may be deactivated, and Content associated with your account may be deleted.

8\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
----------------------------

During your use of the Services, Box may share with you information that is confidential, sensitive or should be kept secret. For example, if we tell you about our product roadmaps, product designs and architecture, technology and technical information, provide you with security audit reviews, business and marketing plans, or share with you our business processes, these should always be considered confidential to Box. 

Similarly, we agree that your Content, credit card/banking information and information contained in your account is confidential to you. 

Also, if either of us provide any documents to the other that are labeled "confidential" (or something similar), or provide information (either in writing or verbal) that is of a type that a reasonable person should understand to be confidential such information is to be treated as confidential information.

However, if you tell us information that: (a) we already know at the time you tell us; (b) was told to us by a third party who had the right to tell us; (c) is generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by us without using any of your confidential information, then that information will not be considered confidential.  The same goes for information that we tell you that falls into any of these categories.

Lastly, we both agree that: (i) we will treat each other’s information with the same degree of care that we treat our own confidential information; (ii) will use each other’s confidential information only in connection with these Terms and the Services; (iii) only share the information with others who have a need to know and who have agreed in writing to treat it as confidential (as we’ve outlined in this section); and (iv) not share the information with any third party except as allowed in these Terms or through the Services.
