3.2 The User has the duty to choose a username for access and use of the Services and the right to change the password assigned to him/her by Altervista during registration, and acknowledges that username and password constitute the validation system of the User's accesses to the Services and the only suitable means to legitimize the User to access the Services themselves.

The User is required to keep the username and password in the strictest confidence and to guard them with the utmost diligence. The User is also required to choose a password that is not easy to identify. For security reasons, Altervista advises Users to periodically change the password. In this regard, the User acknowledges that Altervista reserves the right to request a password change if it deems such an operation necessary for the protection of the Services and the data contained therein. In fact, knowledge of the username and related password by third parties will allow those third parties to use the Services on their behalf.

In this regard, the User acknowledges that the link to recreate a new password will be sent by Altervista exclusively to the e-mail address indicated by the User when registering with Altervista or when updating such data. For security reasons, it is not intended to send such a link to an e-mail address other than the one indicated in the User's profile. If such address is incorrect and/or updated, therefore, the User acknowledges that, in order to obtain from Altervista the link for the creation of the new password, he/she will have to file a report of theft and/or loss of his/her password to the competent Authorities, assuming any possible burden or cost, including any legal fees, and send a copy of such act to Altervista.

3.4. When filling out the registration form, the User is requested to provide certain personal data, the processing of which is carried out in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter “GDPR”), and in accordance with the information provided to the User during registration.

3.5 The User, moreover, acknowledges that the completion of the registration is subject to the verification, partly automated, by Altervista of the existence of certain requirements including the reliability of the email domain, the type of internet connection (e.g. the use of private connections such as VPN etc. is prohibited), the approximate location of the IP address to the extent that registration to the Hosting Service is not permitted worldwide.

4.20 The User has the right, when allowed by Altervista, to create a Hosted Site by choosing an alternative domain to altervista.org from the list in art. 4.17 above, undertaking to produce original, quality, truthful content and in the language that is in line with the topics and semantic fields linked to the domains and described in the aforementioned list.

In this regard, the User agrees to acquire and retain written copies of the authorizations required by this Section 5.8 and to produce them in all cases required by law or by Altervista.

5.9 In relation to the availability of the aforementioned rights and consents, the User assumes all responsibility, acknowledging that he/she is solely responsible for them, and therefore undertakes to indemnify and hold harmless Altervista, from a substantive and procedural point of view, in relation to any third party dispute.

5.10 The User declares and acknowledges that he/she is solely responsible for the accuracy and truthfulness of the Material entered, and ensures that the same is within his/her legitimate availability, is not contrary to mandatory rules and does not violate any distinctive sign, intellectual property right, industrial right, image right or other right of third parties arising from the applicable legal rules (including any subsequent modification or integration), custom or usage. In any case, the Material entered must not present forms and/or content of a pedo-pornographic, pornographic, obscene, blasphemous or defamatory nature. Therefore, the User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Altervista, substantively and procedurally, in connection with any third party claim that its rights have been violated as a result of the User's posting of any Material through the Service.

5.11 By accepting these General Terms and Conditions, the User agrees to comply with the provisions of the Regulations on the protection of copyright on electronic communication networks and implementing procedures pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 70 of April 9, 2003 referred to in Resolution No. 680/13/CONS of December 12, 2013 (hereinafter the Regulations of the Italian Communications Authority; hereinafter “AGCOM”). For the purposes of this article, the User acknowledges the qualification of Altervista as a “service provider” within the meaning of Art. 1. (f) of the Regulations and that in this capacity Altervista may be the addressee of measures of AGCOM requiring it to provide for the disabling of access or (where possible) the removal of content entered by the User (or other measure suitable to obtain the effect of making such content no longer available to the public), if the User has been held responsible for the unlawful use of digital works pursuant to the Regulations. In the event that a proceeding is instituted before AGCOM in relation to content placed by the User, the latter undertakes to give AGCOM all feedback and information required by the Regulations and acknowledges that Altervista, pursuant to the Regulations, is not obliged to provide any assistance in favor of the User in the context of the aforementioned proceeding. Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, in the event that a proceeding is instituted before AGCOM in relation to content entered by the User and Altervista requests information, documents or clarifications from the User, the User undertakes to provide them promptly and in any event within the term indicated by Altervista. In light of the obligations imposed by law, and in particular by the Rules, on Altervista, the User acknowledges that the latter must disable access to the contents of the Hosted Sites and/or provide for the removal of the contents of the Hosted Sites (or other suitable measure to obtain the effect of making such contents no longer available to the public) and/or implement any other measure imposed by law and/or by the Rules on Altervista.

5.12 Anonymized tracking codes (such as Google Analytics, Comscore, Audiweb, Nielsen Net Ratings) will be present in the layout of the websites created with the pre-installed applications, or installed through its own control panel, for the detection of traffic in an anonymous and aggregated form. These codes will be deactivatable or can be integrated with other tracking codes of the Owner of the Hosted Site. Altervista reserves the right to process in anonymous and aggregate form the information detected by the preset anonymized tracking codes (if active). Such activities do not in any way imply profiling of visitors or forms of control over the Content placed by the User on the Hosted Site.

5.13 In the event that the User activates the Banner Service, the User may make use of tracking codes for profiling visitors to the Hosted Site, which are necessary to optimize the delivery and rendering of Banner Advertisements. The User acknowledges that the activation of tracking codes for profiling are activated exclusively upon the presence and acceptance of the Owner of the Hosted Site's cookie policy by visitors to the same Hosted Site. Such activities do not in any way imply any form of control over the Content placed by the User on the Hosted Site.

**6\. Additional Services**

6.1 Banner or Banner Service

6.1.1 The User may, at its discretion and optionally, place or activate Banners within the Hosted Site.

6.1.2 By activating the Banner Service or placing Banners on the Hosted Site, the User declares that he/she also fully accepts the “Supplementary Rules for the activation of Banners” set forth in Article 17 of these General Terms and Conditions.

6.1.3 The Banners allow the User to receive a payment from Altervista based on Advertising Rates and/or Remuneration Levels and/or Criteria (described within the Hosted Site administration panel that the User accesses in order to activate the Banners). Advertising Rates and/or Advertising Formats and/or Pay Ranges may be changed at any time without notice.

6.1.4 Banners are provided by advertisers under existing agreements with Altervista.

6.1.5 IMPORTANT: Except for the activation of the Banner Service, it is forbidden to insert, activate or display on the Hosted Site and/or its Contents any form of banner , popUp or popUnder, and/or activate and/or insert any other form of advertising and/or source of monetization of the Hosted Site traffic and/or any type of advertising network or adserver or to license to third parties advertising or promotional space on the Hosted Site and/or Contents and/or to use other forms of sponsorship and codes different from those made available by Altervista without explicit written authorization from the Altervista staff. Exceptions to these prohibitions are made only exclusively for Google AdSense Banner advertisements, but only in the event that the contract between the User and Google for Adsense Banners has been perfected by the User through Altervista's control panel, or the association of an already active AdSense account is perfected, again through Altervista's control panel.

6.1.6 The provision of Google AdSense Advertising Banners takes place following the signing of a direct agreement between the User and Google, Altervista is therefore not responsible regarding the relationship between the User and Google, nor of the payment of the fees due to the User, which is the sole responsibility of Google. However, User acknowledges and agrees that following User's activation of Google AdSense, Google will recognize Altervista a revenue sharing on Google AdSense revenues generated by the Hosted Site.

6.1.7 User acknowledges and agrees that Google may suspend, at its sole discretion, the provision of Google Adsense Banner advertisements, without Altervista having any liability in this regard. Following Google's suspension of the provision of Google Adsense Banner Ads, Altervista may consider whether or not to suspend the provision of the Banner Service for the Hosted Site.

6.1.8 It is prohibited to set up web pages on the Hosted Site exclusively or predominantly devoted to Banners and/or Adsense Banners, and it is also not permitted to place advertising elements on pages under construction or within pages devoid of content. Banners must be placed in a conspicuous location and may not be stacked haphazardly, or placed adjacent to one another, or placed at the bottom of the page, except as provided by Altervista.

However, Banners must always be well spaced from each other within the same web page, always be separated from each other by appropriate amounts of Non-Advertising Content, and their overall footprint on any single web page must never exceed that of Non-Advertising Content. All of the above also applies to Google Adsense Banners and to the possible co-presence on the same web page of Banners and Google Adsense Banners.

6.1.9 The User acknowledges and accepts that advertisers, by way of example but not limited to: Google, Facebook, Amazon, subject advertising traffic to extremely strict automatic controls in order to prevent fraud and verify full compliance with the quality guidelines summarized in the Supplementary Rules for the activation of Banners.

6.1.10 Any attempt aimed at artificially inflating the revenues accrued by Users through the Banners will automatically result in the ouster of the Hosted Site from providing the Banners, the suspension of the User's account and, in case of recurrence, the possible reporting to the Public Authorities. Purely by way of example but not limited to, it is prohibited to repeatedly click on one's own advertising elements (the Banners), use systems for generating visits/clicks (autosurf, autohit, traffic exchange, etc...) on one's Hosted Site and/or on the Banners, clickjacking and tampering or modifying the Banner delivery codes without any written authorization from Altervista.

6.1.11 It is forbidden to include within the text and Content of the Hosted Site, phrases that may induce the visitor of the same to click on the Banners, i.e., insert phrases such as “contribute to the maintenance of the site” or “support us.”

6.1.12 Banners must always be placed in a prominent position and must never be cut off or partially covered, that is, they must always be displayed in their entirety.

6.1.13 The placement of Banner advertisements on the Hosted Sites, which is optional pursuant to the first paragraph of this Article, is done automatically and manually by the User in its Hosted Site, through external services such as, but not limited to, Criteo, Krux, DoubleClick for Publishers and Google AdSense, or other adservers or ad networks. Therefore, in order to provide the Banner Service, to allow its best monetization and perform analysis, the User agrees to insert and allows Altervista to insert all the necessary tracking codes (without this implying any intervention or form of control by Altervista on the Content placed by the User on the Hosted Site ), which may change over time according to the needs of Altervista (such as but not limited to: Krux, Criteo, Google Analytics, Google Adsense, Doubleclick for Publisher, Facebook etc.).

6.1.14 That said, Altervista acknowledges that, as with all other services offered, it does not directly and/or indirectly implement, manage, nor does it supervise and/or control in any way the content of the banner advertisements disseminated on the Hosted Sites. In relation to this activity, Altervista is to be understood as a hosting service provider, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 DSA and therefore, is not responsible for the content of the banners conveyed on the Hosted Sites.

6.1.15 In case of violation by the User of the provisions of this Article 6 or the “Supplementary Rules for the activation of Banners”, the User will be obliged to pay a penalty (pursuant to Article 1382 of the Italian Civil Code). The amount of the penalty due is equal to the total amount of credits for Banners accrued by the User and not yet collected, as quantified and specified in the User's administration panel, as of the date of Altervista's communication with which the violation is contested, without prejudice in any case to Altervista's right to take legal action for any greater damages. Altervista reserves the right to offset, pursuant to Article 1252 of the Italian Civil Code, the claim arising from the above penalty with its own debt arising from the balance for the Banners claimed by the User. Altervista may at its sole discretion decide to rehabilitate the User responsible for the violation to the Banners functionality.

6.1.16 The User guarantees the compliance of its Hosted Site with all applicable regulations, in particular, the User undertakes to produce and keep updated and to publish in a suitable manner on the Hosted Site, autonomously or thanks, when present, to the tools offered by Altervista, the cookie policy, suitable for the provision of the Services, and any other disclaimer and/or privacy policy necessary for the provision of the Banner advertising, under penalty of immediate suspension of the Banner Service. It is understood as of now that the implementation of the tools offered by Altervista (e.g. cookie policy, privacy policy) will be at the exclusive charge and responsibility of the User, who will have to adapt them from time to time to their specific needs. The User, therefore, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Altervista and/or the Company from any third party claims that may be made in relation to such tools.

6.1.17 Without implying any intervention or form of control by Altervista over the Content placed by the User on the Hosted Site, the User acknowledges and accepts that the Advertising Formats and/or Advertising Rates and/or their availability within each Pay Band may be modified at any time and without prior notice. The User, furthermore, acknowledges and accepts that the Advertising Rates of the individual Advertising Formats may be subject to change and/or differentiation depending on their belonging to certain Remuneration Bands and that different Advertising Rates may be applied to the same Advertising Format due to the semantic field to which the Hosted Site belongs, the traffic generated by the Hosted Site and/or Banners and generally all the criteria underlying the determination of the Remuneration Bands. Finally, the User acknowledges and accepts that new and/or modified and/or eliminated (including permanently) existing Advertising Bands may be created at any time and with immediate effect. In case of elimination, the Hosted Sites belonging to the eliminated band will be reallocated to another Advertising Band.

6.1.18 Altervista reserves the right to apply special conditions also to the individual Hosted Site as well as to exclude it from the provision of the Banner Service, the latter point if at the request of its advertising concessionaire.

6.1.19 Altervista reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, the access of the Hosted Site to each of the Remuneration Levels, as well as moving the Hosted Site from one Remuneration Level to another.

6.1.20 Altervista reserves the right to terminate even permanently and without notice the provision of the Banner Service and possibly also the Service to the individual User in the event that it becomes aware that the latter violates or has violated the General Conditions or the particular terms and conditions applicable to the Banner Service.

6.2 Notification(s) - Push Notification Service

6.2.1 The Owner of the Hosted Site may, optionally and at its own discretion, activate the Push Notification Service that allows it to send to visitors of the Hosted Site who have provided appropriate authorization through their browser and/or by activating the token, notifications of updates or new content (such as but not limited to images, text and links) chosen by the Owner of the Hosted Site and provided that they are supported by web push notification technology.

6.2.2 The User acknowledges and accepts that the authorization of each of the visitors to the Hosted Site to receive the Notifications may be revoked by the visitor at any time through his or her browser.

6.2.3 Likewise, the Owner of the Hosted Site may revoke, at any time, its consent to use the Push Notifications Service by accessing the Altervista administration panel.

6.2.4 By activating the Push Notifications Service, the User declares that he/she also fully accepts the “Supplementary Rules for the activation of Notifications” referred to in Article 18 of these General Conditions.

6.2.5 Activation and use of the Push Notification Service is available only and exclusively for Blogs placed in Remuneration Levels and cannot be activated from all Remuneration Levels.

6.2.6 The Push Notifications Service is provided free of charge and may be provided in whole or in part through the use of third-party messaging services.

6.2.7 The User acknowledges and accepts that the Push Notification Service, due to technological limitations, cannot be guaranteed and in the event of significant obstacles in continuing delivery may be discontinued in whole or in part or temporarily suspended.

6.2.8 In case of violation by the User of the provisions of this Article 6.2 or of the “Supplementary rules for the activation of Notifications” Altervista reserves the right to grant and temporary or permanent interruption of the provision of the service to the individual Hosted Site.

6.2.9 Altervista acknowledges that, as with all other Services offered, it does not directly and/or indirectly implement, manage, or supervise and/or control in any way the content of the Notifications. In relation to such activity, Altervista is to be understood as a hosting service provider, in accordance with the provisions of art. 6 of the DSA and therefore, is not responsible for the content of the Notifications sent by the Owners of the Hosted Sites. The User, therefore, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Altervista and/or the Company from any third party claims that may be made in relation to this specific Service and, in particular, the content of the Notifications. The User acknowledges that Altervista, in fulfillment of its obligations under Articles 6 DSA and 17 of Legislative Decree 70/2003 (consistent with the provisions of Art. 8 of the DSA), is obliged to report any Illegal Content sent through the Notification Service by the Owners of the Hosted Sites to the competent authorities and/or (where possible) disable access to such content and/or provide (where possible) for the removal of the content (or other suitable measure to achieve the effect of making such content no longer available to the public) and/or implement any other measure imposed by law or by the competent authorities against Altervista.

**7\. Remuneration for advertisement on the hosted sites**

7.1 Altervista undertakes to make payment of the amounts accrued as a result of the insertion or activation of Banners on the Hosted Site as resulting from its advertising statistics service, which the User is entitled to check directly on the administration panel of the Hosted Site.

7.2 It is possible to obtain payment of the credit (of the amounts accrued) upon reaching the minimum threshold of 36.15 euros including any sign-up bonus allocated to each User at the time of registration. The User also has the right to choose the mode of payment among those available, modes that may vary over time , and which, in any case, must comply with the regulations on the traceability of financial flows and anti-money laundering

7.3 In order for the payment to be made correctly, it is necessary to send the data and documentation that may be required, including if required copy of a legally valid identification document and tax code (in the case of payments required through the use of a Paypal account, sending a copy of the identity document and tax code is mandatory), within the timeframe referred to in art. 7.4 below, in addition, the payment of remuneration accrued is not transferable, so it can only be sent to the User.

7.4 If, at the end of each calendar month, the User has reached the minimum threshold as indicated in Article 7.2 above, the User shall have six (6) months to provide Altervista with the necessary payment details. Otherwise, the credit will be extinguished and the User will no longer be able to make any claim in this regard against Altervista.

7.5 The User acknowledges that in the event Altervista archives its Hosted Site due to inactivity and/or abandonment, as better described and specified in Article 10.2 below, and the User fails to restore it within the term set forth in Article 10.3 below, any credit accrued by hosting advertising Banners on such Hosted Site will be lost and can no longer be recovered. In the event of reactivation of the Hosted Site, however, the rules set forth in Article 7.4 above shall apply.

**8\. Spam protection**

Altervista is against spam (generically understood as the sending of unsolicited and unwanted messages to indistinct subjects) practiced in any form and by any means. Users therefore agree not to use Altervista's resources for this type of activity, which includes, by way of example but not limited to, sending messages that can be considered spam and that contain links to one or more of Altervista's domains, regardless of whether the mail server used to send them belongs to the Altervista network or not.

**15\. Rules applicable to the Forum**

15.1 The Altervista Forum (forum.it.altervista.org / forum.en.altervista.org) is a tool that provides technical support to Users, both on topics regarding the operation of Altervista's services and on generic topics related to website building and programming. Publication of content in the Forum is restricted to Users logged in via the Altervista Login, while simple reading is also open to visitors.

15.2 Users of the Forum are also bound by the following rules:

Forum moderators are not subject to the control of Altervista management and voluntarily take on the task of monitoring discussions. Therefore, Altervista does not ensure their constant presence. Altervista disclaims any responsibility for the activity performed by them. The group of moderators is an open group that anyone can request to be part of; it is composed of Users who voluntarily offer to keep the Forum in order. In order to ensure the proper functioning of the Forum, just as the moderators undertake to carry out their duties as seriously and fairly as possible, so do the Users undertake to make the work of moderation possible by respecting the moderators themselves and the decisions made by them.

* Research should be done before opening a discussion.
* There is no obligation on the part of Users or moderators to answer questions posed within the Forum.
* Spamming, crossposting, UP, OT activities are not allowed.
* Any User may be “banned,” i.e., lose the right to write on the Forum for the duration of the ban, with any account in his/her possession. In case of using other accounts they too will be banned for a period equal to or longer than the main penalty. The decision to ban a User is made by the moderators.

For all the above bans and in order to simplify the work of moderation and control by Users of the warnings received, a point system is introduced. Upon issuance of a warning the User will be notified of the infraction, the infraction score, and the expiration date of the score. Upon reaching certain score thresholds a ban from the Forum will be automatically triggered.

The table of infractions and thresholds follows:

Types of offenses:

* Racial, religious, political discrimination: 15 points - 6 months
* Insults / Vulgar language: 10 points - 6 months
* Private discussions in public: 10 points - 5 months
* Spam / cross posting: 10 points - 6 months

* Title not explicit: 5 points - 1 month
* Wrong section: 5 points - 1 month
* Signature too long: 5 points - 1 month
* Presence with other nick if banned: 50 points - no deadline

Punishment thresholds:

* 20 points 3 days ban
* 25 points 7 days ban
* 30 points 1 month ban
* 35 points 3 months ban
* 50 points permanent ban

In order to keep the Forum as clean as possible for clear and easy navigation and reference to the staff moving posts to suitable areas a redirect to the moved thread will be left, this redirect will be valid for 1 week, after which it will no longer be usable and visible (only the redirect).

**16\. Special terms and conditions applicable ONLY to who requires a second level domain registration (“Domain registration service”)**

To Users, who use the Domain Registration Service, the provisions set forth in the General Conditions shall apply. For the purposes of the General Conditions, the provisions provided for the Service shall be deemed to extend to the Domain Registration Service, unless expressly provided. Users of the Domain Registration Service are also bound by the following terms and conditions.

16.1 The Domain Registration Service allows for the registration of one's own second-level domain (e.g. yourname.com, .org., .net, .info, .it), with the further possibility of modulating certain additional services (hereinafter “Additional Services”), as explained in detail at www.altervista.org (or specific language localizations, e.g. it.altervista.org, en.altervista.org, etc.). Registration of a domain does not involve the creation of a new webspace, nor any changes to the existing webspace, or the associated virtual host.

16.2 The offer and updated features of the Domain Registration Service and the Additional Services can be found at www.altervista.org (or specific language localizations, e.g. it.altervista.org, en.altervista.org, etc.).

16.3 The User who decides to use, for a fee, the Domain Registration Service and the Accessory Services has the right to choose the payment method, among those indicated in the control panel.

16.4 The User acknowledges that the registration of a .biz domain is reserved for those who make use of it or intend in good faith to make use of it for a commercial activity or otherwise instrumental to the exchange of goods or services.

16.5 Altervista proceeds with the registration of domain names according to the chronological order of requests and assumes no responsibility for the acceptance of registrations by the competent Registration Authorities, nor for disputes, which may arise regarding the assignment of a domain name, nor for any changes in the registration procedures or naming rules by the aforementioned Registration Authorities, since these are events beyond its control.

16.6 Altervista undertakes to maintain the Domain Registration Service in an efficient and functional manner. Altervista disclaims any liability for direct or indirect damages caused by the service itself, it being understood that in the event of non-renewal of the domain name registration for causes attributable to Altervista, Altervista will be required to pay a penalty in favor of the registrant equal to three times the amount paid by the registrant for the domain name renewal request, to the exclusion of any other claim or compensation by the User.

16.7 The User is required to check with the registries kept by the competent Registration Authorities that the registration procedures have been successful.

16.8 The Domain Registration Service has a term of one year from the date of actual registration of the domain name. Upon expiration of the year, the Domain Registration Service will be discontinued, unless renewed at least 30 days prior to expiration by payment of the fee at the rates in effect at the time of renewal.

16.9 You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be familiar with the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy in effect with respect to the requested Domain Registration Service.

16.10 Altervista reserves the right to modify the Domain Registration Service and vary the conditions of the offer at any time, in the manner set forth in Article 12 of the General Conditions. However, for each Contract already in force, the conditions in force at the time of the conclusion of the Contract itself will be guaranteed until its annual expiration.

16.11 In case of transfer of the domain to another provider or maintainer, carried out by the User, the Contract will be understood to be terminated at the User's will as of the date of the conclusion of the transfer, with the consequent deactivation of all Accessory Services provided. Altervista shall retain as consideration for the termination any sums already paid relating to the remaining term of the Contract.

16.12 Altervista reserves the right to suspend the Domain Registration Service and the Accessory Services, in the event of a dispute with a third party regarding the registered domain name, pending the resolution of the dispute itself, being excluded any reimbursement or compensation or liability of Altervista for the User's failure to use the Domain Registration Service and the Accessory Services during the period of suspension.

16.13 The User acknowledges that it is his or her responsibility to be familiar with the rules for the processing of his or her personal data by the competent Registration Authorities in the various jurisdictions encompassed by the chosen domain name, stating that he or she is aware that such rules may provide for obligations to disseminate or register personal data in registers accessible to the public via the Internet, without any control by Altervista.

16.14 The User acknowledges that it is his or her burden and responsibility to keep the domain name holder data up to date and indemnifies Altervista from service interruptions imposed by Registration Authorities and Registries as a result of failures to update and verify the aforementioned data.
