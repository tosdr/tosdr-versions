=======================================

A. A. Who are we and why are we providing this document?
--------------------------------------------------------

For years the Mondadori Group, a corporate group consisting of companies subject to the management and coordination activity of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A. holding company (hereinafter “**Mondadori Group**”) in accordance with CC article 2359, considers of crucial importance the protection of his actual and/or potential clients and users personal data guaranteeing that their processing, carried out by any means, automated or manual, fully respects the safeguards and rights recognized by the European Parliament and Council Regulation 2016/679, of April 27th 2016, relative to protection of natural persons with regard to Personal Data Processing, as well as to the free movement of such data (hereinafter the “**Regulation**”), and by any further applicable rules in the matter of protection of personal data.

The term “personal data” refers to the definition contained in article 4, point 1 of the Regulation, namely “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person” (hereinafter “**Personal Data**”).

The Regulation foresees that, before processing Personal Data – where this term, according to its definition contained in article 4, point 2 of the Regulation, should be intended as “any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction” (hereinafter the “**Processing**”) – it is necessary for the person, owner of such Personal Data, in this case you as user/visitor (hereinafter the “**User**”) of this website (hereinafter “**Website**”) and/or mobile app (hereinafter “**Mobile App**”), to be informed of the reasons why such data are been requested and how they will be used.

In this regard, this document aims to provide you, in a simple and intuitive way, with all useful and appropriate information so that you can be consciously informed of the use and processing of your Personal Data carried out by Cookies as later defined and used by this Website.

The extended information about the use of Cookies and other similar technologies (so-called **Cookie Policy**) has been, then, drawn up according to the principle of transparency and to all elements requested by article 13 of the Regulation and has been divided into single sections (hereinafter “**Sections**” and singularly “**Section**”), each of which deals with a specific topic to make your reading more simple and easy to understand.

B. What are Cookies?
--------------------

Cookies are text strings made up of chunks of code sent by a web server (for example, a site) to an Internet browser and installed on it. In particular, they are small text files that the websites visited by users send to their terminals, where they are stored and then sent back to the same sites on the occasion of a subsequent visit. Almost all browsers are set up to allow the automatic storage of Cookies on the User terminal.

Cookies are used for various purposes, they have different peculiarities and can be used both by the Processing Owner, by the Processing Co-owners, as identified and defined in the following, as well as by third parties who use or can use on the Website, even in combination between them, the following cookies categories, divided in accordance with the classification proposed in Opinion 04/2012 relative to exemption from consent for the use of cookies published by the Working Party article 29 within the EU (available here):

### Session or permanent Cookies

Cookies can expire at the end of the browser session (the period of time between the user opening of a browser window and its closing) or can be stored for a longer period. Session Cookies are those who allow websites to link the user actions during a browser session. Session Cookies expire when the browser session ends. Permanent Cookies are stored on the user device between browser sessions, for variable periods of time, and facilitate the storage of Users preferences or actions in relation to a website.

### Technical or profiling Cookies

Technical Cookies are those used by the Owner of a website for the sole purpose of transmitting a message via a electronic communication network, or as is strictly necessary for a service provider of the information society to provide the service the subscriber or user has explicitly requested. For the installation of this Cookies the prior consent of the Users is not required, wherever used directly by the site manager. Profiling Cookies are designed to create user-related profiles and are used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the User while navigating. Given the considerable invasive nature that this Cookies can have in regard to the Users privacy, the European and Italian Legislation foresees that the User should be adequately informed on their use through a short policy (banner) and a extended one on the site, and that he must express his consent the first time he visits the site. Such consent can be expressed in general, by interacting with the short policy banner on the landing page of the site, in the manner indicated on that banner, or it can be provided or denied in a selective manner, following the procedures described below. This consent shall be tracked on the occasion of subsequent visits. However, the User has always the option to withdraw all or part of the consent already expressed.

### First or third party Cookies

A Cookie is “of first party” (so-called first party cookie) or “of third party” (third party cookie) depending on the website or the domain it comes from.  
First party Cookies are, basically, those set and/or managed by the site owner. For these Cookies the obligation to provide information, obtain the consent and/or allow the possible blocking of Cookies shall rest with the owner of the site. Third party Cookies are those set by a domain other than the one being visited by the User. For these Cookies, the obligation to provide information and to describe the method for consenting or blocking Cookies lies with the third party, while the owner of the site is only obliged to insert on his site a link to the third party site where those elements are available.

C. Other technologies similar to Cookies used in mobile apps
------------------------------------------------------------

The Processing Owner, Co-owners and third parties can use, especially for mobile apps, technologies similar to Cookies and aimed at information storage and recovery relative to your device and his use. Those activities can be carried out using:

* Pixel Tag or Web Beacon

A Pixel Tag (known as “web beacon” or “tracking pixel”) is a smaller transparent graphic file (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is embedded in a web page, in combination with a Cookie, or within a mobile app and allows the collection of information related to the use of the web page and/or mobile app which contains the tracking pixel. The pixel tags can be used for different purposes, such as, including but not limited to, analyzing the use of websites and/or mobile apps, controlling and reporting on advertisement, and personalizing ads and contents.

* Mobile device identifiers and SDK

A SDK mobile is a pixel tag or web beacon version (aforementioned) only for mobile applications. A SDK is a chunk of code that developers can include in mobile apps to allow displaying ads, collecting data and implementing related services. This technology is used to provide you, through mobile apps and browsers, with specific ads and features based on insights associated to your device or tablet.

Some of the services listed below in accordance with the feature offered to the Users, focused on the use of third party SDK, could require no User consent. Besides, those third parties could – in addition to what is specified in this Cookie Policy and also unbeknownst to the Processing Owner and/or the Co-owners – make further tracking activities on the User. For detailed information on the matter, please consult the respective privacy policies of the listed services, where you may receive all information regarding data processing and consent withdrawal.

**Next Media.** The purpose of Next Media services is to offer personalized ads to editors Users (through their websites and/or mobile apps), and to be a technological support for any other third party intending to offer the same services (“Next Media partners”). Next Media and his partners use identifiers to identify users and provide targeted ads based on their behaviour and/or movements. In order to have more information, or disable Next Media or his partners services, please click [here](https://next14.com/privacy-policy/) or write to [privacy@next14.com](mailto:privacy@next14.com).

**Nielsen Measurement.** Nielsen measurement system allows to collect app usage statistics in order to know the clients’ interests and behaviours better. The service is enabled by default. In case the User want to deactivate Nielsen measurement, he may proceed enabling the option “Limit Ad Tracking” (IOS devices) and “Opt-out of ads personalization” (Android). If the application is installed on more than one device, the setting should be modified for each one of them. (Read Nielsen Privacy Policy: [https://www.nielsen.com/it/it/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/](https://www.nielsen.com/it/it/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/)).

**Marfeel.**We/our partners may store and/or access information on a device (e.g cookies) and process personal data (eg. IP Address) for personalized ads display and content, ad and content measurement, audience insights, product development and creating a personalized ads profile. You can object to this or change choices (e.g. withdraw consent) at any time by clicking the "More options" button or "Manage your cookies" in the website’s main menu. For certain purposes we may use precise geolocation data and/or actively scan device characteristics for identification.

**Notifiche push**. Using the mobile app, you can choose whether to receive from the Processing Owner push notifications on your mobile device or tablet, by accepting this service during the mobile app configuration. If at a later time you should decide to no longer receive push notifications, you may disable them using your mobile device and/or the same mobile app setting features.
