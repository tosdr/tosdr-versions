Last Updated: December 19, 2023 | Effective: January 1, 2024

Welcome! Thank you for using Asana!

### **1\. Introduction**

Asana, Inc. (“Asana,” “we,” “our,” “us”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools, as further described in the [Asana Guide](https://asana.com/guide/help) and its [Release Notes](https://asana.com/guide/help/faq/release-notes)  (collectively, the “**Service**”), and websites, including but not limited to www.asana.com, wavelength.com, blog.asana.com, community.asana.com (the “**Websites**”).

These User Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) are a binding legal contract between you and Asana and explain the rules governing your use of our Service and Websites.  These Terms apply to you as a user of the Service, subject to exceptions that apply to Managed Users (as defined and further detailed below in Section 2 (How These Terms Apply)).  By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms (as applicable) and confirm you have read and understand our [Privacy Statement](https://asana.com/terms/privacy-statement), which is incorporated by reference.

If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service or Websites.

We may revise these Terms from time to time by posting a modified version on our website.  If, in Asana’s sole discretion, the modifications to these Terms are material, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by alerting you through the Service and/or Websites.  If you do not agree to or cannot comply with the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service and Websites.  Unless otherwise stated elsewhere in these Terms or in our notice, the updated Terms will take effect upon their posting and will apply on a going-forward basis.  Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any update to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

### **2\. How These Terms Apply**

By using Asana, you fall into one or more of the following three different categories of Asana user:

* “**Site Visitors**” are users of the Websites.
    
* “**Free Users**” use the free/basic version of the Service.  Free Users have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Managed Users.  Free Users may have their own individual workspaces and/or take part in a free multi-user Asana domain.
    
* “**Managed Users**” use the Service as part of any paid Asana subscription plan purchased by a person or entity (the “**Customer**”) who has separately entered into a written agreement with Asana (the “**Customer Agreement**”) governing access and use of the Service and permitting such Customer to create and configure Asana so that Managed Users may join.
    

To the extent you are a Managed User, only the following sections of these Terms will apply to you: Section 1 (Introduction); Section 2 (How These Terms Apply); and Section 6 (Acceptable Use Policy).

As a Managed User, you gain access to the Service through a Customer of Asana.  For example, if you are joining your employer’s organization, Customer is your employer.  If you are joining a workspace created by your friend using a personal email address, your friend is the Asana Customer and is authorizing you to join his or her workspace.  The Customer Agreement governs our relationship and commitment to deliver the Service to that Customer, who may then invite Managed Users to join their Asana instance.  When you or another Managed User submit content or information to the Service, such as messages or files (“**Customer Data**”), you acknowledge and agree that, as between Asana and Customer, the Customer Data is controlled by Customer and the Customer Agreement provides Customer with choices and control over that Customer Data.  For example, Customer may manage permissions, enable or disable third party integrations, or take steps to expand, consolidate or share the contents of Asana portfolios, projects, tasks and subtasks, and these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data.

AS BETWEEN ASANA AND CUSTOMER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS SOLELY CUSTOMER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO (A) INFORM YOU AND ANY OTHER MANAGED USERS OF ANY RELEVANT CUSTOMER POLICIES, PRACTICES AND SETTINGS THAT MAY IMPACT THE PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA; (B) OBTAIN ANY RIGHTS, PERMISSIONS OR CONSENTS FROM YOU AND ANY OTHER MANAGED USERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE LAWFUL USE OF CUSTOMER DATA AND THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE; (C) ENSURE THAT THE TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA UNDER THE CUSTOMER AGREEMENT IS LAWFUL; AND (D) RESPOND TO AND RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH YOU AND ANY OTHER MANAGED USERS RELATING TO CUSTOMER DATA, THE SERVICE OR CUSTOMER’S FAILURE TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS. IN YOUR CAPACITY AS AN MANAGED USER, ASANA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) TO YOU RELATING TO THE SERVICE, WHICH IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

### **3\. Eligibility and Scope**

To use the Service and Websites you must be, and you represent and warrant that you are, at least 16 years of age and competent to agree to these Terms.  If the law where you reside requires that you must be older in order for Asana to lawfully provide the Service and Websites to you and use your personal data without parental consent, then you must be that older age.

If the representations in the preceding sentence are not true, or if Asana has previously prohibited you from accessing or using the Service and Websites, you may not access or use the Service and Websites.

### **4\. Account Registration and Use**

**4.1 Account Registration and Confidentiality.**  To access the Service and certain parts of our Websites, you must register for an Asana account by creating a username and password.  You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and current registration information about yourself.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential and secure, and you agree that you will not allow others to access the Service using your Asana account.  By registering, you agree that you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password.  We may assume that any communications we receive under your account have been made by you.  If you are a workspace or organization owner or administrator, or if you have confirmed in writing that you have the authority to make decisions on behalf of a workspace or organization (“**Account Administrator**”), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to to do so and agree that Asana is entitled to rely on your instructions.

**4.2 Unauthorized Account Use.**  You are responsible for notifying us at support@asana.com if you become aware of any unauthorized use of or access to your account.  You understand and agree that we may require you to provide information that may be used to confirm your identity and help ensure the security of your account.  Asana will not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or attorneys’ fees that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have advised us of such unauthorized use.  You will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred by Asana or a third party due to someone else using your account.  In the event that the Account Administrator or Customer loses access to an account or otherwise requests information about an account, Asana reserves the right in its sole discretion to request from the Account Administrator or Customer any verification it deems necessary before restoring access to or providing information about such account.

The Service and Websites may include information and content provided by third parties, including links to third-party websites, resources, and/or goods and services.  Asana is not responsible and will not be liable for any damages or losses caused by or relating to, (i) any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources, (ii) the availability of or any errors or omissions in such websites or resources, or (iii) any information handling practices or other business practices of the operators of such sites or resources.  Your interactions with such third parties will be governed by the third parties’ own terms of service and privacy policies, and any other similar terms.

### **12\. General Terms**

**12.1 Modifications to the Service.**  We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service and Websites (or any part thereof), with or without notice.  You agree that Asana shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Service and Websites.

**12.2 Controlling Law.**  These Terms will be governed by the laws of California notwithstanding its conflicts of law principles.  However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country.  This paragraph does not override those laws.

**12.3 Initial Dispute Resolution.**  Most disputes can be resolved without resort to formal dispute resolution.  If you take any issue with us or our Service, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at [dispute-notice@asana.com](mailto:dispute-notice@asana.com) and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account).  Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Asana, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit .

**12.4 No Waiver.**  The failure of Asana to exercise or enforce any right or remedy in these Terms does not waive that right or remedy.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

**12.5 Third-Party Beneficiaries.**  You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

**12.6 Entire Agreement.**  These Terms (and all terms and conditions incorporated herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Asana, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Asana on the subject matter.  To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these Terms and any other terms or resources referenced in these Terms, the terms contained directly in these Terms will first prevail; provided, however, that if there is a conflict or inconsistency between an applicable Customer Agreement and these Terms, the terms of the Customer Agreement will first prevail, followed by the provisions in these Terms, and then followed by the pages referenced in these Terms (e.g., the Privacy Statement).  The applicable Customer will be responsible for notifying Managed Users of those conflicts or inconsistencies and until such time the terms set forth herein will be binding.

**12.7 Translations.** Any non-English translations of these Terms are provided for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version shall control.

**12.8 Miscellaneous.**  These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by you.  These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may be assigned or delegated by Asana without restriction.  These Terms bind and inure to the benefit of each party and the party’s successors and permitted assigns.  These Terms may not be modified by an oral statement by a representative of Asana.  No agency, partnership, joint venture or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by these Terms.  You agree that any agreements made by and between you and us in electronic form are as legally binding as if made in physical written form.  If you are using the Service and Websites for or on behalf of the U.S.  government, your license rights do not exceed those granted to non-government consumers.  The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  Any provision of these Terms that by its nature is reasonably intended to survive beyond their termination or expiration shall survive.  Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the following sections shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms: Sections 1 (Introduction); 2 (How These Terms Apply); 7 (Proprietary Rights); 8 (User Content and Feedback); 9 (Warranties, Disclaimer, and Limitation of Liability); 10 (Indemnification); and 12 (General Terms).

**12.9 Notices.**  We may deliver notice to you by email, posting a notice on the Service and Websites or any other method we choose and such notice will be effective on dispatch.  If you give notice to us, it will be effective when received and you must use the following physical or email address: (1) Asana, Inc.  633 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107; or (2) [legal@asana.com](mailto:terms-questions@asana.com).
