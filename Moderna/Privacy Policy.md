Before providing it to us, carefully consider whether to disclose your Sensitive Personal Data. If you do provide Sensitive Personal Data to us, you consent to its use and disclosure for the purposes and in the manner described in this Privacy Statement.

You may visit our website without voluntarily providing any information about yourself. You are not obligated to provide any Personal Data to us, but your ability to use our website or its features, apply for an employment position or report an adverse event may be limited. When calling our call centers, you can choose to remain anonymous unless the collection of personal data is required by law or you provide us with your personal data.

If you provide us with Personal Data about another person or allow us to collect it, you acknowledge that you have the authority to share that information and are allowing us to use the information as described in this Privacy Statement.

### 2\. How Information is Collected and Used

#### a. Information that you voluntarily provide

We collect and use the Personal Data that you voluntarily provide to us by visiting our sites or using our services. You may use certain services without registering or identifying yourself but, if you do not register, you may not have access to all of the services or functionality of the site. If you choose to register, we may use the Personal Data you provide to confirm your registration and to respond to requests from you.

Upon your request, we may also use your Personal Data to send you special promotions or newsletters with information that may interest you.

If you are a healthcare professional or an institutional healthcare provider, you are responsible for obtaining any legally required authorization, consent or other permission from your patients prior to providing their Personal Data to Moderna. By submitting any Personal Data about a patient, you represent and warrant to Moderna that you have obtained all required permissions to do so.

#### b. Through your use of interactive services

If you choose to participate in our questionnaires and surveys and other interactive services, we will collect the information, including health-related information and other Sensitive Personal Data that you share to help us better understand how Moderna products are used in coping with the diseases for which they are marketed.

#### c. When you’re interested in enrolling in a clinical trial

If you submit health-related Personal Data to us to participate in a clinical trial, we may use your Personal Data to assess whether you qualify for enrollment in the trial, to contact you about potential participation in the trial, and to provide you with additional information about the trial.

Once enrolled for any questions relating to your participation in a clinical trial, contact the Principal Investigator on the study and/or refer to the trail related information provided to you, e.g., the Informed Consent Form.

#### d. When you correspond with Moderna about Moderna products.

If you contact Moderna or use the Services to ask questions or report problems regarding your experience in using one of our products, we may use the information you provide in submitting reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency or any other relevant supervisory authority and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an event involving use of our product.

#### e. Through data collection tools

When permitted or you have provided consent, Moderna automatically will collect information about use of the Services through data collection tools, such as web beacons and cookies. A "web beacon" is a piece of code that enables us to monitor user activity and website traffic. A "cookie" is a randomly generated unique numeric code stored in the user’s web browser settings or computer’s hard drive. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires), as well as the randomly generated unique numeric code.

For more details, please see [_Moderna’s Cookie Statement_](https://www.modernatx.com/cookie-statement).

We use the information collected through data collection tools to monitor usage patterns, store information about user preferences and to improve the Services. For example, your Personal Data may be used to create customized offers, information and services tailored to your interests and preferences.  We may track your activities over time and across third-party websites, apps or other online services to display advertisements on third-party websites. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please see “Your Privacy Choices” below.

We also may collect information about the location of the mobile device or tablet used to access the Services (“Location Data”). Location Data includes: (i) the location of the mobile device or tablet derived from GPS or WiFi use; (ii) the IP address of the mobile device or tablet or internet service used to access the Services; and (iii) other information made available by a user or others that indicates the current or prior location of the user, such as geotag information in photographs.

#### f. Social media connections

When accessing the Services through a Facebook or other Social Media account, Moderna may (depending on applicable user privacy settings) automatically have access to information provided to or through the Social Media platform. Moderna may collect and use this information for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement or at the time the information was collected.

#### g. Social media plugins

When you use services, Social Media operators can place a cookie on your computer to recognize individuals who have visited previously. If you are logged into a Social Media account while using the services, the social plugins allow that Social Media to receive information that you have accessed and used the Services. The social plugins also allow the Social Media operator to share information about your activities in or through the Services with other Social Media users. Moderna does not control any of the content from the Social Media plugins. For more information about Social Media plugins, please refer to any privacy and/or other legal notices of the respective Social Media platform.

#### h. Through third parties

Third parties that assist us with our business operations also collect and use information (including Personal Data and Usage Data) and may share the collected information with us. For example, our vendors collect and share information with us to improve user experience, we may view your LinkedIn profile, or any other publicly available profile.

When you access any interactive service, you will be asked to affirmatively choose ("opt in") to provide the requested information. You may always choose not to provide the requested information but then you may not be able to use the Service as intended.

### 3\. Links to Other Websites/Services

As a convenience to our visitors, this website may contain links to other websites that we believe may offer useful information, but that does not mean that Moderna endorses it, or the quality or accuracy of information presented on it. If you decide to visit a third-party site, you are subject to its privacy practices and not this Privacy Statement.

### 4\. How We Use Personal Data

We may use Personal Data for the following purposes.

* monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of our medicinal products, which includes detecting, assessing and preventing adverse events and reporting to the relevant health authorities to meet legal and regulatory obligations,
    

Adverse events refer to the unintended or undesirable events after using a medicinal product. They can be minor at times, or they can also involve serious health issues.

Moderna processes your Personal Data to comply with legal obligations under applicable pharmacovigilance laws and regulations worldwide and where necessary for our legitimate interests in ensuring appropriate pharmacovigilance standards.

Pharmacovigilance laws are issued for reasons of substantial public interest in public health, research as well as quality, safety, and efficacy of medicinal products.

We may also process Personal Data to carry out scientific research in the public interest.

#### d. Our legitimate interests

We may process your Personal Data where it is necessary for our legitimate interest as a company, including to manage, promote and improve our business and manage our risk. For example, we may process your Personal Data to:

* facilitate our recruitment activities (such as evaluating you as a job candidate for an employment activity, and monitoring our recruitment statistics),
    
* tailor the content we display on our website,
    
* protect against, identify, investigate and respond to fraud, illegal activity (such as incidents of hacking or misuse of our website) and claims and other liabilities,
    
* help us comply with our legal or regulatory obligations or our contractual obligations to the U.S. government as a government contractor or other countries as applicable,
    
* maintain the security, safety or property of the website, and
    
* communicate with you for other purposes which are evident from the circumstances or about which we inform you when we collect Personal Data from you.
    

### 5\. How Information is Shared and Disclosed

#### b. Legal requirements

In certain circumstances, Moderna may release your Personal Data in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, regulation, binding order of a data protection agency, governmental request or other legal or regulatory process.

#### c. Corporate changes

We may transfer information, including your Personal data, in connection with a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control by Moderna or any affiliated company (in each case, whether in whole or in part).

We may disclose your Personal Data to HCPs, doctors, care givers, in connection with your adverse event report based on your consent or a legal obligation.

### 6\. How Information is Retained and Secured

We retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations and in line with legal obligations. We retain Personal Data to comply with applicable law, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, and other actions permitted by law. When your Personal Data is no longer needed for Moderna’s business purposes, we dispose of it subject to applicable law.

In accordance with applicable laws, we employ reasonable security measures intended to help protect the security of all information submitted through the Services. The security of information transmitted through the internet cannot, however, be guaranteed. We are not responsible for any interception or interruption of any communications or for changes to or losses of data through the internet. Users of our sites and services are responsible for maintaining the security of any password, user ID or other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas. Any access to our sites or services through your user ID and password will be treated as authorized by you.

To process your request for access or deletion, we must be able to verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty.  We will ask you to provide your contact information and additional identifiers based on your relationship with us.

You may designate an authorized agent to make a request to access, delete, or opt-out of the sale of your information on your behalf.  When you use an authorized agent to submit a request for access or deletion, you must provide the authorized agent with written permission to do so, and, in certain circumstances, we may ask you to verify your own identity directly with us.  We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.

* _Right to Know:_
    
    Please note that we may not be required to provide you access to the specific pieces of information we have collected about you or delete information if we are unable to verify your identity.
    
* _Right to Delete:_
    
    We may not be required to delete information under certain circumstances. Specifically, the CCPA includes exemptions that provide that we do not have to delete data that, for example, is necessary to comply with legal obligations including those pertaining to the quality, safety or effectiveness of a product or activity regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), complete a transaction, detect security incidents, or for certain other internal purposes.
    
* _Sale or Disclosure of Personal data:_ The CCPA defines “sale” broadly to include sharing, transferring, disclosing or otherwise communicating personal data with a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. We share personal data with service providers who work on our behalf and agree not to use or sell your personal data for other purposes or if you have intentionally directed us to share information with a third party. In addition, with your approval, we share certain internet tracking data, including cookies and the IP address used to access our websites.
    
* _Notice of Financial Incentive:_
    
    Moderna does not offer financial incentives in exchange for the collection or sale of personal data. However, we do provide discounts and incentives to individuals who use our products and services and enroll in incentive programs that we offer from time to time; enrolling in these programs requires you to provide certain of your personal data so that we may administer the programs and, in some cases, provide marketing and advertising to you. Under CCPA, this could be considered an offer of a “financial incentive” and so we provide this notice to you to describe our practice and to provide a good faith estimate of the value of your personal data that we may collect related to the programs.  
      
    In the normal course of our business, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal data, but in accordance with CCPA, we make a good faith estimate that the value of the personal data collected and used is equivalent to the value of the discount or financial incentive we provide in these programs. To make this good faith estimate, we may consider among other factors, the (i) categories of personal data collected, (ii) the discount or incentive offered, (iii) the sales or use of our products and services by those who enroll versus those who do not, and (iv) the cost and expenses we incur in offering the programs.  
      
    The incentive programs require you to opt-in to participate as set forth on the page where you can enroll or opt-in to the programs. You can opt-out either by contacting us at the information set forth below, or by following the terms and conditions provided when you are enrolling in the program. While we will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under CCPA, if you request deletion of your personal data, we may not be able to delete such information if it is necessary to administer the incentive or discount you requested and still provide you such incentive or discount.

You may make such a request at any time, by visiting our [request web page](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/bd5eb8a9-9d4b-487d-be7b-36a09d769cc1/fa10399c-b928-423c-8494-5a5c6d72f95a).

It is not technologically possible to remove from our servers each and every record of your information.

Nevertheless, when permitted by law, Moderna will delete your personal data (including health information) stored in the databases Moderna actively uses for research and daily business activities or stored in other readily searchable media.

##### _How We Manage Disclosure of Transfers of Value_

Moderna collects data about the transfers of value that you have received from us so that we can comply with our obligations under the IPHA Code, specifically that companies must document and publicly disclose annually certain transfers of value made directly or indirectly to health professionals and other relevant decision makers located in Europe.

Moderna recognizes the legitimate public interest in better understanding the financial relationships that healthcare professionals have with the pharmaceutical industry for the purposes of transparency and trust in the pharmaceutical industry.

The law requires us to inform you of the legal basis for collecting and processing your personal data where Moderna is the data controller. Where Moderna processes data relating to transfers of value made to you, Moderna relies on the legal basis of legitimate interests to process that data. Moderna’s compliance with the IPHA Code and these further objectives cannot be met without processing personal data about you and the transfers of value that you have received from us. We have carried out a Legitimate Interests Assessment and consider that this processing is necessary, proportionate and without unjustified harm to you.

If you do not agree to the disclosure of data relating to transfers of value made to you by Moderna, you can raise an objection via [privacy@modernatx.com](mailto:privacy@modernatx.com).
