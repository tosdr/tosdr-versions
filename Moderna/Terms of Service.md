The Website contains express or implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that are based on beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to Moderna’s management. These statements relate to, among other things, Moderna’s expectations regarding plans, objectives, strategies, future operating or financial performance, business plans and prospects, and expectations regarding clinical trials, development timelines, discussions with regulatory authorities, development programs, development candidates and investigational medicines under development by Moderna and by Moderna’s strategic collaborators. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Such statements are based on Moderna’s management’s current expectations and are subject to certain factors, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in such statements. The information presented on the Website is believed to be current as of the date of its original publication.
