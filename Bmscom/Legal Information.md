| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-14-with-who-we-share-info-with.png) | 9\. WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION |

As a multinational company operating worldwide, your Personal Information may be shared with, or accessed by, parties located outside your country of residence. If you are located outside of the United States, BMS may share your Personal Information with parties located in countries that provide less protection than in your country, which includes the United States. We may also Process and share your Personal Information with some of our affiliates and other members of the BMS group including selected and approved third parties (vendors and business partners) that help us operate worldwide. When doing so, we implement appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access or Use of your Personal Information.

Below you can find more information about how BMS shares your Personal Information within its group of entities and with third parties.

_Sharing your Personal Information within the BMS group_

Often, we share your Personal Information within the BMS group of companies (“**BMS Group**”). This may include the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company headquarters in the United States and all of its current and future subsidiaries, branch offices, affiliates, entities and other companies that are part of, owned or controlled by, the BMS Group. When exchanging information internally, we rely on appropriate arrangements and mechanisms to cover any transfer of your Personal Information within our corporate structure, such as binding corporate rules (BCRs), contractual arrangements approved by authorities or based on consent.

_Sharing your Personal Information with third parties_

To conduct our business, we share with, or disclose Personal Information to, third parties, such as:

* **Third-party service providers** for the purpose of outsourcing specific business activities to request external support and resources. This may include companies that provide information technology services, clinical trials and studies support, marketing or market research services, events, meeting and planning services, or services related to talent acquisition or consultancy;
* **business partners** such as external scientists and healthcare professionals to review and assist us with healthcare compliance activities and institutions and other organizations with whom we collaborate to support our clinical or commercial activities (such as for clinical studies, patient support programs, and so on);  
    
* **digital advertising companies**, such as advertising networks or platforms that help us understand how which of our products or programs you are most likely to be interested in learning about; 
* **regulatory and health authorities** including governmental bodies (such as the FDA, EMA, NHS), data protection authorities, tax authorities, or courts in case of disputes, when permitted or required by Applicable Data Protection Law; and
* **third parties to whom BMS is legally obligated to provide such information,** such as other parties in litigation or legal disputes, guardians, conservators, or individuals with powers of attorney.

_Data sharing in connection with a transfer of control_

Circumstances may arise where we decide to reorganize or divest part or all of our business or a line of our business (or any portion of our assets), including our information databases and websites, through a sale, divestiture, merger, acquisition, in the event of a bankruptcy, or other means of transfer. In any such circumstance, your Personal Information may be shared with, sold, transferred, rented, licensed, or otherwise provided or made available by us or on our behalf to actual or potential parties to, and in connection with, the contemplated transaction (without your consent or any further notice to you). In such circumstances, we will seek written assurances that Personal Information about you submitted through this Website will be protected appropriately.

_If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-15-erope.png) | Whenever we transfer your Personal Information within the EEA, Switzerland or to countries that are deemed “adequate”, such countries are deemed to offer the same level of protection as given by the law of your country. When accessing your Personal Data from, or transferring it, **outside of the EEA** **or Switzerland** to countries that **may not provide the same level of protection as your own country,** we will use appropriate safeguards to protect your right to privacy. For example, such safeguards may consist of using Standard Contractual Clauses (to exchange information with third parties outside of the EEA and Switzerland), Binding Corporate Rules (for data transfer within the BMS group of companies) as approved by the European Commission or the competent authority, data transfer agreements or your consent. |

_If you are outside the EEA and Switzerland_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-16-outside-efa.png) | Where possible, we will allow access to or the transfer of your Personal Information outside your country of residence:<br><br>* to countries that provide a reasonable high level of data protection;<br>* using the most appropriate data transfer mechanisms available to BMS; or<br>* where required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, after we get your prior permission, for the collection, disclosure to third parties and the transfer of your Personal Information to a country which does not provide an adequate protection equivalent to the laws of your country of residence. |

We may use algorithms that will enable us to use automated decision-making, including to create profiles. This means that when we use certain technologies, software or algorithms, which may allow us to create profiles, tiering, further understand trends and statistics or use other advanced technologies or automated processing, someone will be involved to validate decisions resulting from such use.  
  
We do not use profiles to make any decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, such as the provision or denial of financial or lending services, housing, insurance, education enrollment or opportunity, criminal justice, employment opportunities, health-care services, or access to essential goods or services.

You have a number of rights related to the Personal Data that we Process about you (this will depend on the jurisdiction where you reside and the legal basis that we use). Most often, exercising your right is free of charge. We may also have to clarify your request and explain if we can comply with it or if this is restricted in your situation. You can always contact BMS at [dpo@bms.com](mailto:%20dpo@bms.com) or via this [contact form](https://www.bms.com/about-us/contact-us.html) to find out more about your rights and how best to exercise them.

**_Exceptions to your rights_**

There may be exceptions to your privacy rights described in this Notice. This depends on the country where you reside, why we are Processing your Personal Data and if your request may impair the rights of others. If we cannot comply with your request to exercise your privacy rights, for example when we keep your information for regulatory purposes or for the investigation, prosecution, or defence of a legal claim, we will explain this to you when you contact us.

**Example** 

If you ask BMS to stop sending you marketing communications by e-mail, we may keep your e-mail address and other contact details in case we conduct other activities with you, such as when we have a contract with you or if we have a legal or a regulatory obligation to keep your contact details.

_**How to contact us**_

If you have any questions about how we Use your Personal Information, please contact our Data Protection Office at [dpo@bms.com](mailto:dpo@bms.com). If you are resident in a State that provides you with more rights (such as California), you can submit requests by calling 855-961-0474 or by completing the online form at [www.bms.com/dpo/us/request](https://www.bms.com/dpo/us/request.html). For further details, see our section on [State Privacy Rights](#general16).

**Note:** We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. If your request is complex or if you have made a large number of requests, it may take us longer to respond to you, but we will keep you informed of any delays. You will not have to pay a fee to obtain a copy of your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.

_**Lodging a complaint with a competent authority**_

In some countries, you may have the right to lodge a complaint to the relevant data protection or competent authority if you believe that we Process your Personal Information unlawfully or are violating your rights. For example, in the European Union, you can access the list of competent data protection authorities, including the authority in your country of residence by clicking [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en) or by visiting: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-18-how-long-we-retain-your-info.png) | 12\. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION |

We aim not to retain your Personal Information for longer than necessary for the specific business purposes for which it was collected. After that, unless we are required to continue to maintain the information by law, we may anonymize, restrict, block or delete it. In certain cases, BMS may retain your Personal Information for a longer period for the purpose that we have and, in a manner, or a format, that may require BMS to keep certain identifiers. In such case, we may archive it and apply appropriate measures which may consist of blocking, preventing, obfuscating, pseudonymizing, key-coding, or restricting any further access and Use of Personal Information about you. When retaining and storing information about you in our systems, we have put in place data retention schedules in accordance with our company policy and in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.

When assessing the appropriate retention period, we take into account the quantity, nature and sensitivity of Personal Data, the potential risk of harm in the event of unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes of the Processing and whether or not these purposes can be achieved by other means, as well as applicable legal obligations.

| --- | --- |
| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-19-how-do-we-protect-your-info.png) | 13\. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION |

We implement appropriate technical and organizational controls to protect your Personal Information that we hold to prevent unauthorized Processing, loss of data, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction.  Where appropriate, we use encryption, pseudonymisation (such as key coding), de-identification and other technologies that can assist us in securing the information about you, including measures to restore access to your information. We also require our service providers to comply with reasonable and recognized data privacy and security requirements. 

We conduct tests and reviews of our technologies and processes, including a review of our business partners and vendors, so that our security controls remain effective. Also, we may further anonymize your Personal Information when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which BMS originally collected such Information.

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-20-apply-to-work.png) | 14\. APPLYING TO WORK AT BMS |

BMS may Process your Personal Data to evaluate your application to work at BMS. When applying for an opportunity at BMS, we may collect and Process Personal Information about you directly or indirectly from our official websites, third parties or when you make this information publicly available or accessible by third parties for recruitment purposes. You can consult our career opportunities on this page: [https://careers.bms.com/](https://careers.bms.com/). Below, you can find more information about how BMS Processes your Personal Information when you apply to work for us. 

_To consider your application we may collect:_

* **your professional experience,** such as job title, education information, professional qualifications, work experience, publications, and professional networks, programs and activities in which you participated;
* **your contact details,** such as your e-mail address, full name, date of birth and other information necessary to submit your application;
* **information gathered from agencies**, such as information from recruitment agencies, reference providers, and (where permitted by law) background screening providers;
* **publicly available information from** a company website, internet searches or social media platforms such as LinkedIn or other social media platforms, and publicly available profile information (such as your experience, skills, and interests);
* **information that you allow us to access**, for example, if you choose to simplify your login Process to the job platform to allow direct access once you have signed in to your third party social media user account, (such as Gmail or Yahoo!), or if you want to upload information to the platform (such as from LinkedIn) instead of manually completing an application; and
* **other information** that you submit to us, that we obtain indirectly or that we access when looking for new hires or career opportunities.

_As your job application proceeds_

We may ask you to share additional Personal Information with us, such as:

* **official information,** such as government issued identification number or tax status; 
* **financial information**, such as bank account details;
* **special categories of Personal Data / sensitive Personal Data**, including (where it is permitted, necessary or required for your application) information about your health, marital status, trade union membership religion, criminal records, or credit worthiness data; or

_Where do we Use your Personal Information for job application_

As a multinational organization, our affiliates transfer information globally. When you upload information to a job search platform, you provide it to all our affiliates, each of which may Process it for its own recruitment purposes. This is the case even where you respond to a job posting that mentions a particular BMS affiliate. Accordingly, we may transfer globally information about you (for example, if you are in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), your information may be transferred outside the EEA; if you are in Australia, your information may be transferred outside Australia).

We will not keep your Personal Information for longer than needed to consider your application. However, we may ask your permission to keep some information about you for a longer period (for example your CV or resume, work experience, cover letters and so on) to consider your eligibility for further job opportunities.

**Note, this section, together with this Notice, does not apply to participants to clinical trials.** 

This Notice applies to how BMS may Use Personal Information about you when you participate in non-clinical activities. If you are involved in a research project, clinical trial or in a study you can contact your physician or contact [dpo@bms.com](mailto:dpo@bms.com).

* anonymizing your Personal Information after its collection; or

In this section, we describe our legal justifications (commonly referred to as “legal basis”) for the Use of your Personal Information related to each of our main Processing activities. We will use the legal basis that is most appropriate for the purpose and circumstances related to such Processing. Below, we have explained which legal bases we may choose or have to use when Using your Personal Information.  

There may be times where we must use your consent to Process your Personal Information. We may also decide to ask your permission to Process your Personal Data, such as in the context of voluntary initiatives or activities. 

**Please note:** depending on the country where you reside, the law of your country may not require that BMS use a specific legal basis to justify Using your Personal Information, including transfers of your Personal Information outside your country (for example in the United States). However, when Applicable Data Protection Law requires a legal basis, we will inform you about what legal basis we use at the time of the collection or when we communicate with you. If your jurisdiction requires consent to Process your Personal Information when you interact with us, we will obtain your consent prior to the Use of such Information.

In the following table, you can read more details about what applicable legal basis or combination of legal bases we may use when Processing your Personal Information.

| **Our legal bases** | **Examples of activities that we conduct with your Personal Information** |

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-14-with-who-we-share-info-with.png) | 9\. WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION |

As a multinational company operating worldwide, your Personal Information may be shared with, or accessed by, parties located outside your country of residence. If you are located outside of the United States, BMS may share your Personal Information with parties located in countries that provide less protection than in your country, which includes the United States. We may also Process and share your Personal Information with some of our affiliates and other members of the BMS group including selected and approved third parties (vendors and business partners) that help us operate worldwide. When doing so, we implement appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access or Use of your Personal Information.  

Below you can find more information about how BMS shares your Personal Information within its group of entities and with third parties.

_Sharing your Personal Information within the BMS group_

Often, we share your Personal Information within the BMS group of companies (**“BMS Group”**). This may include the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company headquarters in the United States and all of its current and future subsidiaries, branch offices, affiliates, entities and other companies that are part of, owned or controlled by, the BMS Group. When exchanging information internally, we rely on appropriate arrangements and mechanisms to cover any transfer of your Personal Information within our corporate structure, such as binding corporate rules (BCRs), contractual arrangements approved by authorities or based on consent.

_Sharing your Personal Information with third parties_

To conduct our business, we share with, or disclose Personal Information to, third parties, such as:

* **Third-party service providers** for the purpose of outsourcing specific business activities to request external support and resources. This may include companies that provide information technology services, clinical trials and studies support, marketing or market research services, events, meeting and planning services, or services related to talent acquisition or consultancy;
* **business partners** such as external scientists and healthcare professionals to review and assist us with healthcare compliance activities and institutions and other organizations with whom we collaborate to support our clinical or commercial activities (such as for clinical studies, patient support programs, and so on);
* **Regulatory and health authorities** including governmental bodies (such as the FDA, EMA, NHS), data protection authorities, tax authorities, or courts in case of disputes, when permitted or required by Applicable Data Protection Law; and
* **third parties to whom BMS is legally obligated to provide such information,** such as other parties in litigation or legal disputes, guardians, conservators, or individuals with powers of attorney. 

When engaging with third parties, we enter into agreements with them for the Processing of Personal Data so that such Processing is carried out in accordance with our instructions, in a confidential, secure, and transparent manner in order to protect your privacy rights. When it is not possible to enter into an agreement with a third party, such as when engaging, reporting or interacting with regulatory or health authorities or courts, and when legally possible, we will use our best efforts to implement appropriate security measures and controls (such as pseudonymisation) to protect your Personal Information.

_Data sharing in connection with a transfer of control_

Circumstances may arise where we decide to reorganize or divest part or all of our business or a line of our business (or any portion of our assets), including our information databases and websites, through a sale, divestiture, merger, acquisition, in the event of a bankruptcy, or other means of transfer. In any such circumstance, your Personal Information may be shared with, sold, transferred, rented, licensed, or otherwise provided or made available by us or on our behalf to actual or potential parties to, and in connection with, the contemplated transaction (without your consent or any further notice to you). In such circumstances, we will seek written assurances that Personal Information about you submitted through this Website will be protected appropriately.

_If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland and the United Kingdom_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-15-erope.png) | Whenever we transfer your Personal Information within the EEA, Switzerland or to countries that are deemed “adequate”, such countries are deemed to offer the same level of protection as given by the law of your country. When accessing your Personal Data from, or transferring it, **outside of the EEA or Switzerland** to countries that **may not provide the same level of protection as your own country**, we will use appropriate safeguards to protect your right to privacy. For example, such safeguards may consist of using Standard Contractual Clauses (to exchange information with third parties outside of the EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), Binding Corporate Rules (for data transfer within the BMS group of companies) as approved by the European Commission or the competent authority, data transfer agreements or your consent. |

_If you are outside the EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-16-outside-efa.png) | Where possible, we will allow access to or the transfer of your Personal Information outside your country of residence:<br><br>* to countries that provide a reasonable high level of data protection;<br>* using the most appropriate data transfer mechanisms available to BMS; or<br>* where required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, after we get your prior permission, for the collection, disclosure to third parties and the transfer of your Personal Information to a country which does not provide an adequate protection equivalent to the laws of your country of residence. |

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-10-automated-decision-making.png) | 10\. CLASSIFICATION, AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND INDIVIDUALS’ RIGHTS |

BMS may combine your Personal Data with other information we may already have about you or obtained through public means such as scientific and medical publications, national registries, software, databases, or the Internet. We may also carry out internal assessments, evaluations, categorization, classification, raking or ratings of your activities, and/or your institution or site’s performance, including analytics (where applicable). Below, we provide you with additional information about how we categorize or classify your Personal Data.

We may use algorithms or third-party data sources to tier HCPs according to your research activity (including publications) and skills (such as years of experience and qualifications). Where permitted by Applicable Data Protection Law, applicable rates for speaking and event participation are set according to the tiering of HCPs. 

Unless permitted by law, **BMS does not make decisions based solely on automated Processing (including profiling) of individual data unless we inform you otherwise prior to the Processing.** This means that when we use certain technologies, software, or algorithms, which may allow us to create profiles, tiering or further understand trends and statistics, or use other advanced technologies or automated processing, someone will be involved to validate decisions resulting from such use. 

As the use of such technologies evolves, we may use algorithms without a person involved in the decision. In this case, if this activity requires us to Process your Personal Information that is not anonymized, we will comply with any applicable legal requirements, such as to draw this to your attention and provide you with information about the logic involved in the decision, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences for you of such Use of your Personal Information. Depending on your country of residence, you will have the right to ask that such decision is taken by an individual.

You will not have to pay a fee to obtain a copy of your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.

**_Lodging a complaint with a competent supervisory authority_**

In some countries, you may have the right to lodge a complaint to the relevant data protection or competent authority if you believe that we Process your Personal Information unlawfully or are violating your rights.

We aim not to retain your Personal Information for longer than necessary for the specific business purposes for which it was collected. After that, unless we are required to continue to maintain the information by law, we may anonymize, restrict, block or delete it. 

In certain cases, BMS may retain your Personal Information for a longer period for the purpose that we have and, in a manner, or a format, that may require BMS to keep certain identifiers. In such case, we may archive it and apply appropriate measures which may consist of blocking, preventing, obfuscating, pseudonymizing, key-coding, or restricting any further access and Use of Personal Information about you. When retaining and storing information about you in our systems, we have put in place data retention schedules in accordance with our company policy and in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws. 

When assessing the appropriate retention period, we take into account the quantity, nature and sensitivity of Personal Data, the potential risk of harm in the event of unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes of the Processing and whether or not these purposes can be achieved by other means, as well as applicable legal obligations.

We also require our service providers to comply with reasonable and recognized data privacy and security requirements. 

We conduct tests and reviews of our technologies and processes, including a review of our business partners and vendors, so that our security controls remain effective. Also, we may further anonymize your Personal Information when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which BMS originally collected such Information.

_Why do we use cookies on our website?_

In addition to the explanation provided in this Notice and the section above, we use cookies or similar tracking technologies in various instances, such as for the following purposes:

* **Making your experience more efficient, faster and easier:** by remembering your preferences, like preferred language, display and other settings, maintaining your session, and for authentication purposes. This helps us to provide you with a better user experience. These cookies are also referred to as Session-Id cookies, authentication cookies, and User Interface customization cookies.
* **Gain useful knowledge about how the website is used:** by collecting information about the number of visitors and other uses. This helps us improve our websites. These cookies are also referred to as analytics cookies. For this purpose, we use services such as Google Analytics which means that Google and similar suppliers will also have access to this information (including your IP address and any other equipment identifiers such as the IMEI number and the MAC address). 
* **Provide easy access to our websites.** This helps us to direct you, share with you our content within websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube or Pinterest or allow you to share content that is of your interest. To the extent we use such technology, these ‘social media plug-ins’ may store cookies and similar technology on your computer or other device. This means that the social media websites may access this information (including your IP address), may identify that you interacted with the BMS website. 
* **Improve our marketing communications to you.** Certain cookies, such as web beacons or tracking pixels, may be used by third party systems, such as customer relationship management systems or other service providers who help us manage e-mail campaigns. Those trackers enable us to better understand the success of our communications and the relevance of the content that we share with you. This may allow us to reduce the number of e-mails that we send you and provide you with content, scientific information, or initiatives that are more tailored to your interests.
* **Collect and analyse advertising campaigns.** We use, and allow certain 3rd parties to use, other technologies, such as web beacons, on our Websites and in our digital communications to tailor advertising, or to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. A web beacon is a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) that a company can place on a website or in digital communications to allow it or a third party (such as an Internet advertising, audience measurement, or social media company). As a result, we and these 3rd parties may collect and use information about your online visits to our Websites or engagement with our digital communications.   

_How can you object or refuse cookies?_

Subject to the law of your country, in particular in the European Union, we will either inform you, ask your prior permission (opt-in) before placing tracking technologies on your device, or provide you with a right to object (opt-out) for the purposes that we describe in this section. Your web browser, e-mail software (such as Microsoft outlook, or Google Gmail) and other clients that you use can be set to manage cookies and similar trackers and even reject them by default. Do bear in mind that if you set your browser to automatically reject cookies, your user experience when visiting websites will not be the same: your preferences may not be remembered, some functionality may be lost and you may not be able to access certain areas or features of the websites.

These 3rd parties collect and store data about your interests based on your online and mobile activity using different technologies, such as placing or recognizing cookies on your browser, recognizing device identifiers, or using pixel tags.

In some cases, the 3rd parties we work with may still collect data about your browsing activity and mobile application activity for other purposes but will not use this information to select our ads that you see.

You should review the privacy policies of those properties to learn more about how you can opt-out of interest-based ads on those websites. 

_Retargeting_

The data captured through the tracking technologies used by our Websites may be shared with our 3rd party advertising technology partners in order to provide you with targeted advertising that may appear on other websites you visit on the internet.

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn_controller_of_data.png) | ##### 1\. INTRODUCTION – HOW TO READ THIS NOTICE |

In this Notice, we provide you with an overview of how and why we collect your personal data - also known as personal information. We also inform you about your privacy rights related to our use of your data.

You should read this Employee Notice in combination with the BMS [General Privacy Notice](https://www.bms.com/privacy-policy.html#general) which explains the collective privacy standards and commitments that apply to all processing of personal data at BMS. It is available on the footer of our corporate [www.bms.com](http://www.bms.com/) websites for markets where we have a presence or operate.

| **Before you start reading this Notice** |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Who is the audience?** | **This notice applies:**  <br>  <br><br>* **during your contract and after its termination**, as a new hire, a current or past worker, including an employee, consultant or autonomous worker, retiree;<br>* **to contractors**, such as interns, agency workers, consultants; and  <br>    <br>* **to third parties** whose information is provided to us in connection with the employment or work relationship (for example, referees or emergency contact information). |
| **Country-specific notices** | As a supplement to this notice, there may be country specific BMS documentation covering individual country laws or processes that might impact the use of your personal data at your specific work location. These documents can be accessed through your local intranet or HR business partner. |
| **Relevance of my personal data** | The nature and the categories of the personal data that BMS processes about you can differ, depending on your role and your relationship with BMS. We try to point out these differences where possible but if there are processing activities specific to your role at BMS or to the country where you reside, we will provide you with additional ‘point in time data’ wherever possible. |

**Example:** Most processing activities related to BMS employee benefits are not applicable to consultants, contractors, interns, agency workers or autonomous workers who are employed by third parties and then contracted by BMS. This notice covers personal data that BMS _controls and processes_. Contractors and consultants should therefore review privacy notices provided by their own employers to understand how their data is processed.

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn_onboarding2.png) | ##### 2\. WHO IS THE CONTROLLER OF YOUR DATA |

A controller decides why and how to process your personal data. However, central teams at BMS located in another country (for example, teams in the US and support services provided by our authorized business partners) may also access and process your personal data as described in this notice. For each activity, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its affiliates will act as controller together or jointly for using your data.

**Note**: If you have an employment contract, the BMS legal entity who is your employer, or who has the contract with your employer, is the controller of your personal data. If you are a consultant, contractor, intern or independent worker), then the entity listed in your employer’s contract with BMS is the controller.

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn-13-how-bms-dustifies-using-your-info.png) | ##### 8\. OUR LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA |

In this section, we describe our legal justifications (commonly referred to as “legal basis”) for the use of your data related to each of purpose for using it. We will use the legal basis that is most appropriate for the purpose and circumstances related to such processing. Below, we have explained which legal bases we may choose or have to use when using your personal information.

**Note:** Depending on the country or State where you reside, the law of your country may not require that BMS justifies how it uses your data (such as in the US or Hong-Kong). This applies to ordinary use of your data, transfers outside of your residence, or when sharing or disclosing your Work-Related Data with a third party. If you are from a jurisdiction or a State that requires a legal basis for processing personal data (such as China, the EEA, UK, or Brazil), our legal basis will depend on the personal data concerned and the context in which we collect it. Where required by applicable law, BMS will obtain your prior consent for certain processing activities – for example, using cookies or trackers, when using your images or recording materials, disclosing your personal data outside of your country of residence or disclosing it with BMS-approved third parties.

* * *

  |     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![Read More](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/read-more.png) | **Specific examples of usual legal bases** |

BMS relies on a legal basis for each of our processing activities for most of the jurisdictions where BMS operates, whether relating to Work Related Data or Sensitive Work Related data. However, the privacy laws in some countries may not require the same legal basis for our processing activities as we have described in this notice. For instance, we may use consent or contractual necessity instead of legitimate interest when the local law does not recognize such a legal concept.

Our most used legal bases are:

* **contractual necessity**: in practice, this means that BMS needs to process your data to honor our commitments as stated in your arrangement with BMS, for example providing your personal data to our third-party payroll, pension or insurance provider;
* **compliance with a legal obligation**: there are many times where BMS has a legal obligation to use, retain or disclose your Work Related Data. We will make this clear at the time and inform you whether provision of your personal data is mandatory or not, as well as the possible consequences if it is not provided;
* **prior consent**: where BMS conducts optional activities or when the law requires it, we will inform you and BMS may require your **prior consent**. Unless the nature of the activity or of the data requires it, your local law prescribes or allows otherwise, you will have the right to withdraw your consent at any time;
* **public disclosures**: if you agree to disclose your Work Related Data publicly or if BMS has a duty to do so, then future control over that data may be compromised. BMS will provide you with a notice explaining the processing activity where your personal data may become publicly available and if you have a choice of whether to participate or not.  
      
    

| **Legal basis** | **Description and examples when using our legal basis** |
| --- | --- |
| **Performance of a contract with you** | In most cases, we justify using your data for **HR management** as described in our HR related policies, handbooks and other rules that may apply to your role at BMS.  <br>  <br>**Example**: Compensation & benefits, performance, ensuring compliance with employee handbooks, SOPs, internal procedures, for sick leave, internal career development and opportunities, running our daily operations, login to and use our IT systems. |

This includes sharing your Work Related Data with third parties or competent authorities or bodies. |
| **Legitimate interest or use** | BMS has legitimate interests to use your personal data for identified purposes, always assessing that there is an appropriate balance between your right to privacy and BMS’s interest to conduct its business operations.  <br>  <br>In general, BMS considers it has a legitimate interest to use your Work related Data to achieve its immediate and long-term business and commercial goals and outcomes, such as in the context of:  <br>  <br><br>* recruitment and candidate selection, HR management;<br>* protecting our work case management, running investigations to evaluate misconducts or non-compliance with internal policies or procedures, retaining data for protecting against claims and disputes, business continuity, pension or retirement administration;<br>* celebrations of special occasions (recognizing years of service, birthday), using intranets, corporate directories, make your BMS profile available internally or to our approved third parties;<br>* prevention and detection of data loss, crime or fraud;<br>* manage and forecasting our finances;<br>* conduct surveys, analytics, improve facility accesses, workforce optimization, security of our systems or prevent data losses.<br><br>  <br>**Note**:  BMS uses its legitimate interest when it is proportionate, aligned to, or would not conflict with, your reasonable expectations, and does not undermine your individual rights, interests or freedoms. |
| **Consent** | In the context of voluntary initiatives or benefits where we obtain your **prior permission** to use or share your personal data for a specific activity, such as events, picture or recordings, connecting to third party platforms or services. |
| **Public interest** | To protect against serious diseases or threats in the context of global, regional, or national public health, for instances in the event of pandemic situations. In most cases, accessing or disclosing your personal data in this context will be based directly on applicable laws. |
| **Vital interest** | On rare occasions, we use your vital interest to protect your, or the vital interest of third parties, for accident, security or to prevent imminent threats to your or third parties’ health and safety at the workplace or outside our premises for emergencies or insurance purposes. |

| ![](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/icn_ai.png) | ##### 9\. DO WE USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) OR SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES? |

BMS has developed internal policies and guidance on responsible use of AI. When using AI tools involving Work-Related Data, we will apply globally recognized data privacy & protection principles. When using third party technology, we ensure to apply:

(i) BMS principles on responsible use of AI;  
(ii) appropriate technical and security measures;  
(iii) contractual arrangement to protect your personal data.

BMS will provide you with more detailed information in a privacy notice, and if required, obtain your prior consent before using such technologies. You can read more information about your rights, including your right to object or to request human intervention, in [section 10](#right).

  |     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![Read More](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/read-more.png) | **More information and examples of our use of digital technologies** |

Currently, BMS does not use technologies that qualify as Artificial Intelligence (AI) when using worker personal data, such as algorithms that have a sufficient degree of autonomy to make important or significant decisions about you in the context of work without human oversight before any decision is made. In other words, BMS does not use such technologies without decisions being made by humans which can affect you as a BMS worker.

However, we do use certain tools and technologies that allow us to improve efficiency in our daily operations. BMS is looking at digital solutions, automation and advanced technologies that can:

* **reduce manual tasks**, to support our operations and drive efficiency at work;
* **improve your well-being**, safety at the workplace, mental health;
* **assess risk profiles** to comply with internal BMS policies and applicable laws, such for, anti-bribery, drug promotion or preventing conflict of interest;
* **protect BMS systems**, including in the context of cybersecurity or data loss prevention programs;
* **facilitate the** **selection of potential candidates** for recruiters’ review when applying on our official careers website: [https://www.careers.bms.com](https://www.careers.bms.com/);
* **send** **automated instant messages** and communications through intranet or online chatbots, calendar scheduling bots, or other online technologies. Internal chatbots may use our enterprise directory to refer our teams to the appropriate subject matter experts;
* **match your BMS profile** for career development opportunities.  
     

**Example**: BMS may use machine learning solutions that can enable career or learning opportunities at BMS, on a voluntary basis, including to suggest internal projects, reach assignments, tour of duties or job opportunities that match your profile and to propose boosting your career at BMS.

We do this to prevent unauthorised processing, loss of data, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction of your personal data. The measures that we deploy are dependent on the sensitivity of the personal data and the most recent advancements made in security technology. Where appropriate, we use encryption, pseudonymisation (such as key coding), de-identification and other technologies that can assist us in securing your data, including measures to restore access to your data. We also require our service providers to comply with reasonable and recognized data privacy and security requirements.

| ![Read More](/assets/bms/us/en-us/icons/read-more.png) | **The measures we use to protect your data** | 

Bristol Myers Squibb has adopted the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** ([https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework "https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework")) to ensure that our most critical information is kept confidential, suitably available, and safeguarded from corruption. Aligning with NIST also allows us to continuously assess and improve our ability to protect, detect, and respond to cyberattacks.  NIST defines five cybersecurity functions:  identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.  We have aligned our cybersecurity program to these five functions.

We conduct regular testing and reviews of our technologies and processes, including auditing of our business partners and vendors, so that our security controls remain effective and up to date. Also, we may further anonymize your personal data when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which BMS originally collected it.

**Criteria to keep your data**

Typically, we retain data based on the following criteria, where we consider:

* the quantity, nature and sensitivity of the personal data in question;
* the potential risk of harm in the event of unauthorised use or disclosure;

For example, when BMS must retain data for a set minimum period or to delete it after a set maximum time limit. Some common examples of these obligations normally relate to data needed for tax and accounting, anti-bribery, conflict of interest or investigation purposes.
