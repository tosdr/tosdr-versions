Your California Privacy Rights
------------------------------

_Shine the Light._ If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to learn how your “personal information” (as defined in the Shine the Light Law, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83) is shared with third-parties, what categories of personal information we have shared with third-parties in the preceding year, as well as the names and addresses of those third-parties, please e-mail us at: [care@nationalinjurybureau.com](mailto:care@nationalinjurybureau.com); call us at: (833) 757-0886; or send us U.S. Mail to: 300 Carlsbad Village Dr. 108A-516, Carlsbad, CA 92008.

Further, if you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third-party for marketing purposes, please e-mail us at: [care@nationalinjurybureau.com](mailto:care@nationalinjurybureau.com); call us at: (833) 757-0886; or send us U.S. Mail to: 300 Carlsbad Village Dr. 108A-516, Carlsbad, CA 92008. Please be advised that where California State residents opt-out from permitting their personal information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from us, in accordance with applicable law.

_California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”)._ In addition to the foregoing, if you are a resident of the State of California, certain other privacy-related rights may apply to you in accordance with the CCPA, including the right to opt-out of our sale of your personal information, as well as the right to know what personal information about you we have collected, whether your personal information was shared with third-parties in the preceding year and, if so, what categories of personal information were shared, as well as the categories of third parties with whom we shared that personal information. Please see our “[Privacy Provisions for California Residents](https://rounduprisk.com/ccpa/)” below for a more complete description of your rights under the CCPA as a California State resident.

In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want her/his personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for interest-based advertising. As required by California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”), we are required to inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or alter our behavior when a Site User has activated the “do-not-track” setting on her/his browser.

How We Use Personal Information
-------------------------------

Use and Sharing of Personal Information
---------------------------------------

Please see our [Privacy Provisions for California Residents](https://rounduprisk.com/ccpa/) below for details regarding our use and sharing of personal information.

By submitting your personal information by and through the Site Offerings, you agree that we may share, sell, rent, lease or otherwise provide that personal information (other than Sensitive Information) to any third party for any purpose permitted by law, and we may work with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our Users. These businesses and third parties may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; (c) telemarketers (where permitted by applicable law); and (d) direct marketers. We will also use your personal information to send you promotional messages regarding various Company products and/or services, as well as third party products and/or services that we think may be of interest to you.

Without limiting the foregoing, upon entering personal information and clicking on the applicable submission button on the Site, Company may pass your personal information (including Sensitive Information) along to one (1) or more of Company’s Third-Party Legal Professionals.

We may also employ third parties and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf, including helping us operate the Site Offerings and/or to administer related activities on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from User lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our Users’ personal information as needed to perform their functions for us, but we do not permit them to use User personal information for other purposes.

Additionally, we purchase and manage e-mail lists generated by third parties. Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present and available at the end of each piece of e-mail that we send.

We will also use your personal information for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you through the Site Offerings. We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other sources.

By registering at the Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.

Where you provide “prior express consent” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC § 227), and its implementing regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR § 64.1200), as amended from time-to-time (“TCPA“), you consent to receive telephone calls from Company and any specified Third-Party Provider(s), including artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls (including SMS text messages) delivered via automated technology, to the telephone number(s) that you provided. Please note that you are not required to provide this consent in order to obtain access to the Site Offerings, and your consent simply allows Company and any specified Third-Party Legal Professional(s) to contact you via these means. **Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are obligated to immediately inform us if and when the telephone number that you have previously provided to us changes. Without limiting the foregoing, if you: (a) have your telephone number reassigned to another person or entity; (b) give up your telephone number so that it is no longer used by you; (c) port your telephone number to a landline or vice versa; or (d) otherwise stop using that telephone number for any reason (collectively “Phone Number Change”), you agree that you shall promptly notify Company of the Phone Number Change via e-mail at: [care@nationalinjurybureau.com](mailto:care@nationalinjurybureau.com), or by using one of the methods set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.**

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all personal information with/to any third party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collection and Use
----------------------------------------------------------

Please see our [Privacy Provisions for California Residents](https://rounduprisk.com/ccpa/) below for more details regarding the categories and types of non-personal information collected.

Demographic Information and Aggregate Data
------------------------------------------

Aggregate and demographic data is data that describes the demographics, usage or characteristics of our Users as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. We use demographic information to tailor the Site Offerings to the interests of our Users. Demographic information is shared with third party advertisers so that they can tailor their advertisements to the appropriate audience. Demographic information may also be shared with other third parties.

We reserve the right to provide aggregate data about our Users for lawful purposes. By agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any aggregate data, record or communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate.

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Site and to better serve you in using the products, services and other features contained within the Site.

Cookies and Action Tags
-----------------------

Cookies
-------

The first time that a User provides an e-mail address in connection with her/his activities at the Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the applicable User’s PC. Whenever that User comes back to the Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the User and to recall the User’s e-mail address.

If, at any time, a User provides other information in connection with her/his activities on the Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with the User’s e-mail address, in our User database. We may use the information stored in our database: (a) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a User; (b) to pre-populate information fields in the event that User wishes to purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other offers in the future; (c) to ensure that a User will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Site; and/or (d) to, in connection with regular communication with a User, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that User.

To find out more about cookies, please visit [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).

We reserve the right to retain this cookie data indefinitely, and to share information generated by these cookies with our advertisers, affiliates and service providers.

Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods

An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements and/or other information on the Site. Action tags are 1×1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of the Site and to provide information about what products/services are viewed or purchased. We reserve the right to retain this action tag data indefinitely, and to share information generated by these action tags with our advertisers, affiliates and service providers.

Behavioral Tracking
-------------------

Company uses cookies and other tracking technology on the Site for purposes of tracking Users’ activities after they leave the Site. Company uses this tracking technology to target applicable Users with advertisements regarding the Site Offerings and other products and/or services that Company thinks may be of interest to applicable Users. In addition, third parties, such as Google®, may engage in a similar form of behavioral tracking of Users that visit the Site.

If you wish to opt-out of having this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by emailing [care@nationalinjurybureau.com](mailto:care@nationalinjurybureau.com). Users may also be able to disable some, but not all, of this tracking activity by utilizing the “Do Not Track” setting or similar options within most major Internet browsers. Further, Users may be able to opt-out of this form of tracking utilizing the options made available by the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Please note that opting out of this tracking activity does not opt you out of being served advertising. Even where you opt out of this tracking activity, you will continue to receive generic ads.

To the greatest extent permissible under applicable law, we are not responsible for the tracking practices of third parties in connection with the Site.

Other Websites
--------------

The Site Offerings may contain links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites including, but not limited to, Social Media Websites and the websites of our Third-Party Legal Professionals. Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. In some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of their third-party websites. In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and Company has no responsibility or liability relating to them.

Third-Party Offers
------------------

Company provides Users with the opportunity to receive special offers, products and/or services from third parties including, but not limited to, the Third-Party Legal Professionals. Where you indicate the desire to receive certain offers, products or services from a third party during the applicable information collection process, your personally identifiable information that was provided during that Company information collection process will be shared with the applicable third party so that such third party may provide its product or service to you and so that you do not have to complete another information collection form (or re-supply the same information) to purchase or receive that product or service.

Security of Your Personal Information
-------------------------------------

The privacy of your personal information is very important to us. As such, we endeavor to safeguard and protect our Users’ personal information. When Users make personal information available to us, their personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any personal information offline). Where our registration/application process prompts Users to enter sensitive information (such as medical information, driver’s license/ID card number, health insurance information, data collected from an automated license plate recognition system, Social Security Number and credit card information), and when we store and transmit such sensitive information, that information is encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).

Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is not accessible to the public. The servers that we store personal information on are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your personal information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software constitutes a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your personal information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data by or through the Site Offerings is at your own risk.

All of our Users’ personal information is restricted in our offices. Only employees or third party agents who need personal information to perform a specific job function are granted access to personal information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all User personal information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.

Children’s Privacy
------------------

Please see our [Privacy Provisions for California Residents](https://rounduprisk.com/ccpa/) below for more details regarding the personal information of minors.

No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Site by visitors under eighteen (18) years of age (or the applicable age of majority, if greater than eighteen (18) years of age in their respective jurisdictions). Persons eighteen (18) years of age (or the applicable age of majority, if greater than eighteen (18) years of age in their respective jurisdictions) are not permitted to access the Site Offerings and we do not knowingly collect personal information from such individuals. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.

You may do so by contacting us via e-mail at: [care@nationalinjurybureau.com](mailto:care@nationalinjurybureau.com); provided, however, that we ask individuals to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, amended or removed before processing such requests, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

Please be further advised that, after you delete your personal information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

Opt-Out; Unsubscribe
--------------------

Please see our [Privacy Provisions for California Residents](https://rounduprisk.com/ccpa/) below for instructions on how California Residents can opt-out of the sale of their personal information to third parties.

We provide Users with the ability to opt-out from receiving information sent via electronic mailings on or own behalf and that of our third party advertisers. Users may unsubscribe from receiving e-mail at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every e-mailing. Unsubscribe requests can only be processed by us if you have registered with us in the first instance.

To opt-out from email marketing, please email us at: [care@nationalinjurybureau.com](mailto:care@nationalinjurybureau.com)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may continue to contact you for purposes of communicating information relating to your request for Site Offerings, as well as to respond to any inquiry or request made by you. To opt-out of receiving Site Offerings-related and/or inquiry response-related messages from us, you must cease requesting Site Offerings and cease submitting inquiries to us, as applicable.

If you are visiting the Site from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting the Site and/or otherwise communicating electronically with us, you consent to such transfers. Even if your jurisdiction does not have the same privacy laws as the jurisdiction where our servers are located, we will treat your information as subject to the protections described in this Privacy Policy.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add and/or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. If the manner in which we use personally identifiable information changes, we will notify Users by: (a) sending the modified policy to our Users via e-mail; and/or (b) by any other reasonable means acceptable under applicable state and federal law. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner, and we will only use your information in this different manner where you opt-in to such use.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:

6. 6.Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, but only if you previously provided informed consent.
    
7. 7.Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with CA User expectations based on your relationship with us.
    
8. 8.Comply with a legal obligation.

Exercising Access, Data Portability and Deletion Rights
-------------------------------------------------------

To exercise your access, data portability and/or deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable CA User request to us by either:

* [Clicking here;](https://rounduprisk.com/ccpa/request/)
    
* Emailing us at: [care@nationalinjurybureau.com](mailto:care@nationalinjurybureau.com); or
    
* Sending us U.S. Mail to: 300 Carlsbad Village Dr. 108A-516, Carlsbad, CA 92008.
    

Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable CA User request related to your personal information.

You may only make a verifiable CA User request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable CA User request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are: (1) the person about whom we collected personal information; or (2) an authorized representative.
    
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
    

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable CA User request does not require that you create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable CA User request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format
--------------------------

We endeavor to respond to all verifiable CA User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt thereof. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures that we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable request. The response that we provide will also explain the reasons that we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CA User request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Non-Discrimination
------------------

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services;
    
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
    
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; and/or
