**1\. Scope; Modification of Agreement.**  The Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between Users and Company with respect to Users’ use of the Site Offerings, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and/or understandings with respect to same.  Company may amend the Agreement from time to time in its sole discretion, without specific notice to Users; provided, however, that any amendment or modification to the arbitration provisions, prohibition on class action provisions or any other provisions applicable to dispute resolution (collectively, “Dispute Resolution Provisions”) shall not apply to any disputes incurred prior to the applicable amendment or modification.  The latest Agreement will be posted on the Site, and Users should review the Agreement prior to using any Site Offerings.  By a User’s continued use of the Site Offerings, that User hereby agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions contained within the Agreement effective at that time (other than with respect to disputes arising prior to the amendment or modification of the Dispute Resolution Provisions, which shall be governed by the Dispute Resolution Provisions then in effect at the time of the subject dispute).    

**2\. Requirements; Termination of Access to the Site Offerings.**  The Site Offerings are available only to individuals who: (a) are eighteen (18) years of age (or the applicable age of majority, if greater than eighteen (18) years of age in their respective jurisdictions of residence) or older; and (b) can enter into legally binding contracts under applicable law.  If a User is under eighteen (18) years of age (or the applicable age of majority, if greater than eighteen (18) years of age in her/his jurisdiction of residence) and/or if that User is unable to enter into legally binding contracts under applicable law, that User does not have permission to use and/or access the Site Offerings.  

Company may terminate a User’s access to the Site Offerings at any time and for any reason, in its sole discretion.  Such reasons may include, without limitation, where Company believes that such User is: (i) in any way in breach of the Agreement; and/or (ii) engaged in any improper conduct in connection with the Site Offerings.  

You shall be responsible, at all times, for ensuring that you have an Internet connection, computer/mobile device, up-to-date Internet browser versions, a functioning e-mail account, applicable software, applicable hardware and/or other equipment necessary to access the Site Offerings.  Company does not guarantee the quality, speed or availability of the Internet connection associated with your mobile device and/or computer.  Company does not guarantee that the Site Offerings can be accessed: (A) on all mobile devices; (B) through all wireless service plans; (C) in connection with all Internet browsers; or (D) in all geographical areas.  Standard messaging, data and wireless access fees may apply to your use of the Site Offerings through your wireless device.  You are fully responsible for all such charges and Company has no liability or responsibility to you, whatsoever, for any such charges billed by your wireless carrier.

**3\. Contact Services; Third-Party Legal Professionals.**  Where a User attempts to utilize the Contact Services, that User may be required to submit, and Company may collect, some or all of the following information: (a) the User’s full name; (b) the User’s e-mail address; (c) the User’s telephone number; (d) the User’s zip code; (e) the User’s date of birth; (f) whether the User has already obtained legal representation; (g) questions pertaining to the type of Legal Matter that the User is inquiring about (e.g. type of medical condition suffered, product usage duration, etc.); and (h) any other information requested on the applicable form (collectively, the “User Data”).

Upon entering User Data and clicking on the applicable submission button on the Site, Company may pass the User Data along to one (1) or more of its Third-Party Legal Professionals.  Each User agrees to provide true, accurate, current and complete User Data.  Company’s use of User Data shall be governed by the Privacy Policy.  For a copy of the Privacy Policy, please [Click Here](https://rounduprisk.com/privacy-policy).

Company does not itself provide legal-related products and/or services in connection with any Legal Matter, and the ultimate terms and conditions of any legal-related products and/or services made available via the Contact Services, or otherwise by and through the Site Offerings, shall be determined by the applicable Third-Party Legal Professional.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY FOR ANY PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY ANY THIRD-PARTY LEGAL PROFESSIONAL.

 4\. Law-Related Disclosures; Non-Endorsement; Passive Conduit.  

(a)        Company is not a law firm or a lawyer referral service.  As such, Company offers no legal advice, recommendations, mediation or counseling in connection with any legal matter, under any circumstances, and nothing we do, and no element of the Site Offerings, should be construed as such.  Please use caution and common sense when using the Site Offerings.  Company in no way endorses the content or legality of any responses, statements or promises made by Third-Party Legal Professionals or any other parties featured on the Site or otherwise through the Site Offerings. You should always check with your attorney, accountant and/or other advisors to be sure that any advice, products and/or services offered by and/or through the Site Offerings are appropriate for you.

(b)        Some of the Third-Party Legal Professionals who are accessible by and through the Contact Services pay a fee for inclusion in the Contact Services; provided, however, that Company does not receive any portion of any Third-Party Legal Professional’s fees.  

(c)        Any use of the Site Offerings by Users is not intended to, and will not create, an attorney-client relationship between any such Users and Company.  Without limiting the foregoing, any information submitted to Company and/or any electronic or other communication sent to Company will not create, or be covered by, an attorney-client relationship between Users and Company.  

(d)        The Site Offerings facilitate communication between Third-Party Legal Professionals and potential users of associated law-related products and/or services.  Company does not guarantee that Users will successfully find legal representation through the Site Offerings. The determination of the need for legal services and the choice of legal representation are extremely important decisions and should not be based solely on advertisements, claims of expertise or cost offered by any Third-Party Legal Professional.  

(e)        Company does not review the standing of any Third-Party Legal Professionals with any regulatory authority or bar association.  Therefore, Company makes no representation regarding the status, standing or ability of any Third-Party Legal Professional.  When considering retaining a Third-Party Legal Professional, Users should ask for free background information from that Third-Party Legal Professional and check that Third-Party Legal Professional’s standing with the applicable state bar association.  Company is not responsible for, and in no way endorses, any description or indication of specialization or limitation of practice by any Third-Party Legal Professionals that are accessible through the Site Offerings.  Please be aware that no agency or board may have certified such Third-Party Legal Professional as a specialist or expert in any indicated field of law practice.  In addition, a Third-Party Legal Professional claiming specialization is not necessarily any more expert or competent than other legal professionals.  Users should make an independent investigation of, and confirm and verify all claims made by Third-Party Legal Professionals.  Users are encouraged to use caution when reviewing any information submitted by Third-Party Legal Professionals.  Except where otherwise indicated, the Third-Party Legal Professionals are not certified by the Florida State Bar Board of Legal Specialization and Education, the Texas State Board of Legal Specialization ("Not Certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization"), or any other entity or body.

(f)        Laws vary across legal jurisdictions and may be subject to interpretation by different courts.  Laws are also very specific to individual facts and circumstances, and the law-related Content may not fit your particular circumstances.  The law-related Content is provided for informational purposes only, and may not reflect current legal developments or variances in the law of different jurisdictions. The law-related Content does not necessarily reflect the opinions of any Third-Party Legal Professionals, their partners, clients or affiliates.

(g)        Certain law-related Content may include descriptions of successful lawsuits brought by Third-Party Legal Professionals. These descriptions are not meant to create any unjustified expectations that similar results can be obtained for others, because each case is determined on/by its own specific factual and legal circumstances. No Third-Party Legal Professional can guarantee the success of a case, and past successes, even in very similar lawsuits, do not mean that success in a subsequent case is guaranteed or even likely. Results depend upon a variety of factors unique to each case.

(h)        Company does not involve itself in the agreements between Users and Third-Party Legal Professionals or the actual provision of law-related products and/or services in connection with the relationships created thereby.  

Additional State Specific Disclosures:

No representation is made that the quality of the legal services to be performed by the Third-Party Legal Professionals is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers.

Alaska

The Alaska Bar Association does not accredit or endorse certifying organizations.

Colorado

No representation is made that the quality of legal services to be performed is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other Third-Party Legal Professionals. Colorado does not certify Third-Party Legal Professionals as specialists in any field.

Florida

Company operates as a “Lawyer Directory” as defined under Florida Rule 4-7.23.

Hawaii

A Third-Party Legal Professional may communicate the fact that the Third-Party Legal Professional is certified as a specialist in a field of law by a named organization, provided that the communication: (a) is not false or misleading; (b) clearly states the name of the certifying organization; and (c) is accompanied by a statement that “The Supreme Court of Hawaii grants Hawaii certification only to lawyers in good standing who have successfully completed a specialty program accredited by the American Bar Association.”

Illinois

The Supreme Court of Illinois does not recognize certifications of specialties in the practice of law and such a certificate, award or recognition is not a requirement to practice law in Illinois.

Iowa

The determination of the need for legal services and the choice of a Third-Party Legal Professional are extremely important decisions and should not be based solely upon advertisements or self-proclaimed expertise. Memberships and offices in legal fraternities and legal societies, technical and professional licenses, and memberships in scientific, technical and professional associations and societies of law or field of practice do not mean that a Third-Party Legal Professional is a specialist or expert in a field of law, nor do they mean that such Third-Party Legal Professional is necessarily any more expert or competent than any other Third-Party Legal Professional. A description or indication of limitation of practice does not mean that any agency or board has certified such Third-Party Legal Professional as a specialist or expert in an indicated field of law practice, nor does it mean that such Third-Party Legal Professional is necessarily any more expert or competent than any other Third-Party Legal Professional. All potential clients are urged to make their own independent investigation and evaluation of any Third-Party Legal Professional being considered.

Kentucky

THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT.

Massachusetts

If a Massachusetts Third-Party Legal Professional holds herself, himself or itself out as "certified" in a particular service, field or area of law by a non-governmental body, the certifying organization is a private organization, whose standards for certification are not regulated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Minnesota

Past results afford no guarantee of future results; each matter is different and must be judge on its own merits.

Mississippi

Free background information is available upon request for any Mississippi Third-Party Legal Professional. The listing of any area of practice by a Mississippi Third-Party Legal Professional does not indicate any certification of expertise therein.

Missouri

Neither the Supreme Court of Missouri, nor the Missouri Bar, reviews or approves certifying organizations or specialist designations. The choice of a Third-Party Legal Professional is an important decision and should not be based solely upon advertisements.

Nebraska

Each matter is different and must be judged on its own merits.

Nevada

Neither the State Bar of Nevada, nor any agency of the State Bar, has certified any Third-Party Legal Professional identified here as a specialist or as an expert.

New Jersey

Any certification as a specialist, or any certification in a field of practice, that does not state that such certification has been granted by the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey or by an organization that has been approved by the American Bar Association, indicates that the certifying organization has not been approved, or has been denied approval, by the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey and the American Bar Association. All attorney listings are a paid attorney advertisement and do not in any way constitute a referral or endorsement by an approved or authorized lawyer-referral service.

New Mexico

Any certification by an organization other than the New Mexico Board of Legal Specialization does not constitute recognition by the New Mexico Board of Legal Specialization, unless the Third-Party Legal Professional is also recognized by the Board as a specialist in that area of law. Past successes cannot be assurance of future success because each matter must be decided on its own merits.

New York

Prior results obtained by Third-Party Legal Professionals do not guarantee a similar outcome. Being included on the list of participating Third-Party Legal Professionals requires only a payment, and the selection of a participating Third-Party Legal Professional from that list is the result of a neutral process that involves no evaluative judgment. When a Third-Party Legal Professional is included from that list, it does not mean that Third-Party Legal Professional is the “best” or “right” Third-Party Legal Professional for your needs or that the Third-Party Legal Professional is otherwise preferred over other Third-Party Legal Professionals. Third-Party Legal Professionals or law firms willing to contact you with your permission as a part of our Contact Services pay an additional fee that is separate from the fee they pay for inclusion in our searchable directory of Third-Party Legal Professionals and law firms. Lawyers or law firms that do not pay this additional fee are not included in this service.

Unless otherwise indicated, Texas Third-Party Legal Professionals are Not Certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization in the areas of practice listed on their Listings.

There is no procedure in the State of Vermont for approving certifying organizations.

Virginia

Washington

The Supreme Court of Washington does not recognize certification of specialties in the practice of law.

**18\.  Dispute Resolution Provisions.**  The Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in New York, New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles). **You hereby agree to arbitrate all claims that may arise under the Agreement that you may have against Company or any of the Covered Parties, who are express third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision.  Without limiting the foregoing, should a dispute arise between you and Company and/or any Covered Party including, without limitation, any matter concerning the Site Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) you agree to submit the dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York, in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”); and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found [Here](https://rounduprisk.com/assets/default-pages/initial-dispute-notice.pdf). We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice (“Final Settlement Offer"). If we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute and you wish to proceed, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the AAA, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available [Here](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf). For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions. If the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys’ fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.**

To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit and/or class arbitration as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against any Covered Entity and/or Company (including its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns). You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a class action lawsuit and/or class arbitration, as applicable, or to remove you as a participant in the suit and/or class arbitration, as applicable. You agree to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that Company and/or any Covered Party incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits and/or class arbitrations: (i) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually, and not as a class action or class arbitration, in binding arbitration as provided above; and (ii) is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.

**19\.  Miscellaneous.**  To the extent that anything in or associated with the Site Offerings is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence.  Company’s failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision.  The parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement.  Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.  Company may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without notice to you. The Agreement may not, however, be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under it.  Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.
