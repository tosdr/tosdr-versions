European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses:

We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers.

###### About CWBChicago

![](https://cwbchicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CWBC-LOGO-2021-300x65.jpg)

CWBChicago was created in 2013 by five Chicagoans who had grown disheartened with inaccurate information that was being provided at local Community Policing (CAPS) meetings.

Our coverage area has expanded to cover other North Side neighborhoods. But our mission remains unchanged: To provide original public safety reporting with better context and greater detail than mainstream media outlets.
