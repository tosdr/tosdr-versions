2\. Sift Services
-----------------

2.1 _Provision of Sift Services_. Sift will make those Sift Services elected by you and agreed to by Sift, on a mutually executed Order Form, available to you in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including any applicable Exhibits.

2.2 _Deployment of Sift Software_. Sift will provide Customer, as applicable, the application programming interfaces (the **“APIs”**), JavaScript snippets, SDKs and other technologies (the **“Snippets”**) (collectively, the **“Software”**) to enable Customer to integrate with the Sift Services, including in connection with Customer Properties. Customer will implement the Software (and any updates) in accordance with the Documentation and Sift’s reasonable instructions and acknowledges that failure to do so may cause the Sift Services to cease working properly. Through the API and Sift Services console, Customer (or Customer’s Clients) will submit API Data, and Sift will collect Website Data via the Snippets, as applicable and as authorized by Customer. Customer will promptly remove all Snippets from Customer Properties upon termination of this Agreement and acknowledges that the Snippets will continue to collect Website Data until so removed.

2.3 _Third Party Services_. In some circumstances, Customer may (i) integrate with the Sift Services through an approved third-party application or marketplace via an extension or connector (**“Marketplace”**), (ii) authorize Sift to connect the Sift Services to Customer Providers to receive or send Customer Data or Analytical Results, or (iii) elect to use certain Sift Services product features that incorporate the services or products of a third party (“**Sift Provider**”, and with Marketplace and Customer Provider, “**Third Party Service Providers**”). Customer acknowledges and agrees that (a) the services of such Marketplaces and Customer Providers do not form part of the Sift Services and (b) the Marketplaces and Customer Providers are service providers of Customer and not Sift. Customer’s use of the Marketplace or Customer Providers in connection with the Sift Services may be subject to a separate written agreement between Customer and Sift. In addition, if Customer wishes to use Sift Services product features that incorporate the services of a Sift Provider, to the extent the Sift Provider requires Customer to agree to their terms of service, Customer agrees to do so. If the pricing of any Sift Provider changes, Sift may adjust its pricing to reflect that changed pricing for the Sift Provider. SIFT DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

2.4 _Non-compliance_. Subject to obligations of confidentiality, where a party has a concern that the other party has not complied with this Agreement, the parties agree to exchange information to ascertain the cause of such non-compliance and take reasonable steps to remediate such non-compliance.

2.5 _Customer’s Clients_. Customer may only use the Sift Services for the benefit of its clients (each, a “**Client**“), with prior written approval from Sift in each instance. In the event such written approval is provided, Customer agrees to, prior to any such use of the Sift Services, enter into and maintain a written agreement with each Client that binds each Client with respect to all the terms set forth in the Client Pass-Through Addendum included at the end of this Agreement as [Exhibit A](https://sift.com/legal-and-compliance/exhibit-a/) (the “**Pass-Through Terms**“). Customer further represents, warrants, and covenants that each such agreement will contain data protection addendums that comply with applicable data protection laws, and will appoint Customer as a service provider on behalf of the Client. Customer acknowledges and agrees that, as between the parties, it is solely responsible for and will be liable: (i) for the actions or omissions of any Client in connection with the Sift Services and (ii) for ensuring compliance with this Agreement by such Clients. Any breach or violation of this Agreement by a Client will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Customer. To the extent Customer is using the Sift Services for the benefit of its Clients, “Customer Data” includes any data Customer submits, uploads, or otherwise sends to Sift on behalf of its Clients, and “Customer Properties” includes any Client services and digital applications or properties (e.g., webpages, apps, endpoints) from which Customer Data is collected and submitted, uploaded, or otherwise sent to Sift.

2.6 _Affiliate Ordering and Usage Rights__._ Customer and each of Customer’s respective Affiliates may place orders for Sift Services under this Agreement by executing Order Form(s).  When an Affiliate of Customer signs an Order Form under this Agreement, the Affiliate shall be considered Customer, as applicable, for purposes of such Order Form and shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Customer may utilize its subscriptions to the Sift Services or its purchase of Professional Services for the benefit of itself and its Affiliates; _provided,_ that: (i) any restrictions or obligations set forth in an Order Form apply to Customer on behalf of itself and its Affiliates; and (ii) Customer shall be liable to Sift for all actions and omissions of its Affiliates with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement as if they were those of Customer hereunder.

3\. Proprietary Rights
----------------------

3.1 _Ownership of and Limited License to Customer Data_. As between Sift and Customer, Customer owns and retains all right, title, and interest in and to its Customer Data. Customer grants to Sift a limited, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide right and license to access, collect, use, process, store, copy, and create derivative works from the Customer Data only as set forth in this Agreement.

3.2 _Use of Customer Data_. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Sift may use the Customer Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the limited purpose of providing, maintaining, and improving the Sift Services, which includes improving its machine learning algorithms and data models as necessary to support such uses (the **“Permitted Purpose”**). Customer further acknowledges and agrees that, in connection with the Permitted Purpose, the Customer Data will be commingled with data received from other customers of the Sift Services; provided, that (a) the Customer Data shall not itself be made available to any other customer, and (b) Customer will not be identified to the extent the Customer Data contributes to the analytical results provided to other customers of the Sift Services.

3.3 _Ownership of and Limited License to Sift Services and Analytical Results_. Sift owns and retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Sift Services, including the Software, Documentation, Analytical Results, and Aggregated Data (as defined below). Sift grants to Customer a limited, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide right and license to access and use the Sift Services, including the Software, Documentation and Analytical Results, only as set forth in this Agreement.

3.4 _Feedback and Labels_. If Customer (including any Authorized User) provides Sift any feedback (often referred to as “labels”) in connection with the Sift Services about whether a transaction or event on a Customer Property is associated with fraud, abuse or other illegal activity, Customer shall use reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of such feedback and grants Sift an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use any such feedback or labels for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to Customer or any Authorized User. Sift may label transactions or events on behalf of Customer in order to improve the accuracy of the Sift Services for Customer.

3.5 _Aggregated Data_. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Sift has the right with a perpetual royalty-free, irrevocable license to use data derived from Customer Data in connection with Customer’s use of the Sift Services that is aggregated with comparable data received from other customers (**“Aggregated Data”**) for (a) Sift’s internal purposes such as operating, maintaining, and improving the Sift Services, and (b) distribution of general benchmarking or industry-related reports as part of the Sift Services. For absolute clarity, such Aggregated Data shall not be reasonably capable of identifying any underlying individual nor identify the Customer as a source of any Aggregated Data, nor shall any output of Sift’s use of Aggregated Data include any Customer’s Confidential Information (as subsequently defined) or personal data (as defined under Applicable Laws). Sift will make no attempt to reidentify the Aggregated Data.

3.6 _Beta Services_. From time to time, Sift may invite Customer to try features or pre-release versions of the Sift Services that are not generally available to customers for non-production use (“**Beta Services**”). Customer may accept or decline such invitation in its sole discretion. Beta Services will be clearly designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation or by a description of similar import. Customer’s use of Beta Services will be for the term specified by Sift and if no term is specified, then for the earlier of one year from the start date of the Beta Services or when that version of the Beta Services becomes generally available, and therefore part of the Sift Services. Sift may discontinue Beta Services at any time in Sift’s sole discretion and may never make them generally available. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, THE BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. SIFT HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BETA SERVICE.

4\. Sift Commitments
--------------------

4.1 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Sift will comply with all Applicable Laws in connection with its provision of the Sift Services.

4.2 _Security and Data Protection_. Sift will maintain a security program with administrative, technical, organizational and physical security measures designed to protect Customer Data against unauthorized access, disclosure and loss. If the parties enter into any separate agreement or addendum concerning data protection (“**DPA**”), then such terms will be subject to this Agreement. To the extent the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 applies to Sift’s processing of End User personal data within the Sift Service, Sift and Customer are each data controllers of any personal data that Sift processes in connection with the Sift Services, and to the extent U.S. State Privacy Laws applies to Sift’s processing of End User personal data within the Sift Services, Sift is a “service provider” or “processor” as defined under the applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws.

4.3 _Sift Privacy Policy_. Sift will maintain a readily-accessible service privacy policy on its website (located at [https://sift.com/legal-and-compliance/service-privacy-notice](https://sift.com/legal-and-compliance/service-privacy-notice/)), which it may update from time to time, that provides accurate disclosures concerning its data practices, including the collection, use, processing and sharing of Customer Data for fraud detection and prevention and other compatible purposes.

4.4 _Deletion of Data_. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer may request deletion of the Customer Data. Subject to the provision of Section 3.2 (Use of Customer Data), Sift will perform such deletion within ninety (90) days.

5\. Customer Commitments
------------------------

5.1 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Customer will comply with all Applicable Laws in connection with the use of the Sift Services.

5.2 _Account Registration_. In order to access the Sift Services console, Customer shall register for a Sift account. Account information must be accurate, current and complete, and will be treated by Sift in accordance with its privacy policy (located at [https://sift.com/legal-and-compliance/service-privacy-notice](https://sift.com/legal-and-compliance/service-privacy-notice/)). Customer agrees that Sift may send non-legal notices, statements and other information by email or through Customer’s account. Customer will be solely responsible for all use of the Sift Services under its account, including the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users and any decisions made based on the provision of the Sift Services to Customer. In addition, Customer will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to the Sift Services and will notify Sift immediately of such unauthorized access.

5.3 _Customer Responsibilities_. Customer will use the Sift Services (which, for clarity, include the Analytical Results) only: (a) for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraud, security threats or other illegal or malicious behavior, risk management, and/or managing and responding to chargebacks (as applicable); (b) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Documentation and Sift’s Acceptable Use Policy (located at [https://sift.com/legal-and-compliance/aup](https://sift.com/legal-and-compliance/aup)), which Sift may update reasonably from time to time; and (c) in compliance with all Applicable Laws; and any contractual or other obligation Customer has to any third party. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that its (or its Clients, if applicable) use of the Sift Services, including its provision of the Customer Data and use of Analytical Results, does not violate any Applicable Laws. Customer is solely responsible for any actions or decisions it makes in connection with its use of the Sift Services and Sift does not assume any responsibility or liability for such actions or decisions. If Customer’s Affiliates use Sift Services, Customer warrants that it has the authority to bind those Affiliates to this Agreement and shall be fully liable for Customer’s Affiliates if such Affiliates do not comply with the terms and obligations set forth in this Agreement and any Order Form.

5.4 _Usage Restrictions_. Customer shall not: (a) make the Sift Services available to anyone other than Authorized Users (or Clients, if applicable); (b) transfer, sublicense, resell, time share or similarly exploit the Sift Services (except, if applicable, to the extent necessary for Clients to receive the benefit of the Sift Services); (c) access the Sift Services to build (or facilitate the building of) a competitive product or service; (d) reverse engineer, modify, adapt, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Sift Services, or introduce any malicious code into the Sift Services; (e) provide to Sift any Customer Data that contains any Sensitive Personal information, or (f) use the Sift Services for purposes not contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to purposes prohibited under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) (as described further below) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), or as a factor in establishing an individual’s creditworthiness or eligibility for credit, insurance, housing, or employment, in any way that facilitates discrimination or in any other way that may violate or cause Sift to violate any Applicable Law. For clarity, the foregoing limitations apply to the Analytical Results and any other information derived from use of the Sift Services, as well as the Sift Service itself.

5.5 _IMPORTANT FCRA RESTRICTIONS_. Sift is not a consumer-reporting agency (“Consumer Reporting Agency”) as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (“FCRA”) and the Analytical Results do not constitute “Consumer Reports”, as that term is defined in the FCRA. Customer will not use the Sift Services (including the Analytical Results) for any purposes enumerated in the FCRA in lieu of obtaining a Consumer Report.

6\. Payment
-----------

6.1 Direct Purchases. 

6.1.1 _Fees and Payment Terms__._ For direct purchases made by Customer (where Customer enters into an Order Form directly with Sift), Customer will pay the fees stated on an applicable Order Form (the **“Fees”**) within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice. If Customer believes that Sift has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact Sift no later than sixty (60) days after the invoice date in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an applicable adjustment or credit. Unless otherwise stated on an applicable Order Form, all Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, and all Fees are quoted and payable in the currency stated on the Order Form. Monthly or annual minimum fees paid may not be rolled into any future time period. Sift may charge interest on any unpaid amount due at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date it is paid. In the event Sift pursues collection of any overdue Fees payable hereunder, Customer will reimburse all reasonable third-party costs and fees incurred by Sift in connection with those collection activities. Customer shall be responsible for any payments owed but not paid by any of Customer’s Affiliates ordering Sift Services in any Order Form.

6.1.2 _Taxes_. Unless otherwise stated on the Order Form, the Fees will be exclusive of any local, state, federal, VAT, sales, use, excise or other taxes, levies, or duties. Customer is responsible for paying or reimbursing Sift for any taxes associated with the purchase, unless Customer provides Sift with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority, and excluding taxes based on Sift’s income payable by Sift without regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If applicable, Sift reserves the right to gross up any Fees, if any required withholding prevents Sift from receiving the full amount set forth in the applicable Order Form.    

6.2. Purchases through a Reseller. If Customer purchases any Sift Services and/or Professional Services through a Reseller, this Agreement will govern Customer’s use of such Services and/or Professional Services, but not the payment obligations. In such case, Customer’s payment obligations for such services will be as agreed directly with the Reseller and not Sift. Customer warrants that it will timely pay to Reseller all amounts related to this Agreement. Customer expressly waives and agrees not to exercise any right it may have to downgrade a subscription or terminate a purchase of the Sift Services or Professional Services for its convenience, or otherwise cancel an order under any applicable Reseller, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. Any disputes related to the payment obligations shall be handled directly between Customer and the Reseller.

7.3 _Mandated Disclosures_. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law to do so; provided, the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior written notice of such compelled access or disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the access or disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to access or disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the access or disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.
