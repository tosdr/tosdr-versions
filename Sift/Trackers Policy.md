Sift Website Cookie Notice
==========================

Introduction
------------

**Last Updated: December 14, 2022**

This Cookie Notice explains how Sift Science, Inc. (**“Sift”**) uses cookies and similar technologies  
(such as pixel tags or web beacons) to recognize you when you visit our website at [www.sift.com](https://sift.com/). It  
explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your choices with respect to them.

Some cookies or similar technologies that we use through the websites will collect personal information about you,  
or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other data. Any personal information that  
we collect will be used in accordance with our [Website Privacy Notice.](https://sift.com/site-privacy)

If you do not consent to the use of cookies on our website you may disable them through the link to our Cookie  
Preference Center below, or by changing your browser settings so that cookies from our website cannot be  
placed on your device (usually found in a ‘settings’ menu in your particular browser).

[Cookie Preference Center](https://sift.com/cookie-preference-center)

What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners like Sift to make their websites work, better understand how site visitors use the website, and provide more targeted content to its site visitors.

Cookies created and set by the website owner (in this case, Sift) are called “first party cookies.” Cookies created and set by parties other than Sift are called “third party cookies.” First party cookies are used to provide essential services, such as re-setting your password and inviting a colleague to use Sift. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided through the website (e.g. like videos) and allow those third parties to serve ads to you across different websites you visit.

What types of cookies does Sift use?
------------------------------------

We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. For instance, using a first party cookie is necessary for you to reset your password. Third party cookies help Sift to create a more favorable marketing experience. For example, we place a third party cookie when you sign up to receive a marketing resource from our resource page. After placing the cookie, you would then be able to download additional Sift content without having to re-enter your information. This is described in more detail below.

We use the following types of cookies when you visit our website.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Essential website cookies:** These cookies are strictly necessary to both provide you with content through our website. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the website to you, you may not be able to refuse them and use the Sift website. However, you can block web beacons or delete them by clearing your browser settings, as described below under the heading “How can I refuse or delete cookies?”

**Connection cookies:** Website visitors may interact with Sift in many ways, including chatting with a member of our support team or filling out a web form. These cookies connect these behaviors into a single view, so that Sift can better supply you with content. To refuse or delete these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading “How can I refuse or delete cookies?”

**Functionality and analytics cookies:** These cookies are used on our website to provide relevant content and monitor the effectiveness of such content, track site errors, or provide Net Promoter Surveys (NPS). These cookies may also help Sift improve the effectiveness of its marketing content. To refuse or delete these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading “How can I refuse or delete cookies?”

**Advertising cookies:** These cookies are used to make advertising messages from Sift more relevant to you. Like many other companies, we (using third-party ad partners, such as [Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en) use cookies and web beacons on our website to provide interest-based advertising to you through our ad partners. These cookies can also be used for targeted or cross contextual behavioral marketing purposes. To refuse or delete these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading “How can I refuse or delete cookies?”

For more detailed information about the specific cookies that we use, and to change your cookie settings, please go to our **[Cookie Preference Center](https://sift.com/cookie-preference-center).**

What about other tracking technologies, like pixels or web beacons?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tags,” “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our website. This allows us, for example, to monitor user traffic patterns on our website, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand how you arrived at our website (e.g. from an online advertisement or search engine), and to measure the success of our marketing programs (e.g. e-mail marketing campaigns). In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies and web beacons to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

| Types of tag | Whose tag is implemented | How to refuse |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Analytics**  <br>This tag assists in evaluating our customer engagement and generation of leads. | * [Mintigo](https://www.mintigo.com/about-us/privacy-policy/)<br>* [Digilant](https://www.digilant.com/privacy-policy/) | To refuse or delete the tag’s ability to collect data, please follow the instructions below under the heading “How can I refuse or delete cookies?” |

How can I refuse or delete cookies?
-----------------------------------

Under certain global privacy laws, individuals have rights over the way that cookies are used. In some countries, such as those in the European Union, individuals have to “opt-in” to the use of cookies other than those that are “strictly necessary”.

In other countries, such as the States of California and Virginia in the United States, individuals have the right to “opt-out” from the use of cookies for targeted or cross-contextual behavioral advertising and the sale or sharing of personal information.

In addition to these rights, Sift offers the ability to refuse or delete cookies. If you wish to refuse the use of cookies you may disable them through our [Cookie Preference Center.](https://sift.com/cookie-preference-center)

In addition to the Cookie Preference Center, most browsers allow you to refuse or delete cookies at any time. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.

You can also manage third party advertising preferences for some of the third parties we work with to serve advertising across the Internet by utilizing the choices available at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and [www.aboutads.info/choices.](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) We do not guarantee that all of the third parties we work with will honor the elections you make using those options, but we strive to work with third parties that do.

Furthermore, now you can exercise your legal privacy rights in one step via Global Privacy Control (GPC), required under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and Europe’s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Further information can be found [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

How often will you update this Cookie Notice?
---------------------------------------------

We may update this Cookie Notice from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Notice regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies. The date at the top of this Cookie Notice indicates when it was last updated.

Where can I get further information?
