Terms of Use
------------

**Updated:** Jan 1st 2020

This Agreement (“Agreement”) between you (“you” or “Advertiser”) and adMarketplace Inc., and its affiliates (collectively, “adMarketplace”) consists of these adMarketplace Terms and Conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”), the adMarketplace Frequently Asked Questions (the “FAQs”), the adMarketplace Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) the terms of any advertising campaign you submit or modify and any other terms and conditions or policies set forth on [www.adMarketplace.com](https://admarketplace.com/) (the “Site”) for access to and use of the adMarketplace service (the “Service”), all of which are incorporated by reference.

If an individual is accessing the Service on behalf of a business entity, whether as an employee, consultant or agent of such business entity, by doing so, such individual represents that they have the legal capacity and authority to bind such business entity to this Agreement. You or Advertiser shall refer both to the individual accessing adMarketplace on behalf of a business entity, if any, and any such business entity itself. By accessing and using adMarketplace, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SITE OR THE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE OR THE SERVICE. BY ACCESSING THE SITE OR THE SERVICE, YOU INDICATE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND ACCEPTED THIS AGREEMENT.

**Permitted Uses; Partner Sites.** Subject to this Agreement, you may use the Site solely for the purpose of submitting your ads for products or services for inclusion in the Service. You agree that your ads submitted through the Service may be placed on (i) any web site owned or operated by adMarketplace (an “adMarketplace Web Site”), (ii) if you opt in to the syndication program described in the FAQs, on any web site owned by a third party (a “Partner”) with which adMarketplace has an agreement to place advertisements on your behalf (“Partner Site”). Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by adMarketplace, adMarketplace reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately and without notice reject, remove, modify, suspend or restrict any ad submitted by you, without your consent, to comply with any policy of adMarketplace or any Partner Site, or as otherwise determined by adMarketplace to protect its interests. The Partners may also have certain rights allowing them to reject, modify or withdraw ads placed under this Agreement. Neither adMarketplace nor any Partner shall have any liability to you as a result of exercising such rights.

Prohibited Uses of the Service. adMarketplace strictly prohibits using the Service or any Partner Sites to:

generate, manipulate or other produce or induce fraudulent impressions of or fraudulent clicks on Advertiser’s ads or third-party ads or web sites, including but not limited to using scripts, spyware, robots or other automated tools and/or computer generated search requests, and/or the fraudulent or deceptive use of other search engine optimization services and/or software;

include content in ads, or use the Service in any way, which violates or infringes upon the intellectual property, personal or proprietary rights of any third party, including but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or confidentiality obligations;

include content in ads which may be threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous or inflammatory or that could otherwise violate any other applicable law;

include content in ads which may be false, misleading or deceptive;

advertise goods or services that are illegal in any jurisdiction where the ad is displayed;

advertise goods or services in any way that violates any policy posted on the Site or any Partner Site;

resell the Service to any third party; or engage in any other illegal or fraudulent business practice under the laws of any jurisdiction where you are located or the ad is displayed or any other conduct that adMarketplace or any Partner determines may otherwise result in legal liability.

You may not include links to any web site as part of your ad unless the content found at such web site is relevant to the keywords approved for your ad. You may not run multiple ads linking to the same or similar web site on the same search results page.

**Prohibited Uses of the Site:** You may not use spiders, robots or other automated data mining techniques to catalog, download, store or otherwise reproduce or distribute information available on the Site without our prior consent. You may not take any action to interfere with the Site or the Service or any other user’s use of the Site or the Service, including, without limitation, via means of overloading, “flooding”, “mailbombing” or “crashing” the Site or the Service. You may not frame portions of the Site within another web site or establish links from any other web site to any page of the Site other than the home page.

**Passwords:** adMarketplace shall authorize IDs and passwords at its discretion. Upon requesting a password, you may be required to provide information regarding you or your organization. The ID and password authorized should be safeguarded at all times and not shared with any other party. Upon a change of the responsible personnel in possession of an ID and password, it is your responsibility to immediately contact adMarketplace to update or change passwords or information in your profile. adMarketplace may, from time to time, monitor the logon times and usage under each ID for the purpose of verifying that you are the sole holder and user of the ID and to verify compliance with this Agreement. To the extent any party under the reasonable control of you gains access to the Service through use of the ID or by circumventing adMarketplace’s security systems, you shall be liable to adMarketplace for all such use, including payment of any fees and liability for the content, display or use of any ads. adMarketplace retains the right to suspend or revoke IDs at any time for a violation or potential violation of this Agreement.

**Limited License:** adMarketplace hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable license to use the Site on one computer at a time, for your own internal business purposes and solely to participate in the Service with the intention of placing ads. In no event may you modify or create derivative works based on the Site or the Service or any part thereof. All rights not specifically licensed to you hereunder are retained by adMarketplace.

**Proprietary Rights:** The Site, the Service, and everything incorporated or used in connection with the Site or the Service, including but not limited to software, designs, graphics, text, methods, processes, technology and other intellectual property, are owned, or authorized for use, by adMarketplace.

A cancelled ad may continue to run for up to 1 business day before such cancellation takes effect. Upon cancellation of any ad or termination of this Agreement for any reason, you shall remain liable for any amount due for clicks already delivered or for clicks on any ads through the date such cancellation or termination takes effect.

**Payment.** You agree to pay all applicable charges under this Agreement or as set forth on any form on the Site, including any applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity. adMarketplace shall proceed to charge your credit card based upon your stated budget.

You acknowledge that adMarketplace has entered into this Agreement relying on the limitations of liability stated herein and that adMarketplace would not offer you the Service without those limitations, which are an essential basis of the bargain.

**Your Obligation to Indemnify.** You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless adMarketplace and Partners, including their respective employees, directors, officers, agents, representatives and affiliates, from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, arising from, or related to, any breach by you of this Agreement or any applicable law or your ads as submitted to the Service.

**Changes:** All information posted on the Service is subject to change without notice. Your continued access of the Service after such changes conclusively demonstrates your acceptance of those changes.

**Severability:** If any part of this Agreement shall be held or declared to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective but shall not affect any other part of this Agreement and the invalid portion of any provision shall be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy such invalidity while retaining the original intent of the parties.

**Waiver; Remedies:** The failure of adMarketplace to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of adMarketplace of any breach of this Agreement by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by adMarketplace or be deemed a waiver by adMarketplace of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of this Agreement. The rights and remedies of adMarketplace under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any right or remedy shall not limit a right to exercise any other right or remedy hereunder.
