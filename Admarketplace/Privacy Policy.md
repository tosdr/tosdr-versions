Privacy Policy
--------------

**Updated:** September 05, 2023

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) informs about Personal Information processed  
through adMarketplace, Inc.’s ("adMarketplace’s") products and services (“Service(s)”)  
which is for the purpose of providing certain advertising related services for our  
Customers.

This Privacy Policy also informs about information collected from this website,  
[www.admarketplace.com](http://www.admarketplace.com/), which serves two basic functions. First, it has  
information about our Services as well as online advertising generally. Second, it is a portal  
for adMarketplace publishers and advertisers ("Customer(s)") to access certain restricted,  
Customer-only materials through secure log-in.

This Privacy Policy does not relate to Customer business information shared with us (e.g.,  
billing or contact details). As well, it does not relate to information shared by employees or  
other staff, or by applicants for positions with our company. You may reach your business  
or HR contact for inquiries related to such information).

**1\. Our Commitment to Data Privacy**
--------------------------------------

It is of critical importance to us to keep the information we collect secure. adMarketplace is  
also committed to protecting the privacy of consumers and observes compliance with  
applicable laws, including the EU’s and United Kingdom’s Data Protection Regulation  
("GDPR") and various state privacy laws in the United States including CCPA (“US Privacy  
Laws”) and relevant laws of other countries and/or regions, collectively referred to as  
“Data Protection Laws”. As our practices evolve, this Privacy Policy may be revised to  
reflect those changes. Notice of such amendments will be posted as an updated notice on  
this website. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically in order to keep up to date with  
any modifications.

**2\. Who is adMarketplace?**
-----------------------------

adMarketplace is a provider of Services that enable our Customers to reach consumers as  
they search for or indicate intent to learn more about or engage with our Customers’  
products or services. Our Services do not use **Personal Information** to track, target, or  
otherwise profile consumers across unrelated websites, apps, devices, platforms or  
properties (collectively referred to herein as ‘**Sites**’). Personal Information (also referred to  
as Personal Data) means any information related to an identifiable person and includes IP  
addresses, cookie identifiers and device identifiers.

(Personal Information is distinct from **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** which is  
information that on its own is able to identify, contact, or locate an individual. An example  
of PII is an individual’s email address. adMarketplace Services do not collect, process, or  
use PII).

The corporate entity that decides how and for what purpose we process information (the  
legal basis for processing) is:

    Customers, below the search box

    allow you to directly navigate to the brand Site(s) and "skip" having to go to  
    a search engine results page
* Post-search: we may include links to brand Sites within search results
* Native Search: we may include links to brand Sites within editorial, informational  
    or consumer-generated content
* Push Notifications: if you have expressly opted-in, we may show notifications  
    from brands at a specific time of day to your desktop, mobile or other device
* Auto-complete Search: we may provide auto-complete feature and/or redirect  
    your mistyped or misspelled brand searches to the actual brand domain you may

behalf to deliver Services. Our bases for processing when you visit Customer Sites is  
as follows:

    visited their Site, to display advertising
* When a consumer clicks on an ad (creative) displayed on the site of our  
    publisher customer, we may operate as processor or service provider to the  
    advertiser whose ad (creative) the consumer chose to click

    Customers
* In order to maintain security, identify fraud and similar misconduct
* In order to understand trends in how users react to particular types of  
    advertisements or offers
* In order to provide insights and reporting back to Customers, such as statistical  
    reporting in connection with the activity on Sites, optimization of the location of  
    ad placement, ad performance, reach and frequency metrics, and billing
* In order to resolve or fix technical issues or problems and to respond to user  
    inquiries and requests
* In order to comply with legal obligation - in some cases, we may have a legal  
    obligation to collect, maintain, or disclose personal information about you in  
    relation to the Services

Information is as follows:

* To process the information voluntarily shared with us when you contact us

    of data sent from a website and stored in a user’s web browser or pixels (graphics  
    embedded in ad content to reflect an interaction with an ad on a Customer’s website  
    – pixels work similarly to cookies). You can find more information about different

The Services are not intended to process personal information of children under the age of  
16 and we do not knowingly collect, sell, share, or process any personal information from  
children under the age of 16. If you, as a parent or guardian, believe that your child under  
the age of 16 has interacted with our Services and caused us to unknowingly collect  
their personal information, please contact us and we will use our best efforts to identify  
and remove their information to the extent it is in our records.

In addition to our personal information collection and processing, we may collect, create,  
process, disclose and store information that is not considered personal information  
because it is not identifiable to a particular individual, such as sets of aggregate data,  
metadata, and other generalized information about online browsing, usage and  
interactions, as well as de-identified information that does not reveal your identity. We do  
not attempt to re-identify or associate such information to you, and we retain the right to  
use and disclose such information in any manner permitted by applicable law.

**7\. What are the Sources of Personal Information?**
-----------------------------------------------------

1. **Information received through** **technologies:** When you interact with or on our  
    Customer’s Sites, depending on the applicable laws in your location, we may receive  
    the categories of information provided above, through technologies such as APIs or  
    cookies
2. **Information we receive from our Customers or their data providers:** Our  
    Customers may supply us with personal information about consumers, to the extent  
    they have confirmed that they have sufficient authority to provide this information  
    to us, in order to deliver more relevant content, advertising, products or services.  
    Such processing is subject to those Customers’ privacy policies and the legal terms  
    under which they collected the relevant personal information

**8\. Personal information disclosures**

When we disclose personal information, we disclose it to the following categories of  
recipients for the following business and commercial purposes:

1. to our Customers or their designated third-party representatives as part of our Services
2. to technology, infrastructure, operations and other service providers to help support  
    the infrastructure necessary to provide the Services

    activity

    entity

advertising or otherwise as those terms are defined under applicable U.S. Privacy Laws.

**9\. Security**
----------------

adMarketplace applies commercially reasonable physical, technical and organizational  
security measures to protect information from unauthorized access, corruption or loss.  
These include storing information in databases which are protected by security measures  
such as password protection, multi-factor authentication, and encryption using Transport  
Layer Security technology (TLS). However, no system can be completely secure, and we  
make no guarantees as to security of information transmitted through our Services or our  
own website ([adMarketplace.com](http://admarketplace.com/))

**10\. Third Parties we work with**
-----------------------------------

We may use processors or service providers for our business purposes (e.g. for data storage  
or fraud detection); when we do so, we obligate these services to comply with our Privacy  
and Security policy requirements and the Privacy Shield Principles for onward data  
transfers, including obligations to provide the same level of protection that we afford for  
transferred data.

The adMarketplace website may contain links to third party websites; please be aware that  
we do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites. If  
you follow a link to those websites, you should read their privacy notice and terms and  
conditions to discern their practices.

**11\. International Data Transfers**
-------------------------------------

For EU and UK data transfers to entities in countries that have not been deemed to provide  
an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, we use approved contracts,  
such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to Third  
Countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with Commission  
Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 and the United Kingdom’s  
International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual  
Clauses, in force 21 March 2022, as appropriate and additional safeguards where required.

adMarketplace complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the  
UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework  
(Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  adMarketplace has  
certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy  
Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal  
data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the  
United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  
adMarketplace has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the  
Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard  
to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles  
and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the  
Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit

not been able to satisfactorily resolve the issue, then, you may submit your complaint to  
JAMS using this link: [https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework).  
JAMS is adMarketplace’s designated DPF dispute resolution provider.

For transfers of personal data from non-EU/UK countries where international data transfers are  
limited or restricted, we comply with the relevant applicable laws to legitimize such transfers.

adMarketplace is responsible for processing personal information it receives under the DPF  
and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. adMarketplace  
shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a  
manner inconsistent with the Principles unless it shows it is not responsible for the event  
giving rise to the matter.
