### 3\. How we use information we collect

How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.

To provide the Services and personalize your experience:

We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services.

To communicate with you about the Services:

We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.

To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services:

We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of special interest to you, including by email and by displaying Tiny ads on other companies’ websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.

With your consent:

We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.

### 4\. Legal bases for processing (for EU users)

If you are an individual in the European Union (“EU”), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:

1. We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
2. It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;
3. You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
4. We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.

### 5\. How we share information we collect

We share information about you through the Services and with certain third parties. We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers, but we are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.

Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws;

Enforcement of Our Rights: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Tiny, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.

You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

### 6\. How we store and secure information we collect

Information storage and security

We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.

While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Tiny.

How long we keep information

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

Account information:

We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

Information you share on the Services:

If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided.

Marketing information:

If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Tiny account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.

### 7\. Cookies and tracking notice

Like many websites, we also use standard technologies such as “cookies,” which are files placed on your computer’s hard drive by the sites you visit.

#### 8.2 Your rights in California

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Code”) permits users of our Site who are California residents and have provided Personal Data to us to request from us certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

As required by the Code, at your request we will provide you with the categories of Personal Data that we collect through the Site and the categories of third party persons or entities with whom such Personal Data may be shared. California law requires us to inform you, at your request, of (a) the categories of Personal Data we collect and the third parties with whom we share that information; (b) the names and addresses of those third parties; and (c) examples of the products marketed by those third parties. To make such a request, please send an email to legal@tiny.cloud or write us at: Tiny Technologies, Inc. 2100 Geng Rd, Suite 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303-3354, United States of America.

The Code allows you to control the parties with whom we share Personal Data and the specific Personal Data that you do not wish to be shared with those parties. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Personal Data you do not want us to share with third parties. The request should be emailed to the attention of our Legal Department, legal@tiny.cloud and labeled “California Customer Choice Notice.” We will respond as soon as are able. Please note that there is no charge for processing this request.

### 9\. The Security of your information

To help protect the privacy of the Personal Data you transmit through use of the Services, we use commercially reasonable security practices that are technically feasible for us to protect the user data we collect against unauthorized access, including, without limitation, physical, technical, and administrative safeguards. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Data to our employees, agents, and officers who need the information to perform their responsibilities. However, please be aware that the Site and our services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control. We cannot guarantee the security of the information on and sent from our Site, and we are not responsible for the acts and omissions of third parties who receive the information.
