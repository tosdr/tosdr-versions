Please note that, because we and our designees host Forums found on the Site and, therefore, redistribute materials you give to us, we require certain rights in those materials. Accordingly, by sending or transmitting to us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, data, content, or other materials (collectively, “Submissions”), or by posting such Submissions to any area of the Site, you grant us and our designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), assignable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right to use, reproduce, publish, distribute (through multiple tiers), create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale and import such Submissions in any media now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions. You represent and warrant that you have the relevant rights and licenses to upload, post, or transmit the Submissions. None of the Submissions will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise, on our part and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions.

Information on our Forums is provided by our staff and other contributors, some of whom use anonymous screen names and are people not otherwise connected with Company. You acknowledge that a large volume of information is available in our Forums and that people participating in such Forums occasionally post messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, misleading or deceptive. We neither endorse nor are responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed on the Site or Forums by third parties, whether such third parties are visitors to the Site, members of the Company community or others. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants and may not reflect the opinion(s) of Company. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in articles or postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of such information.

We have no obligation to monitor the Site or the Forums, or any Submissions or other Materials that you or other third parties transmit or post on the Site or the Forums. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right (but not the obligation) to monitor the Site and the Forums and the Submissions and Materials you transmit or post; to alter or remove any such Materials (including, without limitation, any posting to a Forum); to disclose such Materials and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to operate the Site properly; to protect ourselves, our sponsors and our members and visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.

### 8\. Making purchases

If you wish to license Software or obtain the services described on the Site, you will be asked by Company or the third party provider of the product or service to supply certain information applicable to your purchase, including, without limitation, credit card and other information. You understand that Company will treat any such information in the manner described in our Privacy Policy , which can be found at https://www.tiny.cloud/legal/privacy/. You agree that all information that you provide to Company or such third party provider will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your purchases.

### 9\. Information Provided by Company

Although Company strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, laws, regulations, data and other information change frequently and are subject to varying interpretations. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although Company endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete. Please contact Company at legal@tiny.cloud to determine whether you have the most recent version of the Materials made generally available by Company.

In addition, portions of the Content have been contributed to the Site by various vendors, suppliers, specialists and service providers. The inclusion of such information does not indicate any approval or endorsement of such providers, and Company expressly disclaims any liability with respect to the foregoing.

### 10\. Links

The Site contains links to other Internet web sites, including affiliated web sites which may or may not be owned or operated by Company. Company has not reviewed all of the web sites that are linked to the Site, and Company has no control over such sites and is not responsible for the content provided on linked sites. You acknowledge and agree that Company is not responsible for or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites, any updates or changes to such sites, or the privacy or other practices of such sites, and the fact that Company offers such links does not indicate any approval or endorsement of any material contained on any linked site. Company is providing these links to you only as a convenience and as a result, you access them at your own risk. Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the terms of use and practices of any linked site, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Company. Further, it is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select or software you download (whether from the Site or other sites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects, date bombs, time bombs and other items of a destructive nature.

### 11\. Ownership and Restrictions on Use

The Site is owned and operated by Company and the Content (and any intellectual property and other rights relating therein and thereto) are and will remain the property of Company and its licensors and suppliers. The Site and Content and the selection, compilation, collection, arrangement and assembly thereof are protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark and other laws, and you acknowledge that these rights are valid and enforceable. You may not copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit or distribute Content or information available on or through the Site in any way without our prior written permission. The Content may be used solely to the extent necessary for your authorized use of the Site, as provided in this Agreement or as expressly authorized in writing by Company or, if so indicated in writing by Company, its licensors or suppliers. Modification of the Content or use of the Content for any other purpose is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights, and is strictly prohibited. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Site or the Content.

The trademarks, trade names, logos, and service marks displayed on the Site (collectively the “Trademarks”) are the registered and unregistered trademarks of Company, Company’s licensors and suppliers, and others. The Trademarks owned by Company, whether registered or unregistered, may not be used for any purpose including, but not limited to use as metatags on other pages or sites on the Internet without the written permission of Company or such third party which may own the Marks or in connection with any product or service that is not Company’s, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion with customers, or in any manner that disparages Company. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark without the express written permission of Company, Company’s licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark. Use of any Trademarks is prohibited, and Company will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights in such Trademarks, including via civil and criminal proceedings.

### 12\. Claims of Copyright Infringement

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Company infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted by Company on one of our Forums), you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Company to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by Company against you, the DMCA permits you to send Company a counter-notice.
