Leanpub Terms of Service
========================

_These Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service” or “Terms”) are effective as of April 21, 2010, and were last updated on October 7, 2024. These Terms of Service may be updated periodically, and we recommend that users check them regularly._

Leanpub is owned and operated by Ruboss Technology Corporation (“Ruboss”), incorporated in British Columbia, Canada. These Terms govern your access to and use of Leanpub, including its website, applications, public APIs, and client software (collectively, the “Site”, “Services” or “Leanpub”). They also apply to any information or materials uploaded, downloaded, or otherwise made available via the Services, such as videos, code samples, Course materials, ebooks (in PDF, EPUB, or other formats), and all other forms of content (collectively referred to as “Content”).

Any person accessing the Services (referred to as “User” or “Users”), including those creating or managing Content, must stay informed of updates to these Terms. Ruboss is not liable for notifying users of changes or for ensuring users have read the latest version.

These Terms outline the rights we hold as the owner and operator of the Services and the rights you hold as a user. While legally formal, we strive to make the Terms clear and understandable.

Agreement Acceptance
====================

BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. RUBOSS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THESE TERMS AT ANY TIME, AND YOUR CONTINUED USE OF LEANPUB OR ACCESS TO CONTENT CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF ANY CHANGES. YOUR USE OF LEANPUB IS CONDITIONAL UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TERMS.

Your Ability to Accept Terms
----------------------------

By accepting these Terms, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement, and that doing so does not conflict with any other arrangements or agreements between you and any other entity or individual.

You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Ruboss and are not barred from receiving services under Canadian law or the laws of other applicable jurisdictions (including minimum age requirements). Your use of the Services must comply with these Terms and all local, provincial, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. If you are unwilling or unable to be bound by these Terms, you are not permitted to use the Services and must stop immediately.

Additionally, by accepting the Terms, you represent and warrant that your use of the Services does not _require_ Ruboss to perform any legal or administrative actions. This includes, but is not limited to, Ruboss being obligated to enter into a separate signed contract, complete or submit any forms (such as vendor information forms, tax-related forms, or similar documents), or provide you or others with any documents (such as a certificate of fiscal residence or similar records). However, Ruboss may, at its sole discretion, choose to engage in such actions on a case-by-case basis.

Minimum Age Requirements
------------------------

1. **Children Under 13**: Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from accessing or using the Site or Services for any reason. If we become aware that a child under 13 has created an account or provided personally identifiable information, we will take steps to delete such information from our records. Parents or guardians who discover that their child under 13 has breached this rule should contact us at **privacy@leanpub.com** to have the account and associated data deleted.
    
2. **Minors Aged 13 to 17**: Minors aged 13 to 17 are permitted to access the Site and Services but are restricted from accessing any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, including mature content such as Erotica. Leanpub implements content filters to prevent access to these areas. It is the responsibility of parents or guardians to monitor the online activities of minors and ensure they do not attempt to bypass these content filters.
    
3. **Responsibility for Minors**: Parents or legal guardians who provide access to Leanpub for Minors are responsible for monitoring the content accessed and ensuring that minors do not misrepresent their age or attempt to access mature or restricted content. Ruboss disclaims all responsibility and liability for Minors who violate these terms or for parents or guardians who fail to adequately monitor their child’s usage of the Site and Services.
    
4. **NSFW Content Restrictions**: Mature content, such as Erotica, is categorized and protected by content filters to prevent access by minors. Minors will not be able to access any area of the Site that contains NSFW content. Any attempt by a minor to bypass these filters is a violation of these Terms and may result in account suspension or termination.
    
5. **Reporting and Action**: If we become aware that a minor is accessing restricted content, we will take appropriate action, which may include notifying the Account Holder (parent or guardian) via email and suspending the account if necessary. Leanpub reserves the right to take further action at its sole discretion if these rules are violated.
    

Use of the Services
===================

Description of Services
-----------------------

Leanpub is a platform for creating and distributing works, including ebooks and courses (the “Product” or “Products”). It supports the “Lean Publishing” process, encouraging creators to publish and sell their work while it is still in development. This approach helps authors build a community of readers early, collect valuable feedback, and incentivize creative pricing strategies (e.g., offering lower prices to early adopters). It also provides encouragement to authors to complete works that might otherwise be abandoned.

Service Availability
--------------------

Ruboss disclaims responsibility for the availability, timeliness, security, or reliability of the Services or any client software. Ruboss reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services at any time without notice or liability. This includes the right to impose limits on the use or storage of files within the Services, at Ruboss’s sole discretion.

Users are responsible for any data charges incurred through their mobile or internet service provider while using the Services (e.g., using the Send to Kindle feature). Ruboss will not be liable for these charges.

The basic use of Leanpub, excluding the purchase of paid Products and Product Creation Purchases, is free for all users. However, any costs related to mobile or internet service provider fees still apply, and Ruboss is not liable for those charges.

Security
--------

We implement appropriate technical, organizational, and procedural measures to help protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, considering the risks involved and the nature of the Personal Information. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you can contact us at dpo@leanpub.com.

Leanpub accounts require a username or email address and a password to log in. Members are responsible for keeping their password secure and must not disclose it to third parties. Account passwords are hashed, meaning we cannot view a User’s password.

General User Details and Responsibilities
-----------------------------------------

### User Registration and Information

You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide during registration on the Site (your “User Information”) is accurate and complete. If any part of your User Information changes, you must promptly update it on the Site. It is your responsibility to keep all User Information current.

As part of registration, you will select a username and password. You are solely responsible for: a) all activity on the Site using your username and password, including monitoring any Minor’s use of your account, and b) maintaining the confidentiality of your password. We recommend using a “strong” password (a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) for your account. Ruboss cannot be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to comply with these security responsibilities. Only one individual may access the Site at a time using the same username and password. You must notify Ruboss immediately of any unauthorized use of your email, username, or password, or any other security breaches you become aware of. Ruboss reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without the need to provide a reason, to refuse usernames or passwords that impersonate others, are protected by trademark or proprietary rights, are offensive, or for any other reason.

User registration and information are subject to Leanpub’s [Privacy Policy](https://leanpub.com/privacy).

### User Profile Policy

You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information in your Leanpub Account, including your name, email address, photo, and other details. You may maintain only one account at a time. If your account is disabled or terminated by Ruboss, you may not create a new account without explicit permission.

You are not permitted to use a profile photo of another person. If you are writing under a pseudonym and do not wish to display your identity, you may upload an image of an inanimate object or a disguised image, but not a photo of someone else.

### User Responsibility

You are responsible for your use of the Services, any Content you post, and any consequences that arise from it. The Content you submit, post, or display may be visible to other Users and through third-party services and websites. Only share Content that you are comfortable with being public under these Terms.

Ruboss accepts no liability for any Content posted to the Service, whether published, in-progress, or otherwise.

Leanpub Accounts
----------------

### Account Types

When you sign up on Leanpub, you create a personalized account by providing a username, password, and potentially other information (an “Account”). Leanpub Accounts serve various purposes, with different features available depending on usage. For clarity, these Terms may reference Accounts according to specific functions:

* **Author Account**: Provides editorial access to at least one Product.
    
* **Cause Account**: For non-profit or charitable organizations accepted into the Leanpub for Causes program.
    
* **Organization Account**: Provides editorial access to at least one Product under the designation of “Organization.”
    
* **User Account**: Allows purchasing and reading Leanpub Products, as well as interacting with Authors, Organizations, and other Users on the Site (e.g., reader discussion forums).
    

### Account States

Each Account can exist in one of the following states (“Account States”):

* Closed
    
* Stealthed
    
* Suspended
    
* Unverified
    
* Verified
    

Access to Account features and information is determined by its Account State.

### Suspending Accounts

**AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, RUBOSS MAY TAKE ACTIONS AGAINST A USER WHO VIOLATES THESE TERMS OR ENGAGES IN UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR, WITHOUT NOTIFYING THE USER. RUBOSS MAY DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, OR OTHER ACTIONS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE VIOLATION:**

* **REMOVE ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS OR MATERIAL FROM THE SERVICES;**
    
* **DISABLE THE USER’S ACCESS TO THEIR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS;**
    
* **REPORT THE USER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES;**
    
* **REFUND ALL REFUNDABLE PURCHASES OF ANY OF THE USER’S PRODUCTS; AND**
    
* **PERMANENTLY BAN THE USER FROM THE SERVICES, INCLUDING EXISTING AND FUTURE ACCOUNTS.**
    

### Terminating Membership and/or Removing Content

Ruboss may, at its sole discretion and without notice, terminate or suspend any Account for any reason. This includes suspicious activities such as credit card fraud, unauthorized transactions, or suspected money laundering.

Upon termination, Ruboss has no obligation to refund any amounts paid to Ruboss, nor to make future payments (e.g., royalties).

### Closing Your Account

You can close your Account by using a feature on the Site or by contacting [hello@leanpub.com](mailto:hello@leanpub.com) with your request. Your request will be processed within 30 days after it is acknowledged by Ruboss. Certain provisions, such as those related to payment, service fees, limitations of liability, and proprietary rights (including license rights like the Permissions Agreement), will survive account closure or termination.

After closing your Account, any Product you sold through Leanpub may still be accessible to Users who previously purchased it. Content that has been removed from sale but was previously purchased (including free purchases) may still appear elsewhere on Leanpub, such as in user libraries.

Ruboss retains no residual rights to remove your work beyond what is outlined here. If we receive a request to close an Author Account, we may refund all refundable purchases of Products where the User is the Primary Author, at our discretion.

#### Requesting a Special Account Closure Addendum

Some Users, such as publishing companies with Organization accounts or Authors planning significant advertising investments, may wish to negotiate special terms regarding Account closure, such as advance notice of termination or an agreed notice period.

To request a special Account closure addendum, please email [hello@leanpub.com](mailto:hello@leanpub.com).

### Abandoned Accounts

If there is no User activity or Product sales for three consecutive years, Ruboss may classify the Account as abandoned (“Abandoned Account”) without notification.

User activity includes actions such as purchasing a Product or adding it to the User’s Account. If an Account is deemed abandoned, Ruboss may restrict or close the Account, and take other actions regarding any royalties owed.

To request reactivation of an Abandoned Account, please email hello@leanpub.com.

#### Inactivity Fee with Abandoned Accounts

If royalties are owed to a User with an Abandoned Account, royalty payments will be suspended, and the owed royalties will be withheld.

Maintaining Accounts, particularly those with unpaid royalties, incurs costs. Therefore, an inactivity fee of $10 per year may be deducted from unpaid royalties on Abandoned Accounts. If less than $10 remains in unpaid royalties, the remaining amount will be deducted to bring the balance to zero, after which no further fees will apply.

### Death of Account Owner

If the owner of an Account dies, ownership of the Account transfers according to applicable legal circumstances. Leanpub will not “lock” or unpublish any associated Products unless formally requested by someone authorized to make such a request.

Leanpub Products
----------------

A Leanpub Product is a digital, User-created work available for sale or free through the Services.

### Product Types

Leanpub supports the creation and purchase of the following Product types:

* Ebooks (“Book” or “Books”)
    
* Ebook bundles (“Bundle” or “Bundles”)
    
* Online courses (“Course” or “Courses”)
    
* Sets of multiple courses (“Track” or “Tracks”)
    
* Packages of ebooks and additional digital content (“Package” or “Packages,” and the uploaded “Extra” or “Extras”)
    

### Product Workflows

Authors can create and publish Products using one of two workflows:

* **Leanpub Workflow**: Content is written in plain text and generated using the Services.
    
* **Upload Workflow**: Authors produce Book files or Extras independently and upload them to Leanpub.
    

#### Changing a Product Workflow

Product Workflows are subject to change. If a workflow is removed, Leanpub may, at its discretion, convert affected Products to a different workflow.

### Product Availability

Leanpub does not guarantee file compatibility with any specific applications, devices, or versions of the Site, Services, or applications.

Availability may depend on the workflow used. For instance, Books created via the Leanpub Workflow are available in PDF, EPUB, and browser-readable formats, while Upload Workflow Books may be limited to specific formats (e.g., just PDF or EPUB).

#### Restrictions on Digital Files Uploaded to Leanpub

Uploaded files must comply with strict rules:

* You must own the copyright or have permission to upload and store the file on Leanpub. No third party may hold rights that prevent you from uploading the file, unless you have formal consent (e.g., a legally binding distribution agreement).
    
* Files must not violate these Terms, contain Digital Rights Management (DRM) software, watermarking, or promote other publishing services through headers, footers, or verso pages.
    
* Files must not contain viruses or malware, and for ebooks categorized as Erotica, no images beyond the cover page are allowed.
    

Leanpub does not automatically inspect uploaded files for compliance but reserves the right to remove any file if it violates these Terms, at its discretion.

#### Leanpub Does Not Use Digital Rights Management (DRM)

Leanpub does not use DRM software or any form of copy-control systems. Authors are not permitted to upload Products that contain DRM protections, including password protection.

#### Leanpub Does Not Accept Watermarked Content

Content, including Books, with watermarks is not allowed on Leanpub.

#### Leanpub Prohibits Headers, Footers, or Verso Pages Promoting Other Publishing Services

Content that contains promotional material for other publishing services in headers, footers, or verso pages is prohibited.

#### Leanpub Prohibits Sample Books Promoting the Full Version on Other Services

Leanpub Users are not permitted to upload sample Books that direct customers to other services to purchase the complete Book.

### Product States

A Leanpub Product is always in a specific state (the “Product State” or “Product States”), which affects how it is presented or accessed on Leanpub. Examples of Product States include “Published” and “Unpublished.”

The meaning of a Product State is defined by Leanpub and may change at any time. New Product States may be added, and old ones removed, at Leanpub’s sole discretion, without notice. Current Product States include Published, Unpublished, Embargoed, Retired, Forcibly Retired, and Deleted.

The Product State affects access and availability and may be changed by Ruboss at any time. For example, if the copyright ownership of a Product is disputed, Ruboss may change the Product State from Published to Unpublished without notice.

#### Product Categories

Leanpub Products can be associated with one or more categories (the “Category” or “Categories”) to help Users discover them.

Ruboss may create, modify, or remove Categories at its discretion. Ruboss may also reassign Categories chosen by a User if they do not align with the perceived purpose or nature of the Product.

#### Product Completion

Leanpub Products can be published and sold while incomplete, especially if they are works in progress.

Publishing or selling an in-progress Product does not guarantee that the Product will be completed by Leanpub or the Author.

### Product Pricing

Authors set the following parameters for each Product:

1. Whether the Product allows free purchases.
    
2. A Minimum Paid Price, which is the lowest amount a User can pay.
    
3. A Suggested Price, which is the default price (including $0) that the User is prompted to pay.
    

Leanpub applies the following Pricing Constraints:

1. All Products (Books, Bundles, Courses, Tracks) currently support free purchases, though this may change in the future.
    
2. The lowest value of a Minimum Paid Price for a Book is $0.99. For Bundles, Courses, or Tracks, the Minimum Paid Price is $7.99.
    
3. Suggested Prices have default values but can be set to any amount starting from the Minimum Paid Price the Author has chosen and up. They can also be set to $0 if the Product allows free purchases.
    
4. The Maximum Price allowable for any Product is $25,000.
    

#### Purchasing Multiple Copies of a Product

Users can purchase multiple copies of a Product in two ways:

1. **Price Increase Method**: The User increases the price to the equivalent of multiple copies (e.g., five times the single copy price). Since Leanpub uses no Digital Rights Management, these copies can be shared directly.
    
2. **Shopping Cart Method**: The User purchases multiple copies using the shopping cart, which generates a purchase token (the “Purchase Token” or “Purchase Tokens”) for each copy. These tokens can be sent via email to recipients (“Purchase Token Recipients”) and redeemed once per recipient.
    

Additionally, Authors can create **Packages** that allow Users to purchase a defined number of copies of a Book at a discounted price. For example, an Author could offer a 100-copy package that costs less than buying 100 individual copies. This option allows Authors to provide bulk discounts for their Products.

#### Coupons

Authors can issue Coupons to offer Products at prices different from the Minimum or Suggested Prices. Coupons can have constraints such as Start Dates, End Dates, and Maximum Uses and are redeemable only for the Product they were created for.

Leanpub may issue Coupons to provide review copies, resolve customer complaints, or promote customer satisfaction, at its discretion.

### Providing Time-of-Purchase Product Content

At our discretion, we may provide Users with the Content as it was at the time of their purchase (“Time-of-Purchase Content”), including free purchases. This is typically done when an Author replaces substantial content with trivial or unrelated material, such as switching a completed Book for a one-page PDF promoting another product.

This option is primarily used when an Author unintentionally removes their Product from Users’ Leanpub libraries by making such changes. Our goal in these cases is to restore Users’ access to the original Product.

This does not establish a right for Users to access Time-of-Purchase Content, but we may offer it upon request.

### Restoring a Previous Version of a Product

We reserve the right to restore a previously published version of any Product. This could involve replacing the current version or publishing a new version based on an earlier one. We may also make changes such as altering a Product’s writing mode, setting up a new GitHub repository, or updating the description. Product States may be temporarily altered to facilitate this process (e.g., switching from Retired to Published and back).

This is typically done when an Author has unintentionally removed significant content, and our goal is to restore Users’ access to the Product.

### License Grant to Purchasers of Products

Leanpub Products, such as ebooks, are intangible digital goods. The rights you receive come directly from the Author or Organization and are granted as a license to use the Product, subject to these Terms. This includes all applicable copyright laws.

Upon purchasing a Product, you are granted the following rights:

* You may download and save the Product on any device for personal, non-commercial use.
    
* You may transfer the Product between your devices.
    
* You may not store the Product on publicly accessible servers (e.g., FTP or web servers).
    
* Your license is non-transferable.
    
* You may not sell the Product or transfer its associated rights.
    
* You may make a reasonable number of archival copies.
    
* If you made a “Multiple Copy Purchase,” you may distribute additional copies to intended recipients, who will also be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy.
    

Your rights to the Product remain valid as long as you comply with these Terms and retain a copy of the Product.

Leanpub Products are made available via download links or URLs, which may be sent via email or provided in your Leanpub account. Ruboss is not responsible for unauthorized sharing or misuse of download links.

#### Special Terms for Organizational Purchasers

If you are purchasing a Product on behalf of an organization for multiple readers:

* Both your organization and individual users are subject to the same terms as individual purchasers.
    
* You must purchase enough copies to cover the maximum number of users expected to access the Product.
    

#### Special Terms for Library Purchasers

Due to Leanpub’s focus on in-progress Books, library purchases can present challenges. If you wish to buy a Product for a library, you must contact the Author or Organization directly to arrange the purchase. This can be done separately from Leanpub.

#### Reselling Prohibited

Users are not permitted to purchase Products for resale. For example, a bookstore cannot buy a Leanpub book to resell it to a customer.

Author Services
---------------

Ruboss offers paid sets of services to authors (the “Author Services”). These services aim to save authors time in achieving specific goals, such as producing translations (TranslateAI service and GlobalAuthor bundles), creating courses (CourseAI service), or publishing print and ebook versions on Amazon KDP (Publish on Amazon service). The specific services provided are outlined at the time of purchase and may be modified at any time, at Ruboss’s sole discretion.

Author Services often utilize one or more external services, such as the OpenAI API or Amazon KDP, which introduces dependencies and limitations on their delivery. Ruboss is subject to the terms, availability, and policies of these third-party services. For instance, third-party services may delay or withhold royalties, reject products, or remove them entirely at their discretion, and Ruboss has no control over these actions.

While we strive to deliver Author Services promptly, repeated or frequent requests for changes or updates are not permitted. Typically, services such as publishing a Book on Amazon KDP involve a one-time effort, and ongoing changes after setup are not included.

Ruboss reserves the right to withdraw support for a purchased Author Service at any time, particularly if a User violates these Terms or the Terms of a third-party service. For example, if plagiarism is discovered, Ruboss may remove a Product from Amazon and halt royalty payments. There is no obligation to issue a refund in such cases.

Additionally, if an author purchases an Author Service for a book that includes copyrighted material (such as images), Ruboss will evaluate the situation. If it determines, at its sole discretion, that the use of copyrighted material was an _Innocent Mistake_, Ruboss may offer the author the opportunity to resolve the issue by removing the material or providing a refund. However, if Ruboss determines the issue was caused by _Deliberate Deception_, the author forfeits the cost of the service, as Ruboss incurred costs related to the discovery and resolution of the issue.

Leanpub Memberships
-------------------

Leanpub offers memberships (“Memberships”) that provide access to specific features and privileges.

### Types of Memberships

* Free Membership
    
* Reader Membership
    
* Standard Membership
    
* Pro Membership
    

Details on the features for each Membership are listed on the [Membership page](https://leanpub.com/membership). These features may change at any time, including the addition or removal of privileges, without notice.

### Membership Charges

Payments for Memberships are processed online through Ruboss’s services.

### Country Restrictions on Recurring Payments

Some countries may not allow recurring monthly billing. If this applies to your location, you cannot obtain a Membership requiring recurring payments.

### Membership Periods

Memberships expire after a set period (“Membership Period”), such as 365 days for annual Memberships. Once expired, Users must make another payment to regain access to Membership features.

### Cancelling Paid Memberships

You may cancel a paid Membership at any time, and your account will revert to Free Membership. For any concerns about the impact of cancellation, consult our [Help Center](http://help.leanpub.com/en) or contact hello@leanpub.com.

Ruboss reserves the right to cancel any free or paid Membership at any time for suspected violations of these Terms or other reasons at its discretion. If a scheduled payment is missed, the Membership may be canceled.

### Membership Pricing and Refunds

Membership prices are listed on our [Membership page](https://leanpub.com/membership). Refunds are processed according to our Refund Policy.

### Reader Membership Revenue Pool

Reader Memberships allow Users to purchase eligible Products for free. A portion of the Reader Membership payment is allocated to the Reader Membership Revenue Pool and distributed to eligible Authors based on purchases during the Membership Period.

### Opting In for Reader Membership Revenue Pool

Products can be opted in to receive revenue from the Reader Membership Revenue Pool. Ruboss may opt any Product out of this eligibility at its discretion, without notice.

The Partner Program
-------------------

Leanpub may partner with companies or organizations (“Partners”) to sell Leanpub Products via their own websites.

### Opting Out of the Partner Program

All Leanpub Products are opted in to the Partner Program by default. However, the Primary Author can opt out of the Partner Program on the Pricing page for each Product.

An Organization can choose for all its Products to be opted out of the Partner Program. Similarly, a User can choose for all Products where they are the Primary Author to be opted out of the Partner Program.

### Specific Terms for Each Partner

The terms of cooperation with each Partner are determined by individual contracts and are not publicly disclosed.

### General Terms for Partners

Partner websites may update Product details periodically, such as once a month (“Partner Updates”). This can result in a Partner selling a Leanpub Product with outdated details, such as an old Suggested Price, until the next update.

If a Product has multiple Packages, the default Package will be selected by the Partner for sale. This selection is also subject to Partner Updates.

Partners are permitted to display Product and Author information, such as the Author’s name, Leanpub profile, book title, cover image, etc., on their websites, apps, and social media.

Partner sales use free Coupon codes (multiple-use or single-use via API). Customers receive the Product on Leanpub via these coupons, ensuring they get updates like any other Leanpub customer.

Leanpub invoices Partners once per month based on the number of Coupons redeemed. If Coupon overuse occurs due to sharing, Partners are not held liable, and Authors will not receive compensation for overused Coupons.

The ordinary Royalty Rate applies to Partner Program purchases, just like with regular Leanpub sales.

### List of Partners

Currently, our only Partner is Learnerbly: https://www.learnerbly.com.

Payments to Leanpub
-------------------

### Payments for Content and Services

To purchase Products or Services through the Site, Users must pay using one of the third-party services we support (the “Purchase Payment Service” or “Purchase Payment Services”). Currently, Ruboss uses two Purchase Payment Services: PayPal and Stripe.

For their terms of service, please visit their respective websites:

* [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)
    
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
    

Ruboss is not responsible for any issues related to these Purchase Payment Services, including regional limitations or changes to service availability. Users in unsupported regions may not be able to make purchases.

It is the User’s responsibility to ensure their account information with the Purchase Payment Service is accurate and up to date. If issues arise, such as difficulty completing a purchase or receiving a refund, Users should contact the payment service’s customer support directly.

### Contributions

Leanpub allows Users to make financial contributions to support the platform’s mission of sustaining and improving its publishing services for a global community of readers and authors.

Contributions are one-time payments and are not considered charitable donations. All contributions are processed through the available payment methods and are subject to our Refund Policy.

Ruboss reserves the right to refuse or return any contribution at its discretion.

Royalty Payments from Leanpub
-----------------------------

To receive royalty payments, Users must use one of the third-party services supported by Ruboss (the “Royalty Payment Service” or “Royalty Payment Services”). Currently, Ruboss supports PayPal and Wise for royalty payments.

For terms of service, please visit their respective websites:

* [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)
    
* [Wise](https://wise.com/)
    

By default, royalties are paid via Wise, though Users may opt to receive payments via PayPal.

It is the User’s responsibility to ensure that all payment information provided to the Royalty Payment Service is accurate. Ruboss is not liable for losses resulting from incorrect account details.

### Royalty Payments via PayPal

If a specific PayPal email address has not been added to the User’s Leanpub account, Ruboss will attempt to send payments to the email address associated with the account. Payments are made in US Dollars.

Ruboss typically covers PayPal transaction fees, though in some cases, the User may be responsible for these fees. Additionally, Users are responsible for any other charges such as service or currency conversion fees applied by PayPal or other financial institutions.

Royalties via PayPal are processed in two ways:

1. **Mass Payment:** For payouts between $20 and $10,000.
    
2. **Individual Payment:** For special cases, with a minimum payout of $20.
    

### Royalty Payments via Wise

If a specific Wise email address has not been added to the User’s Leanpub account, Ruboss will attempt to send payments to the email address associated with the account. Payments are made in US Dollars by default, but Users can choose for Wise to convert into a large number of currencies. As with PayPal, Users are responsible for any service or currency exchange fees applied by Wise or financial institutions.

With Royalty Payments via Wise, the cost of sending the Wise payment is subtracted from your royalties. However, if you are converting from US Dollars into another currency, this is typically preferable to receiving the payment via PayPal.

### Minimum Royalty Payout Amount

The minimum royalty payment Ruboss will issue is $20 for PayPal and $100 for Wise. These thresholds may change at any time without notice.

Users may also set a higher minimum payout amount for their account. If a User’s earnings are below the threshold, the balance will roll over to the next month until the minimum payout amount is met.

### Reader Membership Revenue Pool Payments

Revenue from the Reader Membership Revenue Pool is paid separately from standard royalties. The minimum payout for this revenue is $100 (for both PayPal and Wise), though Users with a higher self-set minimum payout amount will follow that threshold.

To be clear, Reader Membership Revenue Pool revenue is only earned by Products which are Free With Membership. A Product is Free With Membership if it allows free purchases (for $0) AND if it requires those Users making the purchase to have a Membership (such as a Reader Membership or Author Membership). This is described further in the Reader Membership Revenue Pool Allocation section.

If a User or Organization has no Free With Membership Products, then they do not receive any Reader Membership Revenue Pool Payments.

### Royalty Payments to Co-Authors

For Products with multiple Authors, each will receive their share of royalties as specified by the Primary Author through the royalty structure set in the administrative interface. Changes to this structure apply only going forward, not retroactively.

### Royalty Hold Period

Leanpub offers a 60-day refund period for Products, and as such, royalties from purchases are held for at least 60 days before being paid out. This Royalty Hold Period allows for adjustments due to refunds, chargebacks or fraud.

Ruboss reserves the right to shorten or extend the Royalty Hold Period at its discretion without notice.

### Royalty Rates

Royalty rates depend on the price of the Product.

* For purchases of $7.99 or more, the royalty rate is 80%.
    
* For purchases between $0.99 and $7.98, the royalty rate is 80%, minus a $0.50 flat fee.
    

If a User’s account is inactive or terminated and Ruboss cannot contact them, Ruboss may charge a termination fee equal to the unpaid royalties.

### Reader Membership Revenue Pool Allocation

The Reader Membership Revenue Pool allocation is inherently quite complex. The simplest way to reduce the complexity is to simply not participate in any Reader Membership Revenue Pool allocation. If a User or Organization has no Free With Membership Products, then they do not receive any Reader Membership Revenue Pool Payments, and the complexity of the Reader Membership Revenue Pool allocation does not concern them.

50% of the revenue Ruboss receives from Reader Membership payments is allocated to a collective pool of revenue (the “Reader Membership Revenue Pool”), which is shared with eligible Leanpub Users, specifically the owners of Products opted in to this pool.

For monthly and annual Reader Memberships, the allocation from the Reader Membership Revenue Pool is based on the eligible Free purchases made by the User over a 365-day period (the “Reader Membership Allocation Period”), starting from the date of their first Reader Membership payment.

If a Reader Membership term is extended as part of a promotion, the Reader Membership Allocation Period is extended accordingly. For instance, if a promotional offer extends a Reader Membership to 15 months, the Allocation Period will also cover 15 months.

For Lifetime Reader Memberships, allocations from the Reader Membership Revenue Pool are based on the User’s eligible Free purchases over a 5-year period (the “Lifetime Reader Membership Allocation Period”), beginning from their first payment. Lifetime Reader Memberships function as five consecutive annual memberships, with the total revenue contribution from the Membership divided into five equal portions, distributed once each year for five years. This approach ensures fairness to authors by avoiding payout concentration in the first year or excessive delay. For example, if a Lifetime Membership is purchased for $99, then $49.50 of that goes to the Revenue Pool, divided into five portions of $9.90, allocated annually for five years. If the Membership sells for $200, $100 is allocated, and if it sells for $80, $40 is allocated, etc.

When a Reader Membership User makes a Free purchase of an eligible Product, a portion of their contribution to the Revenue Pool is assigned to the Product based on the Product’s Suggested Price at the time of purchase, and in relation to other Free purchases the User makes during their Allocation Period.

The weighting of a Product’s Suggested Price has limits. The minimum weighting used for calculations is the Product’s minimum non-free price, while the maximum weighting is $50.00. For instance, a Book with a Suggested Price of $0.00 will be weighted as $7.99, and a Book with a Suggested Price of $100 will be capped at $50.00 for weighting purposes.

At the end of the Reader Membership Allocation Period, the revenue is calculated for each eligible Product, and the amount is added to the Product owner’s unpaid earnings according to the Royalty split in place when the relevant purchase occurred. These earnings will be included in the next Royalty payout.

No allocations under one cent will be made to any Product or its owners. If a User exhausts their allocation from the Revenue Pool by purchasing enough Products, any additional Free purchases they make during the Membership Period will not contribute to the Revenue Pool.

Only one Free purchase per User per Product counts toward the allocation of revenue from the Pool. Multiple Free purchases of the same Product by the same User during the same or any subsequent Membership Period will only count once.

Ruboss reserves the right to adjust the Suggested Price weighting at its sole discretion. If Ruboss determines that a Product’s Suggested Price has been unfairly inflated to manipulate the Revenue Pool allocation, it may adjust the Suggested Price weighting accordingly. For instance, if a Product is priced at $1,000 without justification, Ruboss may apply a more reasonable weighting.

### Payment Attempt Failure

If a payment attempt fails, the amount will roll over to a future payout. Ruboss may suspend payments without notice after one or more failed payment attempts.

### Withholding Royalties and Suspending Payments

Ruboss reserves the right to withhold royalties or suspend payments at its discretion, particularly in cases involving legal action or violations of these Terms.

### Deducting Platform Costs from Royalties

Users may opt in to have Platform Costs (such as purchases of Author Services or Marketing Services) deducted from their royalties. These deductions are non-reversible.

### Chargebacks

A chargeback is typically where a customer contacts their credit card company and disputes a charge made on their account.

Leanpub almost never contests chargeback claims, since this is a battle we almost always lose. If a customer makes a chargeback, Ruboss will deduct the corresponding royalty payment(s) from the accounts of the relevant Author(s). If royalties have already been paid, Ruboss will deduct the amount from future royalty payments.

Since Leanpub has a generous 60 day refund policy, Ruboss reserves the right to suspend or terminate the account of any User which uses one or more chargebacks.

### Optional Royalty Payment via Wire Transfer Arrangement

Requests for royalty payments via wire transfer (the “Wire Transfer Arrangement”) will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Leanpub reserves the right to approve or discontinue a User’s participation in a Wire Transfer Arrangement at any time. All arrangements must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Certain individuals or countries may be excluded from this service based on regulatory or other considerations. The Wire Transfer Arrangement cannot be used to circumvent legal, regulatory, or other obligations.

The following conditions apply to any Wire Transfer Arrangement:

* **Fees:** To cover transaction, administrative, and other associated costs, a fee of **5% plus $50** will be applied to each wire transfer. For example, if the pre-fee royalty payment is $1,000, a 5% fee of $50 plus a $50 flat fee will be deducted, resulting in a transfer of $900.
    
* **User-Responsibility for Additional Fees:** The User is responsible for any extra fees imposed by their financial institution, including currency conversion fees or any other fees that may be applied as a condition of receiving the wire transfer.
    
* **Payment Frequency:** Wire transfer payments will be made no more than once per quarter. The payment schedule is subject to change at Leanpub’s discretion.
    
* **Minimum Payment Amount:** The minimum pre-fee amount eligible for wire transfer is $1,000. Payments below this amount will not be processed via wire transfer.
    

Refund Policy
-------------

Our Refund Policy is available [here](https://leanpub.com/refunds). By accepting these Terms, you also accept the Refund Policy. Ruboss may update this policy without notice, and it is the User’s responsibility to stay informed.

Types of Users
==============

List of User Types
------------------

In these Terms, Leanpub Users may be referenced according to their functions or responsibilities, as follows:

* **Account Holder**: The individual or organization that owns a Leanpub Account. An organization can hold an account through a designated representative.
    
* **Author**: A person who has created a Product on Leanpub.
    
* **Cause**: A non-profit or charitable organization included in the Leanpub for Causes program.

* **Reader**: A User who accesses a Product on Leanpub. This includes Users without a registered account.
    
* **Visitor**: Any person interacting with the Services (e.g., browsing the website or forums).
    

Primary Authors and Co-Authors
------------------------------

When a Product is created by a User, the User who creates it is automatically designated as the Primary Author of that Product. The Primary Author can perform tasks such as managing royalties, adding or removing Co-Authors, and other administrative actions allowed by Leanpub.

The Primary Author has the most administrative authority over a Product on Leanpub, except for Leanpub platform administrators. However, when a Product is created by or transferred to an Organization, the Organization Account Holder holds more administrative authority than the Primary Author.

The assignment of Primary Author status by Leanpub does not reflect any claim by Leanpub to ownership of copyright or other rights in the Product or Content. However, a User can only create a Product if they are the copyright holder or have the legal rights to do so. Therefore, when a User creates a Product and becomes its Primary Author, this implicitly represents a claim to ownership of the copyright or the necessary rights to the Product.

The Primary Author can transfer their status to another User. When this happens, the new User becomes the Primary Author with all its responsibilities, and the previous Primary Author becomes a Co-Author if they remain associated with the Product. Leanpub may also transfer Primary Author status at its discretion.

The Primary Author can assign Co-Author status to other Users, and Co-Authors must accept this role through Leanpub’s user interface. Assigning Co-Author status does not imply any statement about their copyright ownership or other rights in the Product.

If there is a dispute about authorship, Leanpub may investigate and take actions such as removing the Product or restricting access to it for both the Primary Author and any current or former Co-Authors.

### Revocation of Co-Author Status

The Primary Author can revoke Co-Author status at any time, and the Co-Author will no longer receive new royalties for the Product. This revocation does not affect previously earned royalties.

### Unilateral Royalty Reallocation

The Primary Author may unilaterally change the royalty allocation between themselves and any Co-Authors. These changes take effect going forward and do not affect royalties already earned.

### Disputes Between Authors

In case of disputes between Authors, Leanpub may investigate and take any necessary actions, such as retiring or removing the Product, or revoking access from one or more Authors, including the Primary Author and any Co-Authors.

Organizations
-------------

Organizations may include all types of entities, including companies, publishers, and universities. There are no separate terms for different types of Organizations, but the type of the Organization may be asked, and may affect how the Organization information is displayed on Leanpub.

The terms in this Terms of Service and the Leanpub Privacy Policy also apply to Organizations.

Organizations are responsible for managing any payments, including royalties or compensation, to authors, content creators, editors, and other individuals or entities they work with. Ruboss is not responsible for handling or mediating any financial or contractual disputes between an Organization and those it works with. Ruboss will only disburse royalties according to the royalty payment settings configured within the associated Leanpub Account. Any internal agreements or divisions of royalties among the Organization and its collaborators are the sole responsibility of the Organization and are outside of Ruboss’s control.

An Organization may have multiple addenda that specify additional terms, such as a non-sublicensable license, special account closure terms, indemnification terms or limitation of liability terms.

Causes
------

Authors and Organizations are free to assign a royalty percentage from their royalties on a particular Product to any Cause that has been approved as part of the Leanpub for Causes program, which allows Authors and Organizations to share royalties with a Cause (“Leanpub for Causes”, or the “Leanpub for Causes Program”). However, this does not imply any endorsement on the part of the Cause of the Author and/or Organization or the associated Product, Content, actions, or statements made by any party associated with the Product or its promotion or dissemination on Leanpub or elsewhere.

Royalties owed to Causes will be paid via PayPal using the PayPal email address associated with the Cause in the form used to register and maintain information about Causes.

Any User with the ability to change the royalty percentage owing to a Cause in association with the sale of a Product may change the royalty percentage owing to a Cause at any time and for any reason. Such changes have no effect on royalties owing prior to the change in the royalty percentage owing to the Cause.

Partners
--------

Partners will have a signed contract with Ruboss regarding their participation in our Partner Program. A Partner is not required to have an Account.

Content and Copyright
=====================

Copyright Take Down Policy
--------------------------

If you believe any materials on the Site infringe your copyright, you should notify Ruboss by submitting a copyright infringement claim. At its discretion, Ruboss will take appropriate action in accordance with our Copyright Take Down Policy, which governs how we respond to claims of copyright infringement.

The Copyright Take Down Policy can be found [here](https://leanpub.com/takedown). By accepting these Terms, you also accept the terms of the Copyright Take Down Policy.

To report an infringement, please follow the steps outlined in our Copyright Take Down Policy.

As a User, you agree:

* Not to post any Content that violates these Terms.
    
* Not to use the Services to harm anyone, including but not limited to Minors, in any way.
    
* Not to use “spam,” “blast-faxes,” or automated calls to market or sell Content or any other product or service.
    
* Not to interfere with the operation of the Site through the use of viruses, malicious software, or other disruptive technology.
    
* Not to employ a robot, spider, or other automated process to harvest email addresses or user information or to monitor activity on the Site.

As an Author or Organization, you agree that any Content made available for sale on the Site will comply with these Terms. In addition to complying with these Terms, you are responsible for adhering to all local and national laws in your jurisdiction.

Ruboss may, at its discretion, refuse or remove any Content it deems inappropriate, illegal, offensive, or harmful, or that misrepresents the Content’s nature or progress. We may also remove Content or Products and reassign URLs if we determine a project has been abandoned. For example, if you reserve a valuable URL like `leanpub.com/computers` but fail to publish, we may reclaim it.

At our discretion, we may ban Users or remove Content that violates our policies or that we deem suspicious. Ruboss reserves the right to modify policies at any time without notice.

Copyright, Creative Commons, Public Domain, Disputed Content, and Related Policies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leanpub is committed to ensuring that Content published through the platform aligns with its mission. To maintain this focus, we have established strict policies that govern the use of Content on Leanpub.

VIOLATING ANY OF THE POLICIES IN THIS SECTION MAY RESULT IN ACCOUNT SUSPENSION OR DELETION (INCLUDING ALL ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS), AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

### Copyright Holders Only

Only the holder of the copyright for any Content may use Leanpub to publish that Content.

This policy applies not only to the contents of a Product but to any other Content, such as a User’s profile or a Product’s “About” information.

### Standard Copyright License

Leanpub Authors or Organizations retain the copyright to their work. Leanpub does not claim ownership of the copyright for Products or any other Content created or sold on Leanpub. By default, Leanpub Books are published under a standard copyright license belonging to the Author(s) or Organization(s).

### Creative Commons Policy

Leanpub allows Authors and Organizations to choose a Creative Commons License for their work as an alternative to the default copyright license.

However, you may only publish under a Creative Commons License if you own the copyright for the Content. Publishing Creative Commons works that you do not own, even if the license permits distribution elsewhere, is not allowed.

This policy supports the Creative Commons process by ensuring that the original work remains identifiable, especially for in-progress Products. A flood of similar or identical copies of Creative Commons works could harm the ability of the original Author(s) to profit from their work and receive valuable feedback.

### Public Domain Book Publishing Policy

Leanpub allows the sale of Public Domain works only if they are significantly differentiated from the original or other versions. To be considered significantly differentiated, a Product must include unique contributions such as a new translation, original illustrations, or annotations.

Annotations must be the original work of the User or Users publishing the Product and can include essay introductions, study guides, or literary critiques.

Leanpub reserves the right to reject any Public Domain Product it does not deem sufficiently differentiated. Public Domain Products must also include a clear indication of their nature in the Product title (e.g., “Translated,” “Annotated,” “Illustrated”).

### Copyright Infringement is Strictly Prohibited

If Ruboss determines that any part of a Product infringes on the copyright of others, it may take immediate action, including halting the sale of the Product or deleting the offending Book or Package. Ruboss may also suspend or delete the account responsible for the infringement if warranted.

Ruboss reserves the right to withhold revenue or refund all refundable purchases if it determines that a violation of these Terms has occurred. This action is taken at Ruboss’s sole discretion.

Account Holders Authorize Ruboss to Send DMCA Takedown Notices on Your Behalf
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By using Leanpub, Account Holders authorize Ruboss to act as one of their DMCA copyright representatives. Ruboss is permitted, but not obligated, to send DMCA Takedown notices on behalf of Account Holders while their Product is available for sale in the Leanpub Bookstore. Ruboss reserves the right to send DMCA Takedown notices at its discretion, particularly in cases involving significant copyright violations.

### Use of Licensed Images from Third-Party Services

Leanpub permits the use of images sourced from Unsplash’s free image collection, provided that the use complies with Unsplash’s free image license. This license allows for both commercial and non-commercial use without the need for attribution (though attribution is appreciated).

**Unsplash+ images, or images from similar paid licensing services such as iStock, are not permitted on Leanpub.** This restriction helps avoid any potential licensing issues that could arise from specific usage limitations imposed by paid services like Unsplash+. Authors are responsible for ensuring that all images used in their Products fully comply with the free usage license offered by Unsplash or other similar services.

This policy removes the need for verifying the existence or terms of paid licenses, ensuring compliance with Leanpub’s content guidelines.

To clarify:

* **Unsplash Free images**: Allowed, provided they adhere to the free image license terms.
    
* **Unsplash+ images and similar paid services such as iStock**: Not permitted.
    

### Death of Copyright Holder

If the copyright owner of Content published on Leanpub dies, ownership of the Content passes to their legal successor. The new copyright holder assumes all rights of the Primary Author, including the ability to keep the Content for sale, retire it, or take any other action permitted to a Primary Author. Leanpub will not lock the Account or unpublish any Products upon the death of a copyright owner.

Disputed Content
----------------

Ruboss does not mediate copyright disputes. Such matters are for the involved parties to resolve themselves or in court. If Ruboss becomes aware that any Content is involved in a dispute over copyright or intellectual property rights (“Disputed Content”), we may take action to limit our exposure to the dispute.

For example, Ruboss may change the Product’s status to “Forcibly Retired” or restrict access to Leanpub for Users associated with the Disputed Content. In some cases, we may delete the Content or the Users’ Accounts entirely. Ruboss may also withhold royalties associated with Disputed Content and refund any refundable purchases of the Content. At our discretion, we may also remove the Disputed Content from Users’ Leanpub libraries.

Ruboss’s actions regarding Disputed Content are not judgments or declarations about the ownership of the Content or any User’s involvement in infringing activity. Instead, they are precautionary measures to limit Ruboss’s exposure to legal risk in cases where the ownership of Content is unclear.

If a Product URL becomes associated with Disputed Content, it may no longer be available for use on Leanpub, even for unrelated new content or by other Users.

Erotica
-------

Leanpub has specific rules and features that apply to Content categorized as Erotica, with additional restrictions to ensure compliance with legal standards and to prevent access by Minors.

### Identification and Age Verification

Products containing mature or erotic material must be categorized as Erotica. These Books will appear in their own Category lists and will not be included in the main Leanpub bestseller lists or first published lists. The Erotica Category is protected by an age verification process to prevent access by Minors.

### Packages Including Erotica

Packages containing Erotica are not permitted. Authors are prohibited from adding Extras to Books categorized under the Erotica genre. This includes, but is not limited to, restrictions on video, audio, artwork, or other digital Extras. If any Extra in a Package is deemed inappropriate or falls under the Erotica genre, the entire Package may be removed at Ruboss’ sole discretion. Violations could lead to further actions, including suspension of the Author’s Account.

### Bundles Including Erotica

If a Bundle includes a Product categorized as Erotica, the entire Bundle will be categorized as Erotica. Non-Erotica books included in such a Bundle will only be subject to restrictions and age verification when part of the Bundle. These restrictions do not affect the non-Erotica Book when sold independently. Erotica Bundles will only appear in the Erotica category and will be subject to age verification.

### Images

Books categorized as Erotica are not allowed to contain any images within their manuscripts. Leanpub’s book generator will automatically ignore image tags in Erotica manuscripts. This ensures that no inappropriate or copyrighted images are included. The only image allowed in an Erotica book is the cover image (“Book Cover”). The Book Cover must be appropriate for a PG-13 audience and cannot be erotic or mature in nature.

To prevent the inclusion of images in directly uploaded books, all Erotica books must be generated through the Leanpub book generator.

Ruboss reserves the right to remove any Content that violates these terms and may take additional actions as necessary.

### Prohibited Content

Leanpub supports free speech and artistic expression but strictly prohibits certain types of content. Pornographic images or videos, graphic depictions of sexual acts, or any erotic content involving minors are strictly forbidden. Leanpub is firmly against child pornography and prohibits any Content featuring minors in an erotic context.

Other prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, crime scene imagery, depictions of animal cruelty, or similarly disturbing content. These materials cannot be uploaded, sold, or distributed via the Leanpub platform.

Ruboss reserves the right to remove any inappropriate Content and take further action against the Authors or Organizations responsible for violations. While global standards of acceptability may differ, Ruboss retains the sole discretion to determine what Content is appropriate for sale on the Leanpub platform.

### Exclusion of Erotica from AI Services

Content categorized as Erotica is ineligible for AI Services.

Fan Fiction
-----------

Fan Fiction refers to fiction that uses characters, settings, or other recognizable content from an existing work, such as a TV show, movie, book, or other media, created by someone other than the Author of the Fan Fiction.

**Fan Fiction is not permitted on Leanpub.**

This prohibition is due to the complex legal issues surrounding copyright and derivative works. Fan Fiction often constitutes a derivative work, which may infringe on the original copyright holder’s rights. As a result, Leanpub does not allow the sale or distribution of Fan Fiction to avoid potential copyright violations, even if no payment is involved.

Bad Products
------------

Leanpub encourages creative expression but must maintain standards to protect its platform and its Users. Occasionally, a User may publish a Product with minimal original content or use the platform in a way that could harm Leanpub’s reputation or its Users. These are referred to as “Bad Products.”

If Ruboss determines that a Product qualifies as a Bad Product, it reserves the right to take any necessary actions to resolve the situation. These actions may include deleting the Product, changing its status (e.g., from Published to Unpublished), or taking other corrective actions without prior notice to the User.

In addition to addressing the Product, Ruboss may take action against any User deemed responsible for creating or distributing a Bad Product. This may include suspending or deleting the User’s account, depending on the severity of the violation.

Examples of Bad Products may include, but are not limited to:

* Products with little or no original content.
    
* Products created to mislead or deceive Users.
    
* Products intended to damage Leanpub’s platform or other Users’ experiences.
    

Joke Products
-------------

Leanpub recognizes that some Users may create Products or User pages intended as jokes or pranks (referred to as “Joke Products”). While humor and creativity are welcomed, Leanpub retains the right to prevent Joke Products from negatively impacting the platform or its Users.

If Ruboss determines that a Product is a Joke Product or a related action is a joke, it may take action to mitigate any negative effects. This can include unpublishing or retiring the Product, restricting its sale to free-only, or taking other actions as deemed necessary.

Leanpub reserves the right to address Joke Products without notifying the User in advance. The platform will prioritize maintaining the integrity and user experience on Leanpub over the continuation of any Joke Products.

SEO or Advertising of Non-Leanpub Products or Services is Prohibited
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Leanpub is a platform dedicated to the creation, publication, and promotion of Leanpub Products and Authors. It is also a marketplace for discovering Leanpub Authors and purchasing their Products.

It is prohibited to use Leanpub for any unrelated primary purpose, including but not limited to, conducting search engine optimization (SEO) or promoting non-Leanpub products or services (collectively referred to as “Banned Promotional Activity”).

If Ruboss determines, at its sole discretion, that a User is engaged in Banned Promotional Activity, we reserve the right to suspend the User’s account without prior notification.

Prohibition on Malware Development, Website Audits, and Security Vulnerability Disclosures
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leanpub welcomes Products that discuss computer security as a general topic. However, Leanpub cannot be used as a platform for disclosing specific security vulnerabilities, performing website audits, or teaching malware development.

Disclosures of security vulnerabilities should be made privately to the relevant parties, rather than publicly on Leanpub.

This restriction applies to all Content, including a User’s profile or a Product’s “About” information, and is in effect regardless of the Product’s state (e.g., unpublished, stealth mode, or published).

Any activity deemed by Ruboss, at its sole discretion, to violate this policy may result in the removal of the Product and potential suspension of the User’s account, without prior notice.

If you are unsure whether your Content complies with these Terms, please contact us at hello@leanpub.com for guidance before publishing.

Rights to Content Posted on the Site
------------------------------------

### Ruboss Property

Ruboss owns all intellectual property rights associated with Leanpub, including but not limited to copyrights, patents, and trademarks, as well as the design, format, and layout of the Site. This excludes Content owned by third parties. Users of the Site are authorized to use the Site and copy materials posted on the Site for personal, non-commercial use, provided that all copyright notices remain intact. Any other uses are prohibited. Ruboss retains all rights, title, and ownership to the materials posted on the Site.

The Leanpub logo and the names of Leanpub products and services are trademarks of Ruboss. Users are prohibited from using the Leanpub logo on any Product, such as on the cover or landing page image, to avoid any implication of endorsement.

### License Grant to Ruboss

When you post Content on Leanpub, you retain your rights to that Content, but you grant Ruboss specific rights depending on the type of Content.

For Content that is available for sale or distribution on Leanpub, you grant Ruboss a fully transferable, fully sublicensable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to copy, reproduce, print, publish, and distribute the Content solely in connection with the Services, as long as the Product is available on Leanpub. If desired, Organizations or Users may negotiate an addendum to make the license non-sublicensable.

For other types of Content, such as comments on Forums, you grant Ruboss a fully transferable, fully sublicensable, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license to use that Content to operate, promote, and improve the Services.

If you wish to negotiate an agreement that restricts sublicensing rights, you can contact Ruboss to discuss and enter into a special addendum for a non-sublicensable arrangement.

### Permissions Agreement for Forum or Email Content

When you post on the Forums or use the “Email the Author(s)” form, the following Permissions Agreement applies:

1. **Licensed Materials**: This applies to text, source code, or other materials posted in the Forum or via email.
    
2. **License**: You grant the recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use the materials in their work, including derivative works, in all media, worldwide, and in perpetuity.
    
3. **Use of Materials**: The recipient may edit and use the materials as they see fit, with or without attribution.
    
4. **Compensation**: No compensation is provided for the use of the materials.
    
5. **Warranties**: You warrant that you own the rights to the materials and indemnify the recipient from any claims related to the materials.
    

### Abusive Speech

Any User engaging in abusive speech or actions through Leanpub, or contacting Leanpub Users or Ruboss staff abusively, may have their account suspended or blocked.

If Ruboss determines that a User has engaged in abusive speech, we may suspend or terminate the User’s account. We may also take additional measures, such as blocking the User’s email from contacting Leanpub or its Authors.

This policy applies to interactions outside the Site as well. If we discover abusive speech directed at Leanpub staff or Users on external platforms, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate the User’s Leanpub account.

Ruboss has sole discretion in determining what constitutes abusive speech. Examples include racist remarks or threats of violence. We may enforce this policy without any warning or communication.

### Code of Conduct and Personal Attacks

Leanpub Products and public repositories must not be used to make defamatory statements or personal attacks. This is particularly true if Personally Identifying Information is included, allowing someone to be identified.

If Ruboss determines that these Terms have been violated, we may delete the offending book or repository, and potentially terminate any associated accounts.

Leanpub is not to be used as a platform for interpersonal disputes, and any misuse of the platform in this way will not be tolerated.

Promotions and Third-Party Services
===================================

Advertisements
--------------

### Third-Party Advertisements

The Services may include third-party advertisements, which can be targeted based on Content, queries, or other information related to the Services. The types and extent of advertising displayed by Ruboss on the Services may change without notice. By using the Services, you agree that Ruboss and its third-party providers may place such advertising on the Services or alongside the Content, whether submitted by you or others.

These advertisements can include, but are not limited to, promotions for other Leanpub books or relevant products, even if they are related to your Content. For instance, if you publish a book about cheese, Ruboss reserves the right to display advertisements for other cheese-related books or products on the pages related to your book.

Ruboss disclaims any liability for losses or damages resulting from the advertisements displayed on the Site.

### Placements on The Shelf and in Leanpub Newsletters

Primary Authors can choose to advertise their Products via a Placement on the Leanpub homepage (a “Shelf Spot”) or in Leanpub newsletters. Currently, purchasing a Shelf Spot includes a Placement in newsletters, though this may change, and they may be purchasable separately in the future.

Placements are available for specific terms, such as one week or one month. Sometimes, Leanpub offers free Placements as part of other promotions.

Ruboss reserves the right to change the terms of any Placement (whether free or paid) at its discretion. Placements are non-refundable and non-transferable.

A Product can only be included in a Placement if it is in a published state and is not under embargo or other restrictions. If the Product’s state changes to an incompatible status (e.g., unpublished), it will be removed from the Placement without refund.

Ruboss also reserves the right to remove a Product from a Placement at any time. For example, if a Product or its Author violates these Terms, the Product may be removed from the Placement.

Marketing
---------

Ruboss has sole discretion over all marketing and promotions within the Leanpub Site and Services. This may include offering portions of Products for free to prospective customers, displaying Product images in Leanpub advertisements, or promoting Products on social media platforms like Facebook.

Ruboss may also promote Products for sale on Leanpub in external locations, such as physical venues or online platforms, without charging the Author or Organization. Similarly, Ruboss will not be charged by the Author or Organization for this type of promotion. This includes the use of Author or Organization names, avatars, logos, or other representations in marketing materials.

There is no obligation for Ruboss to market or promote any specific Content or Product, and Ruboss may stop promoting a Product at any time.

Content Modification
--------------------

Ruboss engages in marketing activities that include social media posts, email newsletters, and similar channels. Each platform or service we use may present Content, such as book cover images, differently depending on their formats and settings. Additionally, these platforms may change how they present Content without notice. We summarize and display Content in a manner we believe is fair and accurate.

For AI-generated translations, we currently modify the cover image by adding a banner indicating that the book is an AI translation.

Outside of these specific activities, Ruboss does not significantly modify any Content provided by the Author or Organization.

Review Copies and Desk Copies
-----------------------------

At its discretion, Ruboss may distribute up to 100 free copies of any Product for promotional purposes each year. Common use cases include:

* Requests for “desk copies” from academics or educational institutions.
    
* Providing free access to customers as part of customer service.
    
* Giveaway promotions for meetup groups or user groups.
    

Distributing Your Leanpub-Generated Product Content Using Other Services
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leanpub does not restrict Authors or Organizations from distributing the Content they create on Leanpub (the “Leanpub-Generated Content”) on other platforms. For example, you are free to sell a Book on Leanpub and simultaneously sell it elsewhere or distribute it through another platform, at any price.

You are responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of any other services you use for publishing or distributing your Content. Some platforms may have their own restrictions or pricing rules, so be sure to verify that your distribution is in accordance with their policies.

However, to use Leanpub for distribution, you must ensure:

* You own the copyright to the Content or have the legal rights to publish it.
    
* You are authorized to distribute the Content using Leanpub globally.
    
* You are not restricted by any agreements or terms from using Leanpub to publish, sell, or distribute your Content.

Limitation of Liability
=======================

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RUBOSS AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS (OTHER THAN CONTENT CONTRIBUTORS GRANTING LICENSES PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, OPPORTUNITY, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT RUBOSS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

You agree that the liability of Ruboss, its officials, employees, affiliates, and agents, if any, arising out of any kind of legal claim (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) in any way connected with any transaction entered hereunder or the Site or Services shall not exceed the amount you paid to Ruboss in connection with the transaction giving rise to such claim.

Any action under these Terms must be commenced within one (1) year of knowledge or discovery of the cause of action.

The foregoing limitation applies to the acts, omissions, negligence, and gross negligence of Ruboss, its officers, employees, affiliates, and agents which, but for this provision, would give rise to the cause of action against Ruboss in contract, tort, or any other legal doctrine. Your sole and exclusive remedies under these Terms are as expressly set out in these Terms.

Requesting a Special Limitation of Liability Addendum
-----------------------------------------------------

Some Users, such as those with Organization Accounts, may require custom terms regarding limitation of liability. For example, a publishing company may wish to negotiate such terms.

To request a special limitation of liability addendum, please send an email to [hello@leanpub.com](mailto:hello@leanpub.com). Any negotiated addendum will be incorporated into your agreement with Ruboss.

General Legal Provisions
========================

Chief Compliance Officer
------------------------

Ruboss has a Chief Compliance Officer (the “CCO”) who serves as the point of contact for enforcing these Terms and ensuring Ruboss’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CCO is responsible for responding to reasonable reports of potential violations of these Terms and addressing issues with Users regarding possible violations or actions taken by Ruboss in response to such violations.

The CCO also acts as Ruboss’s Agent of Notice and Data Protection Officer.

To contact the Ruboss CCO, send an email to [hello@leanpub.com](mailto:hello@leanpub.com) with the subject line: “Attention: Chief Compliance Officer.” For postal communication, use the address listed at the end of these Terms.

Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk. You agree that the Site and Services are provided on an “AS-IS” and “AS-AVAILABLE” basis. RUBOSS AND ITS PARTNERS DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Ruboss makes no warranty and disclaims liability for the completeness, accuracy, availability, security, or reliability of the Site or Services. Ruboss is not responsible for any harm to your computer system, data loss, or other damage from your use of the Site or Services. There is no warranty that the Site or Services will meet your expectations or be available uninterrupted, securely, or error-free. No advice or information from Ruboss, whether oral or written, creates any warranty not explicitly stated in these Terms. Ruboss may modify Leanpub features, availability, operation, and appearance without notice.

Links
-----

The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that Ruboss is not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content of such websites or resources. Links to third-party sites do not imply endorsement by Ruboss. You assume all risk arising from your use of any linked websites or resources.

Third-Party Websites, Software, and Services
--------------------------------------------

The Site and Services may use plug-ins or direct you to websites, software, or services owned or operated by third parties (“Third Party Properties”). Ruboss has no control over Third Party Properties, including their content, operation, privacy practices, and costs. The fact that the Site directs you to such properties does not indicate Ruboss’s approval or endorsement.

You assume all risks and costs associated with Third Party Properties, including applicable fees and service charges. We encourage you to review their terms of use and practices before engaging with them.

Indemnification
---------------

You agree to indemnify and hold Ruboss harmless against all third-party claims, losses, costs, damages (including direct, indirect, and consequential damages), legal fees, and expenses arising from any breach of these Terms or any act or omission by you related to your use of the Site or Services.

### Requesting a Special Indemnification Addendum

Certain Users, such as those with Organization Accounts, may require custom indemnification terms. To request a special indemnification addendum, please email [hello@leanpub.com](mailto:hello@leanpub.com). Any negotiated addendum will be incorporated into your agreement with Ruboss.

Exclusions
----------

Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion of warranties or liability limitations for certain types of damages. If you are located in such a jurisdiction, these exclusions may not apply to you. The limitations only apply where allowed by law.

Waiver and Severability
-----------------------

Ruboss’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision. If any part of these Terms is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
--------------------------------

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, without regard to conflict of law provisions. All legal proceedings related to the Services will take place in Victoria, British Columbia, and you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts. However, Ruboss reserves the right to seek remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Miscellaneous
=============

Artificial Inflation of Sales Counts
------------------------------------

Artificially inflating sales counts (“Artificial Sales Inflation”) for Products is strictly prohibited. This violation of our Terms may result in Account suspension or termination at Ruboss’s sole discretion. Examples of Artificial Sales Inflation include, but are not limited to, making free purchases of your own Book using fake or unused email accounts. The determination of whether Artificial Sales Inflation has occurred will be made solely by Ruboss.

If we suspect that Artificial Sales Inflation is associated with a Product, we may, without obligation to notify you, suspend that Product’s availability for purchase. Additionally, Ruboss reserves the right to cancel any purchase deemed or suspected to be linked to Artificial Sales Inflation.

The Leanpub API
---------------

The Leanpub API is intended for the personal, non-commercial use of Leanpub Users. Its use may be restricted to Users with a paid Membership. “Personal, non-commercial use” means that a User may use the Leanpub API for their own Products (e.g., to preview and publish them, view sales, and generate coupons), but the API may not be used to build and sell software.

Ruboss reserves the right to revoke access to the Leanpub API for any User, at any time, and for any reason.

Use of Your Content to Develop and Improve AI Services
------------------------------------------------------

Ruboss may use third-party services, such as OpenAI, in providing AI Services. By using AI Services, you consent to Ruboss using your Content for the development and improvement of its proprietary in-house procedures, including prompt engineering and related technologies.

Restrictions on Account Names, Usernames, Product Names, and URL Slugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Users are not required to use their legal names for their Account names or usernames. However, there are restrictions on Account names, Usernames, Product names, and URL slugs (the part of the web address after the domain) that Users are permitted to use.

Users may not use trademarked words or the names of real people or organizations in Account or Product names, or in URL slugs, unless they can demonstrate the right to do so. Additionally, parody Accounts or Products using such names are not permitted on Leanpub.

For clarity, this restriction includes the word “Leanpub,” which is a registered trademark of Ruboss. Users may not use “Leanpub” or any variation (e.g., leanpub, LeanPub, leanPub) in Account names, Usernames, Product names, or URL slugs. This restriction helps protect our trademark and reduce confusion among Users.

Creating misleading URL slugs or engaging in “squatting” by reserving URL slugs without intending to publish a related Product is also prohibited.

Ruboss reserves the right to “reserve” certain URL slugs and may retroactively reserve a URL slug even after a User has created a Product with it.

Ruboss may, at its sole discretion and without notification, change any URL slugs that violate these restrictions. Additionally, if a Name or URL slug is found to be in violation, Ruboss may rename or close the associated Account or Product and refund any purchases linked to the violation.

International Users
-------------------

Ruboss makes no representations about the appropriateness or availability of the Site or Services outside Canada and the United States. You may not use the Site or export Content in violation of U.S. export regulations. If you access the Site from outside Canada or the U.S., you are responsible for complying with all applicable local laws and paying any local taxes required.

Promotion of Specific Cryptocurrencies is Prohibited
----------------------------------------------------

While Leanpub welcomes Products that discuss cryptocurrencies in general, promoting specific cryptocurrencies on Leanpub is prohibited. Such promotion would be considered a form of advertising, even if the Author or Authors are not being directly compensated for their work.

This restriction applies not only to the contents of a Product but also to any Content, such as User profiles or Product “About” information.

Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy
----------------------------------

While Leanpub values feedback from its Users, Ruboss will not compensate individuals for solicited or unsolicited ideas regarding improvements to the Site or Services. Any ideas submitted to Leanpub or Ruboss become the property of Ruboss. This policy helps prevent confusion when new ideas are implemented on the Site or Services. Ruboss is not obligated to use submitted materials or ideas.

Entire Agreement
================

These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, and Copyright Take Down Policy, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between Ruboss and you regarding the Services. This agreement supersedes and replaces any prior agreements between you and Ruboss concerning the Services, unless a separate agreement explicitly states otherwise and is in addition to or replaces these Terms.

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to be bound by these Terms, you must terminate your Account.

These Terms are binding, and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to them.
