Copyright Take Down Policy
==========================

_This Copyright Take Down Policy Policy is effective as of April 21, 2010, and was last updated on October 7, 2024. This policy may be updated from time to time, and we recommend users check it regularly._

Infringement Warning
====================

Ruboss respects copyright and intellectual property rights, and we expect all users of the leanpub.com website (the “Site”) to do the same. Allegedly infringing materials on the Site may be removed or suspended at any time, in accordance with the Terms of Service. Repeated infringement by a user of the Site (the “User”) may, in appropriate circumstances, result in a termination of that User’s access to and use of the Site.

Leanpub is based in Canada and we comply with Canadian copyright law, which is based on a “Notice and Notice” regime. While we are extremely serious about taking down infringing or potentially infringing Content as soon as possible upon notification or discovery of such Content, please note that we are not legally required to do so upon receipt of a Notification of Infringement.

Before sending a Notification of Infringement or a Counter-Notification, we recommend you read this entire page and our Terms of Service.

Notification of Infringement
============================

If you believe that any of your work has been copied or published or has otherwise been used in connection with the Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement or is otherwise an infringement of your intellectual property rights, please provide Ruboss’s Agent for Notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement (the “Agent for Notice”) with the following information:

1. The name and address of the claimed owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest (the “Claimant”);
    
2. An electronic or physical signature of the Claimant, or the person authorized to act on their behalf;
    
3. Identification of the material that is subject to the claimant’s copyright and is allegedly infringed, including a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
    
4. The date on which the alleged infringement was discovered, and/or an indication that the alleged infringement is current, at the date and time of notification;
    
5. A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site, including at least one Internet address, and with enough detail that we may find it on the Site;
    
6. A statement of the Claimant’s rights or interests in relation to the related Content, for example a claim of copyright ownership of the Content;
    
7. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and
    
8. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner, or authorized to act on the Claimant’s behalf.
    

A Notification of Infringement **must not** contain any of the following:

* Any offer to settle the claim of infringement
    
* Any request, demand, or offer regarding payment or the release of personal information, in relation to the claim of infringement
    
* Any reference, such as a hyperlink, to such a request, demand, or offer not included in the Notification of Infringement
    
* Any other information that is proscribed by regulation
    

**Under Canadian law, Ruboss is required to forward a complete copy of a compliant Notification of Infringement to the alleged infringing person or persons, including the name and address of the Claimant.**

**Under Canadian law, upon receipt of a compliant Notification of Infringement, Ruboss is not required to take down or otherwise restrict access to Content on the Site.**

Counter-Notification
====================

Under Canada’s “Notice and Notice” regime, there is no requirement to provide a person or persons affected by a Notification of Infringement with an opportunity to submit a Counter-Notification. However, we have elected to give Users the opportunity to submit a Counter-Notification to help us resolve issues regarding claims concerning copyright and intellectual property ownership. Receipt of a Counter-Notification does not bind Ruboss to any legal obligations, and our intention is for the Counter-Notification to be used only for the purposes of our internal deliberations. Unless we are obliged to do so through a legal process, we will not release the information in the Counter-Notification to the Claimant or the Claimant’s representative or representatives.

If you elect to send us a Counter-Notification (for example, in the event that, in response to a notice of its infringement, we have taken down or disabled access to material that you have contributed to the Site), to be effective it must be a written communication provided to our Agent for Notice that includes the following:

1. The name and address of the claimed owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest (the “Counter-Claimant”);
    
2. An electronic or physical signature of the Counter-Claimant, or the person authorized to act on their behalf;
    
3. Identification of the material that is subject to the Claimant’s Notification of Infringement, including a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property subject to the claim of infringement;
    
4. A description of where the alleged infringing material is (or was, if we have disabled access to it) located on the Site, including at least one Internet address, and with enough detail that we may find it on the Site;
    
5. A statement of the Counter-Claimant’s rights or interests in relation to the related Content, for example a claim of copyright ownership of the Content;
    
6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner, or authorized to act on the Claimant’s behalf.
    

Such Counter-Notification should be sent to Ruboss’s Agent for Notice as follows:

By Mail
-------

1 Ruboss Technology Corporation
2 1321 Blanshard Street
3 Suite 301
4 Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
5 V8W 0B6

By Email

[hello@leanpub.com](mailto:hello@leanpub.com)

To repeat, unless we are obliged to do so through a legal process, we will not release the information in the Counter-Notification to the Claimant or the Claimant’s representative or representatives.
