#### Privacy Policy

##### What data is collected?

Forms that collect your personal data on our web site have associated privacy policies that explain in detail why data is collected and what is done with it.

In particular, we collect personal data in contact forms, support forms, in the quote generator and the trial extension forms. Also, when you purchase a license, your personal data is saved in a database.

In addition to the data entered in a form, an anonymized IP address may be collected. Form data may be stored in a database, an email ticketing system and email accounts.

##### Why is data collected?

The collected data is only used for the indicated purpose and related follow-ups:

* In contact and support forms, the data is used to follow up on your questions and feedback. We will not send you any marketing emails based on your input in these forms.
* In the quote generator, the data is used to prepare a quote and send it to you per email. No further emails will be sent based on this interaction.
* In the trial extension forms, the data is used to send you an evaluation key by email. One follow-up email related to the evaluation and news about major releases with a maximum frequency of once per year may be sent.
* When you purchase a license through any channel, the licensing email is sent to the email address that you specified during your purchase. One follow-up email related to the purchase and news about new significant releases may be sent. Your order data will be stored indefinitely.

##### How can I opt-out of email communication?

##### How is data hosted and content delivered?

We use the service “Cloudflare”. The transfer of information between your browser and our website is routed through Cloudflare’s content delivery network network. Cloudflare analyzes traffic between your browser and our website and filters out potentially malicious traffic from the Internet. In doing so, Cloudflare may also use cookies, but these are used solely for the purpose described here.

We have entered into an order processing agreement with Cloudflare. Cloudflare is also a certified participant of the “EU-US Privacy Shield Framework”. Cloudflare has committed to handling all personal data received from European Union (EU) member states in accordance with the “Privacy Shield Framework”.
