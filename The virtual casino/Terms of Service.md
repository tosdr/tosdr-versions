7\. In case a slot tournament is canceled, the buy-in will be refunded to the player’s account.  
  
8\. For selected tournaments add-ons and re-buys are available. An add-on will give players additional time and credit to participate in the tournament and can only be purchased during tournament play. Re-buys allow players to enter the tournament again with a starting point balance of 0.  
  
9\. Prices, values and rake are variable and determined by the Casino. The maximum number of times a player can perform an add-on or re-buy is indicated in the Tournament Entry Requirements.  
  
10\. Unless otherwise specified, cash winnings from any tournament are subject to a 1x playthrough (Slots and Keno Only) and 1x max cashout requirement.  
  
11\. Points accrued during slot tournament gameplay contribute to the points table of the slot tournament only, and do not represent real money wins outside of the tournament, even if a jackpot or special feature is won.

12\. The Player may not play in consecutive Free Roll tournaments. Should a Player play in one Free Roll tournament, the Player must make a real money deposit into his account to be eligible to play in a second Free Roll tournament.

ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO SLOT TOURNAMENT
----------------------------------------------

### Free Roll Tournaments:

* Free Roll Tournaments are Tournaments which do not require that players pay a registration fee.
* Prizes won in a Free Roll Tournament are added to cash balances and may be withdrawn from the casino.
* Any winnings from Free Roll Slot Tournaments may be used to play in real money casino games. These winnings are subject to a 1x playthrough and 1x max cashout requirement.

### Tournament Credits:

* At the start of every Tournament, Tournament Credits are allocated for the duration of the Tournament.
* The player with the highest number of credits at the end of the Tournament time is the winner.
* Tournament Credits are not transferable to your casino balance and are not valid outside of the Tournament games.
* Tournament credits differ from your Casino Balance and may not be withdrawn from the casino.
* Wagers placed on Slot Tournament games using Tournament Credits will not count towards any wager requirements.

### Password Restricted Tournaments:

Some Tournaments will require a password in order to be unlocked ('Restricted Tournaments'). These passwords can be provided to players exclusively by the casino. Passwords and subsequent Tournament Entries gained by using a password from sources other than the casino will not constitute a valid entry to the Restricted Tournament and will disqualify any winnings accrued during the course of this Tournament. Players who use passwords not sent by the casino may have their casino accounts suspended and winnings revoked.

### Password Restricted Tournaments with a Coupon Code Entry Requirement:

Players may be asked to use a specific coupon code in order to access the Restricted Tournament password and gain entry in to a Restricted Tournament. If a player has not used the coupon code specified and has obtained a password by any other means, this will not constitute a valid entry in to the Restricted Tournament. Players will not be eligible to enter the Tournament nor will they be entitled to any Tournament winnings in the Restricted Tournament if they have not used the required coupon code and obtained the Tournament password as provided by the casino. Any winnings accrued from an invalid entry will be removed from the player's account and the player may have their casino account suspended and winnings revoked.

### LIVE DEALER TERMS

1. Live Dealer gameplay is intended as a premium feature for real money gameplay.
2. If allowed, any freebie (i.e. Free Chips, Loyalty Bonuses, Appreciation Chips, Comp Points, Weekly or Monthly Cashback, etc...) used to play Live Dealer will be used with its original maximum cashout limit and restrictions.
3. If allowed, and unless stated otherwise, any gameplay on Live Dealer games will not contribute towards the completion of any wagering or playthrough requirements.
4. While playing with balance from any bonus, the original rules of the bonus will continue to apply even after the wagering/playthrough requirement of such bonus has been completed. This means it is not allowed to play Live Dealer games with coupons intended for “Slots and Keno only”, or “Blackjack and table games”. Playing Live Dealer with such bonus/coupons will result in the winnings being voided.
5. The Casino and its support team are unable to refund any bets or tips made by mistake or otherwise during Live Dealer gameplay.
6. The Casino is not responsible for availability of seats, dealers nor croupiers.
7. The Casino reserves the right for extra time to review winnings deriving from Live Dealer gameplay.

10. Unless otherwise stated, usual terms and conditions apply.

### Processing Fees and Limitations

1. All withdrawals may incur a processing fee of up to $40, depending on the payment processor and/or withdrawal amount.
2. Due to 3rd party processing limitations or policies, the withdrawal amount paid or processed to players on a weekly or monthly basis may vary.

4. When requesting multiple withdrawals, the Casino reserves the right to combine total withdrawals requested into as few requests as possible to make payments faster, and up to the maximum allowed amount to be paid per week.

### Important Information About Check Payments

1. When you receive a payment by check, you must deposit said check to a financial institution within 30 days of issue. Any delay could result in the check no longer being valid. In this event the company is not responsible, and a reissue of the check payment will not be made.
2. Checks must be deposited to your bank account and not cashed.
3. Checks may not be endorsed to a third party.
4. If any of the above conditions regarding checks are not met, the company will not be held liable; check payments will not be reissued.

### Important Information Regarding Withdrawals Which Require Stop Payments

In certain withdrawal cases (whether due to change of address, lost checks or other unforeseen variables) a stop-payment must be made on Bank Checks that have already been sent so that a new payment can be initiated. If a stop payment must be made (or is requested) the following will take place:

1. Stop Payment will be requested by Casino.
2. Once the Stop Payment has been confirmed by the third-party processing company the withdrawal funds will be re-deposited back into the Player's account.
3. Player will be contacted at the phone number and email address the Casino has on file to inform them about the returned funds.
4. Should an address update/correction be required the Casino will request an updated Utility Bill reflecting the new address where the withdrawal needs to be sent to.
5. The Player will then need to re-request the withdrawal and wait the standard time frame for Bank Check withdrawals.
6. If the Stop Payment was caused by misleading or wrong information provided by the customer, corresponding fees will be charged and deducted from the withdrawal amount.
