COOKIES, OTHER SIMILAR AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES, AND ADVERTISING
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you interact with our online services, or open emails we send you, we obtain certain information using automated technologies, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that may be used in our websites or emails.

We use these automated technologies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and inferences as described above. These technologies help us to:

● Remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it;

● Track and understand how you use and interact with our online services and emails;

● Tailor our online services to your preferences;

● Measure how useful and effective our services and communications are to you; and

● Otherwise manage and enhance our products and services.

We set some of these automated technologies ourselves, but others are set by third parties who deliver services on our behalf. For example, we may use other companies’ web analytics services (described in the “Third-Party Analytics Services” section), which use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers use our websites. Some of these technologies may also be set by third parties that help us advertise our products and services to you as informed by your interests, based on information collected from your activity on the web, including but not limited to, browsing or purchasing products on or through our websites or on third party websites or your activity on mobile sites and applications. This advertising approach is called interest-based advertising or “targeted advertising.” You thus may see certain ads on other websites because we use these third-party services to show you Weebly ads that may be tailored to your individual interests.

### THIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS SERVICES

Our analytics partners help us with our online services, such as Google Analytics, BugSnag, and Crashlytics. The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs to help us analyze how you use our online services.

We keep your information as long as is necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Notice, including to provide you the Services, to comply with applicable law and legal obligations, to defend our legal rights, property, and users. Even after you deactivate your account, we may retain copies of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time consistent with certain criteria, such as applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our General Terms or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.

### Additional Choices for Third-Party Online Behavioral or Interest-Based Advertising Services on Websites (including Mobile Websites)

Some of the advertising platforms that we use to collect information from or about you in order to provide more relevant advertising to you on websites participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To make choices about the use of your information for online behavioral advertising on websites, please visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance Webchoices tool](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://optout.aboutads.info/?c%3D2%26lang%3DEN&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1672968957251435&usg=AOvVaw2-vlrNsQXPO_Yyv306bmuU) . If you opt out of online behavioral advertising using this method, this opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.

Some of the advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of interest-based advertising delivered to each of its member companies. If you would like to opt out of the NAI’s members’ use of information from or about you on websites, please visit the [NAI’s opt-out of interest-based advertising page](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c%3D1&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1672968957251916&usg=AOvVaw3C7aQtQE-j4UvrypHqsT-j) .

The AppChoices application can be downloaded from your mobile device at [www.aboutads.info/appchoices](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1672968957252515&usg=AOvVaw0cpx0PUKTE2mk0tz_pPkSt) or from your device’s app store. If you opt out of online behavioral advertising using this method, this opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.
