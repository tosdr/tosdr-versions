You are solely responsible for any activity on your account and for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password. We are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your account.

* Buyers pay Fiverr in advance to create an order (see [Payment Terms](https://www.fiverr.com/legal-portal/legal-terms/payment-terms-of-service)).

  

* Orders are purchased through the Order button found on a Seller’s Gig page or through a Custom Offer.

  

* For fees and payments please read the [Payment Terms](https://www.fiverr.com/legal-portal/legal-terms/payment-terms-of-service).

  

* Sellers must fulfill their orders, and may not cancel orders on a regular basis or without cause. Cancelling orders will affect Sellers’ reputation and level.

  

* Sellers gain account levels based on their performance metrics. You can read more about it in the Levels section below.

  

* Users may not offer or accept payments using any method other than placing an order through Fiverr.com.

  

* When purchasing a Gig, Buyers are granted all rights for the delivered work, unless otherwise specified by the Seller on their Gig page.

**4\. Sellers**
---------------

###   

### **4.1 Basics**

  

* Sellers create Gigs on Fiverr to allow Buyers to purchase their services.

  

* Sellers may also offer Custom Offers to Buyers in addition to their Gigs.

  

* Each Gig you sell and successfully complete, accredits your account with a revenue equal to 80% of the purchase amount.

  

* Fiverr accredits Sellers once an order is completed. See our "[Orders](#orders)" section below for a definition of a completed order.

  

* For more information about receiving payments, fees and taxes see the [Payment Terms](https://www.fiverr.com/legal-portal/legal-terms/payment-terms-of-service).

  

* Sellers may not promote their Gigs or any Fiverr content via the Google Ads platform.

  

* The Seller's rating is calculated based on the order reviews posted by Buyers or Pro Account Team Members (for Fiverr Pro). High ratings allow Sellers to obtain advanced Seller levels. In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the suspension of the Seller’s account (see Levels section below).

  

* Sellers are responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts that are sufficient to cover all risks associated with the performance of their services.

  

* If you declare yourself to sell on Fiverr for purposes relating to your primary job or profession, you will be considered as a "Business Seller" and the following additional term will apply to you: (i) upon creating a Gig, or upon our request, Business Sellers, will be required to submit the following information and documents to Fiverr: (a) name, address, telephone number and email address; (b) copy of an identification document (e.g. identity card, passport) or other electronic identification as may be required by us; (c) payment details; (d) trade registration number or equivalent means of identification and the trade register in which the Business Seller is registered (if applicable); (e) self certification by the Business Seller committing to only offer products or services that comply with the European Union applicable regulations; and (f) upon our request, further appropriate documents that prove the information provided. (ii) If a Business Seller fails to provide this information and documents within a given reasonable deadline, Fiverr may restrict or suspend the account.

  

### **4.2 Gigs®**

  

* Sellers are allowed to post a select amount of active Gigs based on their level status, as further detailed [here](https://help.fiverr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010560118-Achieving-levels).

  

* Gigs created on Fiverr are [User Generated Content.](https://fr.fiverr.com/legal-portal/legal-terms/terms-of-service#1)

  

* Gigs and/or users may be removed by Fiverr from the Site for violations of the Terms, which may include (but are not limited to) the following violations and/or materials:

  

* Illegal or fraudulent services

  

* Copyright Infringement, Trademark Infringement, and violation of a third party's terms of service reported through our Intellectual Property Claims Policy found [here](https://www.fiverr.com/intellectual-property)

* Promoting Fiverr and/or Fiverr Gigs through activities that are prohibited by any laws, regulations, and/or third parties' terms of service, as well as through any marketing activity that negatively affects our relationships with our users or partners.

  

* Gigs that are removed for violations mentioned above, may result in the suspension of the Seller’s account.

  

* Gigs that have been permanently removed for violations are not eligible to be restored or edited.

  

* Gigs may be removed from our listings due to violations of our Terms, poor performance and/or user misconduct.

  

* Gigs may include website URLs to pre-approved URL-patterns contained within the Gig description and requirements box. Gigs containing websites promoting content, which violates Fiverr’s Terms, will be removed.

  

* Gigs are required to have an appropriate Gig image related to the service offered. Sellers must deliver the same quality of service as shown on their Gig images. Recurring deliveries that don’t match the quality shown on the Gig images may lead to the Seller’s account losing Seller status or becoming permanently disabled.

  

* Gigs may contain an approved Gig Video uploaded through the Gig management tools available on Fiverr, as further described [here](https://help.fiverr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010451657-Adding-a-Video-to-your-Gig).

  

* Statements on the Gig Page that undermine or circumvent these Terms are prohibited.

**7\. Fiverr Logo Maker**

Fiverr Logo Maker allows certain Sellers to offer various original logo designs (each, a “**Logo Design**”) for Buyers to adjust and customize per their own specific needs, using special automated design tools. Through the Logo Maker, Buyers purchase full commercial use license (as further detailed below) to the Logo Design embedded with their brand name.

  

Fiverr Logo Maker Sellers are chosen manually by Fiverr editors through an ongoing review process based on quality of designs, seniority, volume of sales, high ratings, exceptional customer care, high order completion rate and more. We may use automated systems that analyze Sellers uploaded Logo Design to help detect and prevent infringement or other illegal content, as well as limit the number of active Logo Designs each Seller can offer.

  

By uploading a Logo Design to Fiverr Logo Maker you represent and warrant that it is your original work, you exclusively own all rights to such design, and it does not infringe any third party rights. You further warrant that such design was never sold before to anyone and that you will not offer it for sale outside of Fiverr Logo Maker.

  

### **7.1 Editing Tool Commercial Use License**

Please note that reselling the Logo Design and/or Logo Design variations is forbidden and may result in restrictions to your account. Fiverr reserves the right to provide you with generally available updates to the editing tool and/or terminate the service at its sole discretion.

  

### **7.2 Logo Design Commercial Use License**

  

When an order through the Logo Maker is completed, and subject to payment, the Seller grants the Buyer a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use the Logo Design embedded with the Buyer’s brand name for any purpose, except for any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose. There is no warranty, express or implied, with the grant of this license, including with respect to fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the Seller nor Fiverr will be liable for any claims, or incidental, consequential or other damages arising out of this license, the Logo Design or the Buyers use of the Logo Design. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller retains all ownership rights to the Logo Design, and no ownership or copyrights are granted to the Buyer.

By uploading to, or creating content on, the Site, you represent and warrant that you own or have obtained all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority, necessary to use and/or upload such content and that such content or the use thereof in the Site does not and shall not (a) infringe or violate any intellectual property, proprietary or privacy, data protection or publicity rights of any third party; (b) violate any applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions; and/or (c) violate any of your or third party’s policies and/or terms of service. We invite everyone to report violations together with proof of ownership as appropriate. Violating content may be removed or disabled. To learn more on our reporting tools, see [here](https://help.fiverr.com/hc/en-us/articles/9596156809105-How-to-report-content-or-behavior-on-Fiverr).

  

Furthermore, Fiverr is not responsible for the content, quality or the level of service provided by the Sellers (even if they are Pro Freelancers, Top Rated Sellers, offer Promoted Gigs or otherwise). We provide no warranty with respect to the Gigs, their delivery, any communications between Buyers and Sellers, and the Logo Designs created through the Logo Maker. We encourage users to take advantage of our rating system, our community and common sense in choosing appropriate services.

  

By offering a service, the Seller undertakes that they have sufficient permissions, rights and/or licenses to provide, sell or resell the service that is offered on Fiverr. Sellers advertising online their Gig or Logo Design created through the Logo Maker must comply with laws and terms of service of the advertising platform or relevant website used to advertise. Failing to do so may result in removal of the Gig or Logo Design from the Logo Maker, as applicable, and may lead to the suspension of Seller's account.

  

For specific terms related to Intellectual Property rights and for reporting claims of copyright infringement (DMCA notices) or trademark infringement - please see our [Intellectual Property Claims Policy](https://www.fiverr.com/legal-portal/community/intellectual-property) which forms an integral part of the Terms. Note that it is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.

  

**10\. Ownership**
------------------

  

Ownership and limitations: When purchasing a Gig on Fiverr, unless clearly stated otherwise on the Seller's Gig page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, copyright in the work delivered from the Seller, and the Seller waives any and all moral rights (to the extent permitted by applicable law) therein. Accordingly, the Seller expressly assigns to the Buyer the copyright in the delivered work. All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to the Buyer shall be subject to full payment for the Gig, and the delivery may not be used if payment is cancelled for any reason. For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as art work, design work, report generation etc.), the delivered work and its copyright shall be the exclusive property of the Buyer and, upon delivery, the Seller agrees that it thereby, pursuant to the Terms, assigns all right, title and interest in and to the delivered work to the Buyer. Some Gigs (including for custom created work) charge additional payments (through Gig Extras) for a Commercial Use License. This means that if you purchase the Gig for personal use, you will own all rights you require for such use, and will not need the Commercial Use License. If you intend to use it for any charge or other consideration, or for any purpose that is directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit, you will need to buy the Commercial Use License through a Gig Extra and will have broader rights that cover your business use.

  

For Voice Over Gigs, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is purchasing basic rights (which means the Buyer is paying a one time fee allowing them to use the work forever and for non-commercial purposes). If you intend to use the Voice Over to promote a product and/or service (with the exception of paid marketing channels), you will need to purchase the Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) through Gig Extra. If you intend to use the Voice Over in radio, television and internet commercials, you will need to purchase the Full Broadcast Rights (Buy-Out) through Gig Extra. For further information on the type of buy-outs, please read below.

  

Furthermore, users (both Buyers and Sellers) agree that unless they explicitly indicate otherwise, the content users voluntarily create/upload to Fiverr, including Gig texts, photos, videos, usernames, user photos, user videos and any other information, including the display of delivered work, may be used by Fiverr for no consideration for marketing purposes and/or other purposes relevant for the operation and function of the Site.

  

### **10.1 Voice Over Commercial Buy-Out**

  

When purchasing a Voice Over Gig, the Seller grants you a non-commercial perpetual, exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the purchased Voice Over. This excludes any commercial use, including radio, television and internet commercial spots.

  

By purchasing a Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) with your order, in addition to the basic rights, the Seller grants you with a license to use the Voice Over for any commercial, promotional and non-broadcast purposes for such period agreed with the Seller (and unless agreed otherwise - in perpetuity). Commercial, promotional and non-broadcast purposes means any business related use for the creation of, or to promote a for-profit product or service (with the exception of paid marketing channels), such as (by way of example): explainer videos posted to company websites, social networks or email campaigns, audiobooks, podcast intros, and strictly excludes any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose.

  

By purchasing a Full Broadcast Rights (Buy-Out) with your order, in addition to the Commercial Rights, the Seller grants you with a license for full broadcasting for such period agreed with the Seller (and unless agreed otherwise - in perpetuity). Full Broadcasting includes internet, radio, and TV "paid channels", such as (by way of example), television commercials, radio commercials, internet radio, and music/video streaming platforms, and strictly excludes any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose.

  

This Buy-Out is subject to Fiverr's Terms. There is no warranty, express or implied, with the purchase of this delivery, including with respect to fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the Seller nor Fiverr will be liable for any claims, or incidental, consequential or other damages arising out of this license, the delivery or your use of the delivery.

  

### **10.2 Gig Commercial Use License**

  

By purchasing a “Commercial Use License” with your Gig Order, the Seller grants you a perpetual, exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the purchased delivery for Permitted Commercial Purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller retains all ownership rights. “Permitted Commercial Purposes” means any business related use, such as (by way of example) advertising, promotion, creating web pages, integration into product, software or other business related tools etc., and strictly excludes any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose. This License is subject to Fiverr’s Terms. There is no warranty, express or implied, with the purchase of this delivery, including with respect to fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the Seller nor Fiverr will be liable for any claims, or incidental, consequential or other damages arising out of this license, the delivery or your use of the delivery.
