Return Policy
=============

#### 30-day Return Policy

We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.

Custom hammers are given the same guarantee, but are subject to the cost of an installed grip. Once a grip is installed, it must be destroyed in order to be removed. Exchanges and/or returns will be liable for this item. It’s recommended that you order a hammer ‘unassembled’ if you are not certain on the parts best suited to your needs.

You can always [contact us](https://martineztools.com/pages/contact "Contact Us") for any return questions.

#### To start a return request:

1. Fill out and submit our Warranty & Return Request Form. Your request will be evaluated by our customer service manager and will be assigned a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.
2. After that we will be in touch with you about approval of your request, handling the shipment of any returned tool, and any other issues related to your warranty request.
3. Be sure to include your RMA # on all correspondence.

If your return is accepted, we’ll send you instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted. Please note that if your country of residence is not the United States, shipping your goods may take longer than expected.

### Other Claims & Returns

#### Damages and issues

Please inspect your order upon receipt and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so that we may evaluate the issue and make it right.

Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods or custom products (such as special orders or personalized items). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.

Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.

#### Refunds and exchanges

Martinez Tools offers a **30 day money back guarantee** for our standard hammers, in like new condition. In the event you need to return or exchange an item, please fill in the [Warranty & Return form](https://martineztools.com/pages/warranty-return-form "Warranty & Return Form"). You will be issued a Return Merchandise Authorization Number (RMA) and get instructions on how to return this hammer. This guarantee does not include any shipping cost.

Custom hammers are given the same guarantee, but are subject to the cost of an installed grip. Once a grip is installed, it must be destroyed in order to be removed. Exchanges and/or returns will be liable for this item if it has been installed. It’s recommended that you order a custom hammer ‘unassembled’ if you are not certain as to the exact specifications you will need. This way if only one part of this hammer is incorrect, only that one item will need to be exchanged. Last but not least, if you need any help in selecting the perfect hammer, we are here to help.
