Terms and Conditions
====================

#### 1\. Scope

All deliveries and services of skatedeluxe GmbH (hereafter skatedeluxe) through the online shop on the domain skatedeluxe.ch are undertaken exclusively on the basis of the general terms and conditions at the time of the particular order. They apply for all business transactions and deliveries within Switzerland. Skatedeluxe acknowledges conflicting conditions only if we have expressly acknowledged them in writing.

#### 2\. Contract Conclusion, Contract Language, and Contract Text Records

The sales contract becomes effective upon the shipment of the order. Contract conclusion can be effected in English. All prices shown include the value-added tax and other price components and are therefore to be understood as final prices.

#### 3\. Customer Account

Only one customer account is allowed per natural person in our online shop. We reserve the right to block and/or delete your customer account in the event that we detect multiple registrations or if our security system identifies your account as being unusual or fraudulent.

Our offer is directed solely to direct end consumers. Purchasing products for resale is strictly prohibited. If we suspect you intend to purchase products in order to resell them, we reserve the right to refuse orders, cancel orders and/or block and delete your customer account.

#### 4\. Delivery and Shipping Costs

You will receive your order in one single package if possible. We reserve the right to partially deliver your order if there are bulky products or if a product will be available at a later time. This is no disadvantage for you since we pay for the additional shipping costs. Find all information about shipping costs for your delivery here: [Shipping costs](https://www.skatedeluxe.ch/en/i/customer-service/shipping)

#### 5\. Payment Options

You can choose from different payment methods: PayPal, credit card, GooglePay, ApplePay, pay in advance (bank transfer) and Sofort (Klarna). We reserve the right to exclude certain payment methods. If you choose to pay in advance you will receive our bank information together with the order confirmation. The money transfer is to be made to the indicated account within 10 days. More information about payment: [Payment](https://www.skatedeluxe.ch/en/i/customer-service/payment)

#### 6\. Falsities

We consider obvious errors, translation errors, mistakes in writing, misprints or calculation errors occurring while offering products or processing orders to be non-binding.

#### 7\. Return policy

We grant you a voluntary right to return any merchandise within 30 days under the following conditions:

You may cancel the contract by returning the merchandise within 30 days after receipt. Punctual dispatch suffices to comply with the time limit. To exercise the right to return, it is required that the whole and undamaged merchandise has only been tried on, as it would be in a retail store. We ask you to return the merchandise in its original wrapping using the free return label that we add to each package.

We will cover the cost of returning the goods if you use the return documents provided by us. If you do not have a prepaid return label, please contact our [customer service.](https://www.skatedeluxe.ch/en/i/contact)

You will receive the return documents after registering your return online. [More info on returns.](https://www.skatedeluxe.ch/en/i/customer-service/return)

**Consequences of return**: In case of a correct exercise of the right of cancellation we refund payments already made (except shipping costs) within 10 days after receipt of the merchandise.

**Exclusion of return policy**  
The right to return does not apply to contracts:

* if the delivered goods are newspapers, periodicals or magazines with the exception of subscription contracts,
* if the goods are not prefabricated and whose production is based on individual selection or provision by the consumer, or if the goods are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer,
* if the products delivered are sealed goods that are not suitable for return for reasons of health or hygiene, if their seal has been removed after delivery,
* if after their delivery, the goods were inseparably mixed with other goods due to the nature of the products.

#### 8\. Reservation of title

The delivered goods remain our property until full payment of the purchase price has been received.

#### 9\. Right to reserve contract acceptance

We reserve the right to refuse to accept your order. This is especially applicable to the following cases:

* The product is not available;
* Your payment information is not correct or verifiable;
* Your order or customer account is flagged by our security system as being unusual or fraudulent;
* You are a reseller;
* The displayed price in our online shop was incorrect;
* We are unable to deliver to the address provided;
* We are unable to provide service due to events that are out of our control.

#### 10\. Liability

For negligent breaches of the contract's main obligations, our liability is limited to average foreseeable and direct losses that are typical both for the contract and the nature of the goods. This limited liability also applies to negligent breaches of duty caused by our legal representatives or auxiliary staff.  
Incidentally, we are liable according to legal regulations if the contractual partner asserts compensation claims for damages or losses which are the result of intent or gross negligence, including the result of intent or gross negligence caused by our legal representatives or auxiliary staff. If we are not charged with grossly negligent or intentional breaches of duty, our liability is limited to average foreseeable damages which might be typical for these circumstances.  
The above limitations of liability do not apply when damages or losses are caused by injury to life, body or health.

#### 11\. Warranty

In the case of defects in delivered goods, statutory rights apply.

#### 12\. Data storage

We would like to point out that entered data is processed and stored using electronic data processing equipment. Personal data is kept confidential and used for business purposes only. More information is available here on our website: [Data protection](https://www.skatedeluxe.ch/en/i/privacy)

#### 13\. Applicable law

These general terms and conditions are subject to Swiss law. For all disputes resulting from or associated with these terms and conditions, the closest court to the consumer's residence is exclusively responsible.
