4\. Security Measures to Protect Your Personal Data
---------------------------------------------------

We take all reasonable technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data from loss, misuse or unauthorised alteration. All personal data you provide is stored in encrypted databases on secure and firewall-protected servers located in world-class UK data centres. When you submit personal information through online forms on our website (such as registration or order forms), the data is encrypted using SSL/TLS technology to ensure secure communication between your browser and our servers.

For payment transactions on [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/), we use Braintree to process application fees and manage refunds. Braintree securely handles debit or credit card payments and integrates PayPal, Google Pay and Apple Pay. Your payment details are always secure, and we do not store your credit or debit card information.

The CitizenCard site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third-party websites you may visit once you have left our website.

### International Transfers of Your Personal Data

Some of the third-party service providers we use may process your personal data outside the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA). When this occurs, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in line with UK GDPR requirements.

* Braintree (a PayPal service) may process payment information outside the UK or EEA, particularly in the United States. Data transfers are safeguarded by PayPal's adherence to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission.
* Google Cloud Vision API and Google Analytics may process data outside the UK or EEA. Google protects international transfers using Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and has been certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.
* SurveyMonkey may transfer personal data outside of the UK and EEA to countries like the United States, where their servers are located. However, they have mechanisms in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to ensure that your personal data remains protected and that international transfers comply with applicable data protection laws.

Where data is transferred internationally, we take steps to ensure that it is processed securely, and we only work with providers who can demonstrate their commitment to safeguarding your data.

5\. Use of Cookies and Web Analytics Services
---------------------------------------------

### Cookies

Cookies are essential to the proper functioning of this site and enhance your experience by storing certain information during your visits. By using the CitizenCard site and any linked subdomains on **citizencard.com**, you agree to the use of 'Necessary' cookies, which are essential for the functioning of the site and cannot be disabled. You have the ability to manage your cookie preferences through our cookie banner. If you wish to disable cookies, further details are provided below on how to do so. However, please note that certain features, such as the online CitizenCard application process, may not function correctly if cookies are disabled.

Cookies are small text files placed on your device by websites you visit, including **citizencard.com** and its subdomains such as **support.citizencard.com**, **online.citizencard.com** and **verify.citizencard.com**. These files are linked to your device, not directly to you, and do not store any personal data unless you explicitly provide it.

Under EU and UK GDPR regulations, we ensure compliance with the law regarding the use of cookies on **citizencard.com** and its subdomains. Cookies serve various functions, such as remembering your preferences and improving your user experience. We use both **session cookies** (which are deleted when you close your browser) and **persistent cookies** (which remain on your device until deleted or until they expire).

We use Local Storage in addition to cookies to store specific information necessary for the functioning of our payment services. For example, items like '\_\_paypal\_storage\_\_' are stored to facilitate transactions with PayPal and ensure a secure checkout process on [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/). Unlike cookies, Local Storage data persists across browser sessions unless manually cleared, helping to maintain a smooth and secure payment experience.

Google Analytics helps us measure metrics such as page visits, traffic sources and site performance. Additionally, we may track registered users across devices and sessions using Google Analytics User-ID feature on [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/) to provide a more accurate analysis of customer interactions. Google Consent Mode ensures that these cookies are only set if you provide consent.

### How to Manage and Turn Off Cookies

You can manage your cookie preferences using our cookie banner that appears when you visit our site. If you clear your cookies or access our site from a new browser or device, the cookie banner will reappear. Additionally, you can disable cookies entirely through your browser settings. For detailed instructions, visit [allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org/) or consult your browser's 'Help' section. Please note that disabling cookies might impair your experience on the site.

Our cookie banner also respects the 'Do Not Track' (DNT) setting of your browser. If DNT is enabled, our banner will prevent the placement of any tracking cookies, even if you have previously given consent to cookies on this site.

### Web Analytics Services

We use Google Analytics to better understand how visitors engage with **citizencard.com** and its subdomains. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyse site traffic and usage patterns, which in turn helps us improve your experience. Additionally, we may track registered users across devices and sessions using Google Analytics User-ID feature on [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/) which provides a more accurate analysis of customer interactions.

Google Analytics includes machine learning algorithms that generate automated insights about user behaviour and preferences. This can involve complex data processing, such as predicting trends, segmenting audiences, and identifying patterns that help us tailor our services and content. Machine learning in Google Analytics analyses data points automatically, offering insights without requiring human intervention. While this aids in improving our services, we understand the complexity of such processes, and we are committed to transparency.

Google Consent Mode (GCM) ensures that no 'Analytics' cookies are set until you provide consent. This respects your privacy choices by dynamically adjusting how Google Analytics operates based on your preferences.

For details on how Google's third-party cookies handle your data, see the [Google Privacy Policy](https://business.safety.google/privacy/).

If you prefer not to have your data tracked by Google Analytics, you can opt out by adjusting your preferences in the cookie banner or by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

The AWIN cookies may collect data like:

* pages you visit on our site
* purchases you make, including reference numbers
* IP address, device information, and browser type
* referring URLs and timestamps.

This data is used by AWIN to:

* track the effectiveness of affiliate links

6\. Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal data
-------------------------------------------------

With respect to personal data collected from individuals resident in the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. CitizenCard will normally collect personal data from you only where:

* we have your consent to do so
* we need the personal data to deliver the services you have requested (e.g., process your application for a CitizenCard Proof of Age and ID card)
* the processing is in our legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms), such as improving website functionality, analytics, and user experience (where consent is required, such as for Analytics, we will obtain it).

* * *

7\. Limiting Use, Disclosure, Retention
---------------------------------------

CitizenCard identifies the purposes for which the information is being collected before or at the time of collection. The collection of your personal data will be limited to that which is needed for the purposes identified by our company. Unless you consent or we are required by law, we will only use the personal data for the purposes for which it was collected. If CitizenCard will be processing your personal data for another purpose later on, we will seek your further legal permission or consent; except where the other purpose is compatible with the original purpose. We will keep your personal data only as long as required to serve those purposes.

### Retention of Personal Data

We take data retention seriously and ensure that we retain personal data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable law. After the retention period has expired, we securely delete or anonymise personal data.

The following outlines the retention periods for different types of records:

1\. Paper Records

Paper records are retained for the following maximum periods, after which they are securely shredded:

* Successful and failed applicant records:  
    Retained for 3 months after an application has been received.
* Pending applicant records:  
    Retained for 12 months after the initial application has been received.
* Verifier registration records for Bulk scheme (available only to schools, universities, councils, prisons and charities):  
    Retained for 12 months after registration has been completed.

2\. Digital records

Digital records are retained for varying periods depending on the type of data. The following outlines these retention periods:

* Customer and applicant records (including referees' data and technical data such as IP address, browser details, device information):  
    Personal data related to customers and their digital applications is retained for 20 years following record creation. This allows us to facilitate replacement card applications without the need for re-verification, to enable customers to continue pending applications, and to verify the validity of cards through our verification services such as [verify.citizencard.com](https://verify.citizencard.com/) and the PASS Card Verify app. After 20 years, the data is moved to a Secure Archive with restricted access, where it may be retained for an extended period to cooperate with law enforcement agencies if necessary.
* Electronic communications (e.g., emails, Support Centre tickets, and any attachments):  
    Communications, including emails or Support Centre messages exchanged with applicants or referees, are retained for 10 years following the most recent contact. After this period, these communications are securely deleted.
* Photos of cards processed via the PASS Card Verify mobile app:  
    Photos are stored for 30 days after image creation and are automatically deleted thereafter.
* Card verification web-pages:  
    Verification pages created through [verify.citizencard.com](https://verify.citizencard.com/) are retained for 2 minutes after page creation, after which they are automatically deleted.
* Card Verification results:  
    Results from card verification checks, whether conducted via our secure API, on [verify.citizencard.com](https://verify.citizencard.com/), or through the PASS Card Verify app, are retained for 30 days following a check. After this period, all personal data associated with the verification is anonymised, meaning all identifying information is permanently removed.
* Yoti Identity Verification (our Electronic ID Validation Technology supplier):  
    For applicants using Yoti's electronic Identity Verification service, data is retained for 28 days following the completion of the verification session. After this period, the data is securely deleted.
* Royal Mail:  
    Data used by Royal Mail for delivery purposes is retained for only as long as required to provide the service, after which it is deleted.
* Survey Data:  
    Any survey responses or customer feedback used to improve our services and offerings (such as through SimpleSavings Offers or other product-related feedback) will be retained for a maximum of 1 year from the date of collection. After this period, the data will be deleted or anonymised.
* AWIN Advertiser:  
    AWIN affiliate tracking data related to referrals and commissions for customers using referral links will be retained for up to 3 years to ensure proper commission tracking and attribution. After this period, data is anonymised or deleted.
* Analytics data:  
    Technical data, including IP addresses, browser details, and device information collected via analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), is retained for up to 14 months. This includes all data, such as registered users tracked across devices via the Google Analytics User-ID feature. After this period, the data is either anonymised or deleted.
* Payment Transaction data:  
    Payment information processed through Braintree (a PayPal service), our secure payment provider, is retained in accordance with the provider's policies. This data is kept only for as long as necessary to fulfil the transaction and comply with legal obligations.
* Phone Recordings:  
    Recordings of customer service calls (where consented) are retained for 3 months after the call, after which they are automatically deleted.
* Web server logs:  
    Logs generated from web server activity, including applicant and referee data, are retained for 14 days after creation. These logs are used to monitor website security, analyse performance, detect and prevent fraudulent activity, and troubleshoot technical issues.
