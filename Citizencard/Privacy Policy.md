5\. Our Use of Cookies and Web Analytics Services
-------------------------------------------------

### Cookies

Cookies are necessary for the full functioning of this site. By using the CitizenCard site and any linked sub-domains/sites on _**citizencard.com**_, you are providing implied consent to the use of cookies on this site in accordance with the terms of this policy. You can disable cookies (further information below), but if you do, you may find that parts of the site will not function correctly for you and we may not be able to complete requests on your behalf such as the **online CitizenCard application process**. If you do not consent to the use of cookies and wish to disable cookies resulting in impaired website functionality, you should discontinue use of the site.

Cookies are small text data files that some websites place on your computer or other device when you visit them. They're used by many if not the majority of modern websites, including by informational, membership and commercial sites like _**citizencard.com**_ and related subdomains such as _**support.citizencard.com**_, _**online.citizencard.com**_ and _**verify.citizencard.com**_. Cookies are linked to the machine you use to visit our site and not to you as an individual so they are not 'personal' in that sense. Unless you login or provide personal data through your use of this website, no personal information is collected.

Cookies are commonly used by websites to remember some aspect of your current or previous visit. This could include things like the choices you've made or preferences you've chosen during your visit. Websites commonly do this in order to improve or tailor your current and future visits to that site or other related sites.

Cookies on _**citizencard.com**_ and its subdomains are also necessary for the correct functioning of some aspects of the site such as the application process for an identity card, and retaining information to ensure that discount codes or referral commission you may have earned through recommending CitizenCard ID to your friends, can be collected and discounts, or commission, correctly assigned to you (where relevant). We may use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the site. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

The information stored in a cookie can only be read by the website that placed the cookie or other sites that it has agreed to share information with.

At CitizenCard Ltd, we are committed to protecting your privacy and security to ensuring that we meet all regulations. Our policy is to use cookies only to improve your user experience and the way we do business with you, and when they are essential to the practical and technical functioning of the website(s).

We may use cookies to:

* store details that help you apply for and manage your CitizenCard online which are strictly necessary to the process
* store details that enable us to apply discounts and commission to you
* store details that help you to contact us via our Support Centre
* ensure that you can redeem an Offer in the SimpleSavings scheme
* find out how people use our sites, such as how often they visit, which web browsers and screen resolution they use, which pages they go to, and which links they click on, so that we can improve our sites. For this purpose, we use Google Analytics to provide insight on user visits patterns (such as the most popular pages, or most searched for terms), and cookies stored on your computer will contribute to that data which is collated from all visitors (with cookies enabled).

We do not currently use cookies to serve you any targeted advertising on citizencard.com. Were we to do so at some future point, the privacy and cookie policy would be updated to reflect this and you would have the option to opt out by disabling cookies or discontinuing site use in full or in part as you do now.

6\. Legal Basis for Processing your Personal data
-------------------------------------------------

With respect to personal data collected from individuals resident in the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. CitizenCard will normally collect personal data from you only where:

* we have your consent to do so
* where we need the personal data to deliver the services you have requested (e.g. process your application for a CitizenCard Proof of Age and ID card)
* where the processing is in our legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).

* * *

7\. Limiting Use, Disclosure, Retention
---------------------------------------

CitizenCard identifies the purposes for which the information is being collected before or at the time of collection. The collection of your personal data will be limited to that which is needed for the purposes identified by our company. Unless you consent or we are required by law, we will only use the personal data for the purposes for which it was collected. If CitizenCard will be processing your personal data for another purpose later on, we will seek your further legal permission or consent; except where the other purpose is compatible with the original purpose. We will keep your personal data only as long as required to serve those purposes.

Paper records are retained for the following maximum periods after which time they are shredded:

* Successful and failed applicant records – 3 months after an application has been received
* Pending applicant records – 12 months after the initial application has been received.

Digital records are retained for:

* Customers and their digital applications containing applicant's personal data and their referees - 20 years after record creation so customers can apply for replacement cards without being re-verified, applicants can continue pending applications and we can verify cards as valid either at [verify.citizencard.com](https://verify.citizencard.com/) or when the PASS Card Verify app is used; after 20 years the data is moved to a Secure Archive with restricted access so we can collaborate with law enforcement agencies when necessary
* Electronic communications such as emails - 10 years following the most recent contact made by an applicant or a referee after which the data is deleted
* Photos of cards processed by the PASS Card Verify mobile app - 90 days following image creation after which the data is deleted
* Card verification web-page for a card check made at [verify.citizencard.com](https://verify.citizencard.com/) - 2 minutes following page creation after which the page is deleted
* Card Verification results for checks made at [verify.citizencard.com](https://verify.citizencard.com/) and via the PASS Card Verify app - 5 years following a check after which the data is anonymised (all personal information removed)
* Yoti Identity Verification, our Electronic ID Validation Technology supplier, retains the data for 28 days following the completion of the Identity Verification session
* Royal Mail, our delivery provider, retains the data only for as long as they need to use it to provide the service requested.

* * *

8\. Your Access to and Updating of your Personal data
-----------------------------------------------------

Reasonable access to your personal data may be provided upon request made to CitizenCard via email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.citizencard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If access cannot be provided within that time frame, CitizenCard will provide the requesting party a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, we will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.

If you are a CitizenCard cardholder, you can update your information e.g. address or contact details and we encourage you to do so on [Update Your Personal Details page](https://www.citizencard.com/update-your-personal-details).

If you would like us to delete any personal data held about you, we will do so on request unless we need to hold the information as part of the provision of products and services to you. Data removal requests should be sent (include your name and CitizenCard card number) via email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.citizencard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

10\. Additional Rights
----------------------

You may have the right to exercise additional rights available to you under UK applicable laws, including:

### Right of erasure

You may have a broader right to erasure of personal data that we hold about you. For example, if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes or to comply with our legal obligations.

### Right to object to processing

You may have the right to request that we stop processing your personal data and/or to stop sending you marketing communications.

### Right to restrict processing

You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. For example, where you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or unlawfully held.

### Right to data portability

In certain circumstances, you may have the right to be provided with your personal data in a structured, machine readable and commonly used format and to request that we transfer the personal data to another data controller without hindrance.

If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please contact our support team via email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.citizencard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request.
