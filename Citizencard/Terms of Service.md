5\. APPLICANT'S OBLIGATIONS
---------------------------

5.1 The Applicant must consent on the Application Form that he or she acknowledges that payment to The Company covers the cost of the Card Application Processing and Validation Service. The Applicant is not paying for the Card which at all times remains the legal property of The Company.

5.2 The Applicant must consent on the Application Form that he or she acknowledges that providing false information is a criminal offence under the terms of the Fraud Act 2006. Provision of false information includes falsifying any of the Applicant's or Referee's personal details, signatures, 'Digital Referee Declarations' and/or countersignatures of (or electronic 'Statements of Truth' confirming the validity of) the Applicant Photo and/or Application Form and/or copy of the Applicant's original Supporting Document.

5.3 Falsifying original Supporting Documents, for example using software such as PhotoShop®, to doctor a government-issued document such as an original or certified copy of a birth certificate, passport or any other government-issued ID is a serious criminal offence and The Company will always refer evidence of such to the Metropolitan Police Amberhill Fraud team.

5.4 The Applicant must complete all parts of the Postal Application Form correctly, complying fully with the requirements set out, including provision of a countersigned Application, countersigned photograph, if applicable countersigned Supporting Document, together with the correct payment. All the tickboxes within the Applicant Declaration must be ticked if the Application is to be successful.

5.5 If an online application is made via [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/) (an eApplication) the Applicant is responsible for ensuring that their Referee submits a 'Digital Referee Declaration Form' and for ensuring that their Referee provides CitizenCard with an electronic 'Statement of Truth' confirming the validity of the application, in particular that the photo supplied is a true likeness to the applicant, and that the applicant's details match those on the applicant's Supporting Document or they have confirmed the applicant's details against the official records held at their workplace. A Referee is not needed if the eApplication is made via the Applicant's original photo ID using the e-IDVT process.

5.6 The Applicant must take the Application form, together with two (2) photographs and if appropriate a copy of their original Supporting Document together with the original Supporting Document to a person qualified, able and willing to act, as a Referee. However, if the application is made via [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/) (an eApplication) using the Applicant's Supporting Document, the applicant must take the original Supporting Document to a person qualified, able and willing to act, as a Referee. A Referee is not needed if the eApplication is made via the Applicant's original photo ID using the e-IDVT process.

5.7 If you apply online, the Card age-band is automatically selected and determined by your date of birth. If you require a higher age-band, you must select it in the "Age-Band" section of the online application page. Failure to do this will result in a current age band card being issued.

5.8 If you apply using one of our Postal Application forms and require an 18+ card but you are still 17 years old when you apply you must attach a letter to your application requesting what age band you would like i.e. 18+ or 16-17. The same applies if you are 15 but want a 16-17 card. Failure to do this will result in a lower age band card being issued. This also depends on form type.

5.9 You can choose the next age-band if the age-band on your card will change within 3 months of your application. Your application will be put on hold until you are eligible to receive the requested age-band.

5.10 The next age-band 16-17 or 18+ CitizenCard cannot be posted until one working day before your birthday; this is subject to your application being verified. If your birthday is on a Sunday your card will not be issued until the first working day after your birthday. If your birthday is on a Monday your card will be posted on the day of your birthday. The application process begins once your application is received at our office.

7.4 For an eApplication made at [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/) the process begins once the application has been submitted and paid for, but please bear in mind that we still need to receive applicant photograph, e-IDVT (Electronic ID Validation Technology) report including uploaded photo ID document plus liveness check or Digital Referee Declaration and Referee's Statement of Truth (confirming applicant's photo as a true likeness and either that applicants details match those on the original Supporting Document or that the details match those held on the Official Records).

7.5 For an application received via the Yoti App, the process begins once the application has been submitted and paid for. If the photo or ID image (of the passport, driving licence or EU national identity card) supplied to us by Yoti is not compliant you will need to send us an acceptable photo or copy of your ID.

7.6 The normal cost of the standard application process is £18 (including VAT at the prevailing rate). The normal cost of the urgent application process is £35 (including VAT at the prevailing rate). The normal cost of the standard replacement application process is £14 (including VAT at the prevailing rate). The normal cost of the urgent replacement application process is £29 (including VAT at the prevailing rate). Promotional or discounted rates may be offered from time to time.

7.7 The applicant, or if the applicant is below the age of sixteen (16) their parent or legal guardian, is responsible for making payment in full at the time of applying. Payment covers the cost of the Application Processing and Validation Service, not the Card itself which if issued remains at all times the legal property of The Company.

7.8 If full payment is not received the application will not be processed. Payment can be made by postal order, credit or debit Card. Cash cannot be accepted in payment unless the Applicant attends the London office of CitizenCard in person having made a prior appointment.

9.2 For eApplications made at [online.citizencard.com](https://online.citizencard.com/) the Applicant must upload one passport-quality photo, the likeness of which to the Applicant must be confirmed by the e-IDVT (Electronic ID Validation Technology) process or the Referee in their 'Statement of Truth'.

9.7 Applications received without the two (2) photographs enclosed in the format required will be rejected.

10\. USE OF CARD
----------------

10.1 Although We may issue You with a Card it remains at all times Our legal property. It may only be used by the lawful holder of the Card who is the Applicant. The Card may not be lent, sold or given to any other person under any circumstances.

10.2 The Card may only be used, by the lawful holder, for the purpose of proving identity or age in order to access goods or services where the provider of such goods or services requires evidence of the customer's identity and/or age.

10.3 The Card contains a PASS hologram which means that it is endorsed as a valid form of ID and proof of age by the government and the police. All national retail trade associations (together representing most of the shops, supermarkets, pubs and clubs in the UK) and all airlines recognise the card as valid ID (for domestic flights) and proof of age.

However, no guarantee can be given that a particular premise, or individual working at that premise, will acknowledge and/or accept the Card as valid ID or proof of age.

10.4 The Company is in no way liable for non-acceptance of a Card under any circumstances. A lawful holder of a Card must therefore satisfy themselves that a premise at which they intend to use their Card will acknowledge and accept the Card as valid ID and proof of age.

10.5 Under no circumstances will The Company entertain requests for refunded payments in instances where a Card is refused. Payments to CitizenCard are made to cover the cost of the Application Processing and Validation Service, not for the Card itself which remains at all times the legal property of The Company.

10.6 CitizenCards issued before 7th January 2021 do not expire. All CitizenCards printed from 7th January 2021 onwards expire 3 years after issuing (rounded up to the end of the month the card was printed on). Cardholders can renew their membership if their card expired, they wish to obtain a higher age-band card or if their appearance has changed. Cardholders can also renew their existing CitizenCard if their name has changed legally since their previous CitizenCard was issued. Please note that if cardholder's name was changed legally, a copy of change of name deed or marriage certificate or Gender Recognition Certificate must be included with Replacement application.
