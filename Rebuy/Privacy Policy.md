    * Usage Information
        
        We, or our authorized third-party service providers, automatically collect technical and/or analytics information about how you use and/or interact with our Services (collectively, Usage Information), which may include (but is not necessarily limited to) identifiers, commercial information, and internet activity information such as IP address (or proxy server), mobile device number, device and application information, device event information, crash data, and log files and data, identification numbers and features, your approximate location (as determined through your IP address), browser type, plug-ins, integrations, Internet service provider or mobile carrier, the pages and files viewed, website and webpage interactions including searches and other actions you take, websites, apps and/or ads that referred you to the website, advertising and language preferences, operating system type and version, system configuration information, date and time stamps associated with your usage, and frequency of visits to the websites, and details of which of our products and product versions you are using.

        Typically, all Usage Information is collected in anonymous form and does not identify you personally. For example, some of the device and usage information collected, whether alone or in conjunction with other data, could identify you, although, except where strictly required to identify an individual for security purposes, such data and information is primarily used to identify the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals). However, to the extent any Usage Information is linked or tied to personally identifiable information, such information is deemed “personal data” and we will use it and protect it in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
        
    * Cookies and Similar Technologies
        
        We or authorized third parties may collect certain information (including, without limitation, Usage Information) by automated means using technologies such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, pixels, browser analysis tools, server logs, and mobile identifiers; however, even though we use these technologies to track the use of the Services, Rebuy does not directly track users across third party websites, provided that, certain targeting & advertising partners (as described below) may track you across websites. For more information on our use of these technologies, see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.rebuyengine.com/legal/cookie-policy).
        
    * Targeting & Advertising
        
        We may use third party advertising partners (e.g., Google, Inc., LinkedIn, Inc. and Facebook, Inc.) who use targeting/advertising cookies and similar technologies to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. For more information on our and/or third-party advertising partners' use of these targeting & advertising cookies and similar technologies, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.rebuyengine.com/legal/cookie-policy).

    * Data from our service providers, such as our analytics, advertising, marketing, and/or customer support providers.
    * Data from Third Party Integrations that you connect and/or use in connection with the use of the Services.
    
    #####

        For a list of all Service Providers we use, please [contact us](mailto:legal@rebuyengine.com). We require all Service Providers to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law.
        
    
    * **Disclosures Directed by Clients**
    
    We will share and disclose personal information of Authorized Users and Customers of a Client with the applicable Client, and otherwise in accordance with the Client’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Agreement, and in compliance with applicable law and legal process. If you are an Authorized User or Customer, please contact the Client to learn more about how your information may be used, shared and/or disclosed by us on behalf of the Client.
    
    * **Third Party Integrations**
    
    When you interact with and/or use Third Party Integrations in connection with the Services, certain data and information may be exchanged between us and the provider of the applicable Third Party Integration. Information that is shared with us through Third Party Integration is used by us as described in this Privacy Notice. Note that the Third Party Integrations you choose to interact with and/or use are not our service providers. The applicable providers of Third Party Integrations may use your personal information differently than we do and we do not control their use of your information. Please review the privacy notices for the Third Party Integrations.
    
    * **Advertising Partners**
    
    We may share your personal information with our third party advertising partners to provide ads that we think may interest you. For more information about our advertising and marketing practices and those of the third party advertising partners, please see please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.rebuyengine.com/legal/cookie-policy).
    
    * **Business Transfers**
    
    We may also share data with third parties to whom we choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal information in the same way as set out in this Privacy Notice.
    
    * Affiliates and Subsidiaries
        
        Personal information that we collect about you through or in connection with your use of the Services may be shared with the employees, contractors, and agents of Rebuy and our affiliated and subsidiary entities ("Affiliates") who are involved in providing or improving the Services that we offer to you. We obligate the employees, contractors and agents of Rebuy and our Affiliates to ensure the security and confidentiality of your personal information and to act on that personal information only in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice.
        
    * Legal Obligations and Security  
        Regulatory and Government Bodies - Compliance with Law
        
        We may disclose your information to regulatory agencies and official government bodies, as required to comply with or satisfy any laws, rules, or regulations applicable to Rebuy.
        
        Required Disclosures - Responding to Legal Orders
        
        If we are required to disclose personal information by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena, warrant or other judicial or administrative order, our policy is to respond to requests that are properly issued by law enforcement within the United States. Under such circumstances, unless prohibited by applicable law, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice that a request for your personal information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address. However, government requests may include a court-granted non-disclosure order, which prohibits us from giving notice to the affected individual. In cases where we receive a non-disclosure order, we will notify you when it has expired or once we are authorized to do so.
        
        If you are an Authorized User or Customer, please consult with the Client to learn more about how Client responds to requests for information pursuant to legal orders.
        
        Exigent Circumstances & Enforcement/Protection of Our Rights
        
        Your information, including the contents of all of your online communications in our Services and between you and Rebuy may be accessed and monitored as needed to provide our Service and may be disclosed to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, official government bodies, and other third parties, as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate:
        
        * To enforce our rights under our [General Website Terms of Use](https://www.rebuyengine.com/legal/terms-of-use), the Agreement, and/or any other terms and conditions applicable to the use of the Services;
        * In connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity or activity that may expose us or our affiliates, partners and/or agents to legal liability; and/or
        * If we receive information that provides us with a good faith belief that there is an exigent emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.
    * With your Consent
        
        There may be situations where you are asked to consent to share personal information with third parties for additional reasons not included in this Privacy Notice. In such event, we will only share such personal information if we have received your prior consent and only for the purposes as listed in the request to share such information.
        
9. #### MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
    
    If you are a registered user and have not otherwise opted out (or with your consent where required by applicable law), or if you have opted in to receive direct marketing emails from us, we may use your personal information to send you marketing information about the Services, new product releases, new feature releases of the Services, and/or other Rebuy products and services, that we think may interest you. We carry out direct marketing by email. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not send marketing communications to Customers of our Clients, unless such Customer has signed up directly with us to receive marketing communications from us.
    
    If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications, you have the right at any time to opt out as further explained in  [Your Choices](#your-choices).
    
10. #### YOUR CHOICES
    
    * Accessing, Updating and Correcting Personal information
        
        If you would like to correct or update certain personal information (such as your contact information), please [contact us](mailto:legal@rebuyengine.com) and we will use reasonable efforts to correct and/or update such information.
        
    * Additional European and International Data Rights
        
        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you may have additional rights you can exercise as described [here](#international-rights).
        
    * Additional European and International Data Rights
        
        You may manage the receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications sent by email by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located on the bottom of any of our marketing e-mails. To opt-out of marketing communications sent by physical mail, please [contact us](mailto:legal@rebuyengine.com) with your request.
        
        We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. Note that you cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails or communications related to the Services (e.g., requests for support), which, for clarification, are not marketing communications.
        
        If you are an Authorized User or Customer of a Client, please contact the Client if you wish to request the correction and/or update of personal information under their control.
        
    * Cookies & Targeted Advertising
        
        You can manage your cookie and tracking preferences as described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.rebuyengine.com/legal/cookie-policy).
        
11. #### THIRD PARTY SOCIAL MEDIA PLUG-INS
    
    On or through the Services we may provide third-party “share” buttons which enable you to share certain content via social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn). These “share” buttons may function as web beacons when you interact with the button. Please note that when you “share” using the buttons, you may send to the third party provider of the “share” button the information that you are viewing. If you are not logged into your account with the third party provider, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the Services to your account with the applicable third party provider. Please refer to each third party's privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.
    
12. #### EXTERNAL WEBSITES
    
    On or through the Services we may provide or make available, for informational purposes only, links to other websites or resources with which we do not have a contractual relationship and over which we do not have control ("External Websites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Rebuy of those External Websites, and are provided to you only as a convenience. By clicking on links to External Websites, the operators of the External Websites may collect your personal information. We are not responsible for the content or data collection practices of those External Websites, and your use of External Websites is subject to their respective terms of use and privacy policies.
    
13. #### DATA RETENTION
    
    Personal information is processed for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected, to comply with legal and regulatory obligations and for the duration of any period necessary to establish, exercise or defend any legal rights.
    
    In order to determine the most appropriate retention periods for your personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your information, the reasons for which we collect and process your personal information, and applicable legal requirements.
    
    In some instances, we may choose to anonymize personal information instead of deleting it. When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal information can be linked back to any specific individual.
    
14. #### DATA SECURITY AND PROTECTION
    
    We have put in place reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. For example, we use encryption, secure socket layer (SSL), firewalls, and password protection. In addition, we limit access to personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and the third parties who have a business need-to-know.
    
    We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and while we take reasonable steps to provide secure services, by using the Services, you understand and assume the risks associated with your activities on the internet.
    
    Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Services is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Services. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, we cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
    
15. #### CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS - SHINE THE LIGHT
    
    Rebuy does not share your personal information with any unaffiliated third party for its direct marketing purposes without your express consent.
    
    California residents who have provided us with personal information have the right (under California Civil Code§ 1798.83) to request and obtain from us, once each year, the details of any personal information we shared with a third party for that third party’s direct marketing purposes during the prior calendar year. The details would include the categories of personal information and the names and addresses of the third party with which it was shared.
    
    To request information about this sharing, you may submit a request with “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject line, along with your first and last name, and complete mailing address (including street address, city, state, and zip code) by either: sending an email message or writing to us at the email and/or mailing address specified in the [How to Contact Us](#how-to-contact-us) Section.
    
    If you do not submit and send your request with complete information as set forth above, we will not process it.
    
16. #### NEVADA PRIVACY RIGHTS
    
    Under Nevada law, Nevada “consumers” (individuals who are seeking or acquiring goods/services for personal, family, or household purposes) may opt out of the sale of covered personal information (which includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online) to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons.  
      
    Rebuy does not currently sell covered information of Nevada consumers as defined under applicable Nevada law; however, you may submit an opt-out request, which we will honor as required by Nevada law should we engage in such a sale in the future.  
      
    You may submit an opt-out request by sending an email message or writing to us at the email and/or mailing address specified in the [How to Contact Us](#how-to-contact-us) Section; along with your full name, any user name, and complete mailing address (including street address, city, state, and zip code), email address (so that we can contact you, if needed, in connection with the request) and confirmation that you are a Nevada resident.  
      
    You must provide us with information reasonably requested by us to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. We typically process these requests within 60 days from the day we receive it (and will notify you within that period if we need an additional 30 days to do so).
    
17. #### INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
    
    Rebuy is based in the United States. The personal information that we collect is sent to and stored on servers located in the United States. Such storage is necessary in order to process the information. Rebuy operates globally and may transfer the personal data that we collect from you to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above, which may be situated outside of your country or regional area, and may be processed by staff operating outside of your country or regional area. In particular, information provided to us or collected by us likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us or our Affiliates and our respective agents and contractors. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in your country of residence.  
      
    The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country in certain situations. We rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer personal information across borders. For example, we may enter into the EU Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the EU Commission. More information about the Standard Contractual Clauses is available [here](https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/1_en_annexe_acte_autonome_cp_part1_v5_0.pdf).
    
18. #### ADDITIONAL EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL DATA RIGHTS
    
    The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and certain other countries’ data protection laws provide certain rights for data subjects. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or another country with data protection laws that provide for certain data subject rights, you may submit a request to exercise your rights.
    
    We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
    
    * Depending on your country of residence, your rights may include:
    * The right to be informed - that’s an obligation on us to inform you how we use your personal data (and that’s what we’re doing in this Privacy Notice);
    * The right of access - that’s a right to make what’s known as a ‘data subject access request’ for a copy of the personal data we hold about you;
    * The right to rectification - that’s a right to make us correct personal data about you that may be incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your account);
    * The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’) - that’s where in certain circumstances you can ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless there’s an overriding legal reason we need to keep it);
    * The right to restrict processing - that’s a right for you in certain circumstances to ask us to suspend processing personal data;
    * The right to data portability - that’s a right for you to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file);
    * The right to object - that’s a right for you to object to us processing your personal data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing); and
    * Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling - that’s a right you have for us to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making.
    * Withdraw Consent—that’s the right to revoke any consent you may have previously given us at any time, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    * File a complaint—that’s the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority about our collection and processing of your personal information.
    
    _Exercising Your Rights_
    
    These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them. If you are located in the European Economic Area and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please [contact us](mailto:legal@rebuyengine.com).
    
    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
    
    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
    
    We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law.  
      
    In addition, if you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you. If you do so, we will promptly update our databases and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing the Services as requested and/or ordered by you or necessary updates regarding and the Services used by you.  
      
    Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please [contact us](mailto:legal@rebuyengine.com) first.
