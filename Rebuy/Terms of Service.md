Account Data is not Customer Content or Customer Data. 
    3. Customer Data & Customer Content. As between Customer and Rebuy, subject to the licenses expressly granted to Rebuy herein, Customer shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to Customer Data and Customer Content. Customer grants to Rebuy a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, worldwide right and license to use, process, reproduce, display, modify, incorporate, and perform the Customer Data and Customer Content for the purpose of hosting, operating, and providing the Rebuy Service and otherwise developing, improving, training, optimizing and otherwise exploiting in any medium Rebuy’s products, services and technologies during the term of the Agreement. Customer represents and warrants that: (i) Customer has all the rights and/or authorizations necessary to grant the Rebuy the licenses granted herein in and to Customer Data and Customer Content; and (ii) none of the Customer Data and/or Customer Content violates or will violate this Agreement, any applicable laws, rules or regulations, or any third party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights.
    4. Data Processing Addendum.

Each party shall comply with the Data Processing Addendum available at: \[https://www.rebuyengine.com/legal/data-processing-addendum\], the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.  
    5. Personal Data of Children. Customer agrees not to upload, transmit, and/or submit through, or in connection with the use of, Rebuy Service, or otherwise provide to Rebuy any personal data about individuals that Customer knows or has reason to know are under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in the applicable jurisdiction (e.g., 16 years of age if you are located in the EEA). If Customer discovers or reasonably believes that it has or may have uploaded, transmitted, submitted, and/or otherwise provided any personal data about individuals under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in the applicable jurisdiction to Rebuy and/or through, or in connection with the use of, the Rebuy Service, Customer agrees to, and shall, immediately remove such information from Rebuy’s systems (including, without limitation, the Rebuy Service and Customer’s Account) and immediately notify Rebuy of such occurrence.
3. #### ACCESS AND USE OF SERVICES
    
    1. Service Term; Trial Period. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of applicable fees), Rebuy will provide Customer access to the Rebuy Service during the Service Term (including any renewal thereof, and until the expiration of the last Service Term under each applicable Order Form). For the avoidance of doubt, Customer acknowledges and agrees that each Service Term will automatically renew for successive periods as set forth in the applicable Order Form (or if no such renewal period is set forth in the applicable Order Form, then for successive thirty (30) day periods), in each case unless Customer terminates this Agreement, and disconnects and ceases all use of the Rebuy Service, as set forth in Section 5.2 prior to the expiration of the then-current Service Term. If Customer has obtained the Rebuy Service on a trial-basis, Customer will have a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date Customer first connects the Rebuy Service to the Customer Store or such other period expressly agreed to in writing by Rebuy, to use the Rebuy Service on a trial-basis (the “Trial Period”). Customer acknowledges and agrees that upon expiration of the Trial Period, the Service Term will automatically start, and Customer will automatically be charged for applicable Service Fees due and payable for Customer’s applicable Service Tier in accordance with Section 4, unless Customer terminates this Agreement, and disconnects, and ceases all use of the Rebuy Service, as set forth in Section 5.2 prior to the end of the Trial Period.
    2. Access to the Platform. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of applicable fees), Rebuy grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable limited right during the Trial Period, if applicable, and the Service Term, to: (i) permit Authorized Users to access and use the Platform, over the internet, to generate and deploy Widgets; (ii) to install the Implementation Code on the Customer Store to connect the Rebuy Service and deploy and display the applicable Widgets on the Customer Store; and (iii), reproduce and use a reasonable number of copies of the Documentation in support of the exercise of the licenses and rights granted in this Section 3.2. The licenses granted to Customer hereunder are limited to Customer’s use for its own internal business purposes, in accordance with this Agreement and the Documentation, and subject to any applicable Usage Parameters. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE TRIAL VERSION IS PROVIDED “AS-IS” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE REBUY ROI GUARANTEE SET FORTH IN SECTION 6, OR ANY SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY UPDATES OR UPGRADES).
    3. Access to Beta-Version and Features. From time to time, Rebuy, in its sole discretion, may make certain beta versions of and/or beta features and/or functionality of the Rebuy Service available to Customer to try at its option at no additional charge which are clearly designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description (collectively, “**Beta Version and Features**”). For the avoidance of doubt, any Beta Version and Features made available by Rebuy to Customer hereunder are included in the defined term “The Rebuy Service” as used throughout this Agreement. If Customer elects to access Beta Version and Features made available to Customer by Rebuy, Rebuy grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right to access and use the Beta Version and Features solely for Customer’s internal evaluation and subject to any and all technical limitations implemented in the Beta Versions and Features and/or other usage parameters or restrictions specified by Rebuy for the Beta Version and Features. In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3.4 below, Customer shall not access and/or use the Beta Version and Features (i) for purposes of monitoring their availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purpose, or (ii) without the express prior written approval of Rebuy if Customer is a direct competitor of Rebuy. In addition, Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Beta Versions and Features and any Feedback (as defined below in Section 3.7) regarding the Beta Versions and Features are the confidential information of Rebuy and Customer shall not disclose any such confidential information to any third party. BETA VERSION AND FEATURES ARE PROVIDED AS-IS, ARE NOT SUPPORTED, AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TERMS AS SPECIFIED BY REBUY IN WRITING AND/OR IN THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE BETA VERSION AND FEATURES. Rebuy reserves the right to terminate Customer’s access to any Beta Versions and Features at any time, for any reason.
    4. Restrictions and Prohibited Uses. Customer agrees that Customer will not, and it will not permit any third party (including, without limitation, any Authorized User) to: (i) modify, adapt, translate or create derivative works based on the Rebuy Service (or any part thereof) or Documentation; (ii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise derive or determine or attempt to derive or determine the source code (or the underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organization) of the Platform, Widgets and/or Implementation Code; (iii) distribute, license, sublicense, assign, transfer or otherwise make available to any third party the Rebuy Service (or any part thereof) and/or Documentation; (iv) remove, alter, or obscure in any way any proprietary rights notices (including copyright notices) of Rebuy or its suppliers on or within the Rebuy Service and/or Documentation; (v) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Rebuy Service (or any part thereof), or any system, network or data or cause or aid in the cause of the destruction, manipulation, removal, disabling, or impairment of any portion of the Rebuy Service; (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Rebuy Service (or any part thereof), or its related systems or networks; (vii) frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose the Rebuy Service or any portion thereof; (viii) use any meta tags, “hidden text”, robots, spiders, crawlers, or other tools, whether manual or automated, to collect, scrape, index, mine, republish, redistribute, transmit, sell, license or download the Rebuy Service, content, or the personal information of others without Rebuy’s prior written permission or authorization; (ix) use the Rebuy Service (or any part thereof) to hack, spam, or phish Rebuy or Rebuy’s other users; (x) use the Rebuy Service to store or transmit any malicious or unsolicited code or software, or store, transmit or upload any material and/or content that is false, inaccurate, illegal, abusive, harassing, harmful to reputation, pornographic, indecent, profane, obscene, hateful, racist, infringing, libelous, tortious, or otherwise objectionable in Rebuy’s reasonable opinion, or to store, transmit or upload any material or content that violates any third party’s intellectual property rights and/or privacy rights; (xi) impersonate any person or entity, use a fictitious name, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent Customer’s affiliation with any person or entity; or (xii) violate any applicable local, state, national or international law (including, without limitation, U.S. and foreign export laws concerning the transmission of technical data and other regulated materials) in Customer’s use of the Rebuy Service.
    5. Third Party Integrations.
