    3. Customer Data & Customer Content.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of applicable fees), Rebuy will provide Customer access to the Rebuy Service during the Service Term (including any renewal thereof, and until the expiration of the last Service Term under each applicable Order Form). For the avoidance of doubt, Customer acknowledges and agrees that each Service Term will automatically renew for successive periods as set forth in the applicable Order Form (or if no such renewal period is set forth in the applicable Order Form, then for successive thirty (30) day periods), in each case unless Customer terminates this Agreement, and disconnects and ceases all use of the Rebuy Service, as set forth in Section 5.2 prior to the expiration of the then-current Service Term. If Customer has obtained the Rebuy Service on a trial-basis, Customer will have a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date Customer first connects the Rebuy Service to the Customer Store or such other period expressly agreed to in writing by Rebuy, to use the Rebuy Service on a trial-basis (the ‚ÄúTrial Period‚Äù). Customer acknowledges and agrees that upon expiration of the Trial Period, the Service Term will automatically start, and Customer will automatically be charged for applicable Service Fees due and payable for Customer‚Äôs applicable Service Tier in accordance with Section 4, unless Customer terminates this Agreement, and disconnects, and ceases all use of the Rebuy Service, as set forth in Section 5.2 prior to the end of the Trial Period.
    2. Access to the Platform. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of applicable fees), Rebuy grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable limited right during the Trial Period, if applicable, and the Service Term, to: (i) permit Authorized Users to access and use the Platform, over the internet, to generate and deploy Widgets; (ii) to install the Implementation Code on the Customer Store to connect the Rebuy Service and deploy and display the applicable Widgets on the Customer Store; and (iii), reproduce and use a reasonable number of copies of the Documentation in support of the exercise of the licenses and rights granted in this Section 3.2.

CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE TRIAL VERSION IS PROVIDED ‚ÄúAS-IS‚Äù AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE REBUY ROI GUARANTEE SET FORTH IN SECTION 6, OR ANY SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY UPDATES OR UPGRADES).
    3. Access to Beta-Version and Features. From time to time, Rebuy, in its sole discretion, may make certain beta versions of and/or beta features and/or functionality of the Rebuy Service available to Customer to try at its option at no additional charge which are clearly designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description (collectively, ‚Äú**Beta Version and Features**‚Äù). For the avoidance of doubt, any Beta Version and Features made available by Rebuy to Customer hereunder are included in the defined term ‚ÄúThe Rebuy Service‚Äù as used throughout this Agreement. If Customer elects to access Beta Version and Features made available to Customer by Rebuy, Rebuy grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right to access and use the Beta Version and Features solely for Customer‚Äôs internal evaluation and subject to any and all technical limitations implemented in the Beta Versions and Features and/or other usage parameters or restrictions specified by Rebuy for the Beta Version and Features. In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3.4 below, Customer shall not access and/or use the Beta Version and Features (i) for purposes of monitoring their availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purpose, or (ii) without the express prior written approval of Rebuy if Customer is a direct competitor of Rebuy. In addition, Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Beta Versions and Features and any Feedback (as defined below in Section 3.7) regarding the Beta Versions and Features are the confidential information of Rebuy and Customer shall not disclose any such confidential information to any third party. BETA VERSION AND FEATURES ARE PROVIDED AS-IS, ARE NOT SUPPORTED, AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TERMS AS SPECIFIED BY REBUY IN WRITING AND/OR IN THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE BETA VERSION AND FEATURES. Rebuy reserves the right to terminate Customer‚Äôs access to any Beta Versions and Features at any time, for any reason.
