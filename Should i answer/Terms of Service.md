Terms of Use
============

Short version
-------------

**Look, it's simple.**

* We provide two services - the web pages shouldianswer.net and connected pages, and the mobile application. Both products are for free, and there is no warranty.
* The web pages serve as open discussion - we provide a wall (or a board), you can write on it. You are fully responsible for what you write, don't blame us. On the other hand, whatever you wrote then belongs to us (and we can delete it if needed).
* If you write something rude, bad, using inpropriate language, don't be surprised if we delete such texts.
* We don't collect personal data - either from the mobile application or from the pages (only for direct purposes connected with the service, please check the Privacy policy). Please never ever write, send, post any personal data to our pages.
* Well, we are resposible for acting as a cleaners of the board, so if you find something bad on our pages, just use the basket icon under the respective review and write to us, we will clear anything bad without hesitation.

### WHAT TO DO IF ...

* If there is a post containing false information, personal data, negative post which you feel is not correct (or e.g. touching Your company or number), there is always a few ways how to deal with it.
* If the post is touching your company-used number, write your own explanatory review and/or reply to the post and try to explain why and how the number is used, show the users that your company takes a big care for the users - please always try to communicate with your clients first using a dialogue. We strongly believe that most of the negative posts are just a result of misunderstanding the service the respective number offers.

But please be warned that we are not able to act as the judging body and you should probably pursue legal action against the author (finding out who is the author). Our team will try to provide the correction in the shortest time possible, but in some cases this will not be easily maintained.
