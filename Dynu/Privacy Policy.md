INTERNATIONAL USERS AND DATA TRANSFERS  
  
The Service is hosted in the United States and is intended for users located both within and outside the United States. If you choose to use the Service from the European Economic Area (EEA) or other countries that have laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. By providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Service, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing. Note that there are risks to permitting such transfers, as the laws of the U.S. or other jurisdictions may not provide you with privacy guarantees, remedies, or other protection equivalent to those of the EEA or the country where you are located.  
  
CHILDREN  
  
Our websites and services are not directed at individuals under the age of thirteen (13). We will not intentionally collect or maintain information about these individuals. If you believe that We may have collected Personal Data from someone under the age of 13, please let us know by emailing dc@dynu.com. We will then take appropriate measures to investigate and, if appropriate, delete that information.  
  
HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA  
  
We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you with the Services or as long as needed to fulfill the purpose for which the Personal Data was originally collected. We may also be required to retain certain information by law and/or for legitimate business.  
  
YOUR RIGHTS  
  
You may instruct Us to provide You with any Personal Data We hold about you, provided Your request is not found to be unfounded or excessive, in which case a charge may apply. We may withhold personal information that you request to the extent permitted by law.  
You may instruct us at any time not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. The rights you have under the GDPR are:  
  

* the right to access;  
    You have the right to ask us to confirm whether or not We process your Personal Data and, to have access to the Personal Data, and any additional information. That additional information includes the purposes for which We process your data, the categories of Personal Data We hold and the recipients of that Personal Data. You may request a copy of your Personal Data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but We may charge a reasonable fee for additional copies.
* the right to rectification;  
    If we hold any inaccurate Personal Data about you, you have the right to have these inaccuracies rectified. Where necessary for the purposes of the processing, you also have the right to have any incomplete Personal Data about you completed.
* the right to erasure;  
    In certain circumstances you have the right to have Personal Data that We hold about you erased. This will be done without undue delay. These circumstances include the following: it is no longer necessary for us to hold those Personal Data in relation to the purposes for which they were originally collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw your consent to any processing which requires consent; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are certain general exclusions of the right to erasure, including where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for establishing, exercising or defending legal claims.
* the right to restrict processing;  
    In certain circumstances you have the right for the processing of your Personal Data to be restricted. This is the case where: you do not think that the Personal Data We hold about you is accurate; your data is being processed unlawfully, but you do not want your data to be erased; it is no longer necessary for us to hold your Personal Data for the purposes of our processing, but you still require that Personal Data in relation to a legal claim; and you have objected to processing, and are waiting for that objection to be verified. Where processing has been restricted for one of these reasons, We may continue to store your Personal Data. However, We will only process it for other reasons: with your consent; in relation to a legal claim; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
* the right to object to processing;  
    You can object to us processing your Personal Data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only as far as our legal basis for the processing is that it is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party. If you make an objection, We will stop processing your personal information unless We are able to: demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, and that these legitimate grounds override your interests, rights and freedoms; or the processing is in relation to a legal claim.
* the right to data portability;  
    You have the right to request that your Personal Data be moved, copied or transferred from one database, storage or IT environment to another.
* the right to complain to a supervisory authority;  
    If You think that our processing of Your Personal Data infringes data protection laws, You can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.
* the right to withdraw consent; and  
    To the extent that the legal basis We are relying on for processing Your Personal Data is consent, You are entitled to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
* the right to object to direct marketing  
    You can choose whether We process Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. If You do not want Us to process Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, We will not process Your Personal Data for this purpose. You can exercise Your right to prevent such processing by editing your personal preferences in the control panel.

  
If You wish to:  
  

* Request access to, deletion of or correction of, Your Personal Data. Please contact Us to arrange this at dc@dynu.com. We must make You aware that due to regulations which control the use of the internet, Registries such as Nominet and ICANN may not delete Your information until a period of time has lapsed.
