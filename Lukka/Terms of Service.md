Terms Of Use
============

[Home](https://lukka.tech/) › Terms of Use

1\. Introduction and Purpose
----------------------------

The purpose of the Site is to provide Users with access to our products (the “Products”) and services (the “Services”) as offered by the Company from time to time. Should you have any questions or comments regarding our Site, Products, and/or Services, please feel free to contact us at https://lukka.tech/contact-us/.

2\. Preliminary Provisions
--------------------------

**2.1 Terms of Use**  
Through these Terms of Use, we are placing legal conditions on your use of the Site and making certain promises to you. You must agree to all of the conditions in these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to or accept all the conditions of these Terms of Use, please immediately discontinue access to and use of the Site, Products, and/or Services. If you are under the age of eighteen (18) or the legal age for entering legally binding contracts under applicable laws, you are not permitted to use this Site at all. Misrepresentation of your age to gain access to our Site is considered a breach of these Terms of Use and may constitute as computer hacking under applicable law.

**2.2 Right to Counsel**  
If you do not understand all of the terms in these Terms of Use, then you should consult with a lawyer before using the Site, Products, and/or Services.

**2.3 Party Definitions and Introductory Terms**  
The Company is the owner and operator of the Site, Products, and/or Services. In these Terms of Use, all references to the “Company” shall mean Lukka, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, affiliates, and other group companies. Additionally, when first-person pronouns are used in these Terms of Use (us, we, our, ours, etc.), these provisions are referring to the Company as publisher of this Site and provider of the Products and the Services.  
The “Site” shall refer to any website managed by the Company, including, without limitation, lukka.tech, coinfirm.com, and other websites which are part of the lukka.tech, coinfirm.com and domains. The services the Site provides, including the Products and any ancillary services, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Services.”  
The Site may contain images and content, including, but not limited to, text, software, images, graphics, data, messages or any other information, and any other website content owned, operated, licensed, or controlled by the Company (collectively, “Materials”).  
As the user of this Site (the “User”), these Terms of Use will refer to the User as “you” or through any second-person pronouns, such as “your,” “yours,” etc. Hereinafter, the User of the Site shall be referred to in applicable second-person pronouns.  
For the purposes of these Terms of Use, all Customers (as defined below) are Users, but not all Users are Customers. These Terms of Use apply to all Users, whether they are Customers or not. You become a User by accessing this Site in any way. You need not become a Customer of the Site to make these Terms of Use apply to you.  
You become a “Customer” by entering into a binding legal agreement with the Company relating to use of the Products or Services, including, without limitation, a “service agreement” or “trial agreement” (each, a “Customer Agreement”), and the Company thereafter registering you with the Site using a Customer ID and password, as discussed below. Only Customers may access the Products and Services. Hereinafter, the Company and you may collectively be referred to as the “Parties” and each, a “Party”.

**2.4 Intent to Be Bound**  
THESE TERMS OF USE ARE A LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY. YOU SHOULD TREAT IT AS ANY OTHER LEGAL CONTRACT BY READING ITS PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY WILL AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. BY ACCESSING THE SITE OR USING THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU ARE DEEMED TO HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OF USE. YOU MAY NOT PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH TERMS APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS IN THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU MUST CEASE ALL ACCESS AND USE OF THE SITE AND ANY OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE IS INTENDED TO CREATE ANY ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS BY THIRD PARTIES.

**2.5 Consideration**  
Consideration for your acquiescence to all of the provisions in these Terms of Use has been provided to you in the form of allowing you to use the Site, Products, and/or Services, including in the case of a Customer, entrance into a Customer Agreement. You agree that such consideration is both adequate and is received upon your viewing or using any portion of the Site, Products, and/or Services.

**2.6 Electronic Signatures / Assent Required**  
No one is authorized or allowed to access this Site, the Products, and/or Services, unless he, she, they, or it has signed these Terms of Use. Such signature does not need to be a physical signature, since electronic acceptance of these Terms of Use is permitted by various jurisdictions’ laws, such as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) and similar legislation. You manifest your agreement to these Terms of Use by taking any act demonstrating your assent thereto. If you click any link, button, or other device provided to you in any part of our Site’s interface, then you have legally agreed to all of these Terms of Use. By using any part of our Site in any manner or by entering into a Customer Agreement, you understand and agree that such use constitutes your affirmation of your complete and unconditional acceptance to all of the terms in these Terms of Use. You should understand that this has the same legal effect as you placing your physical signature on any other legal contract. Even if you fail to sign these Terms of Use, you understand and agree that you are still bound by the terms of these Terms of Use by virtue of your viewing the Site or using any portion of the Site, Products, and/or Services.

**2.7 Illegal Activities**  
If you are seeking information regarding any illegal activities or seeking to engage in any illegal or fraudulent financial activity, please leave this Site immediately and do not attempt to use the Site. You acknowledge and agree that you are aware of the legality of using our Site in your relevant local jurisdiction, and you agree that you will not use the Site, if such use is prohibited or otherwise violates the laws of your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction.

**2.8 Revisions to these Terms of Use**  
From time to time, we may revise these Terms of Use. We reserve the right to do so, in our sole and absolute discretion, and you agree that we have this unilateral right. Your continued use of the Site shall be deemed acceptance of the then prevailing terms and conditions. You agree that all modifications or changes to these Terms of Use are in force and enforceable immediately upon posting. Any updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect, unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions thereof in effect. To the extent any amendment of these Terms of Use is deemed ineffective or invalid by any court, the Parties intend that the prior, effective provisions of these Terms of Use be considered valid and enforceable to the fullest extent, and all remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Any updated version of these Terms of Use will include a new “last modified” date at the top of these Terms of Use in order to identify the then-currently applicable Terms of Use. Following the posting of the updated version of these Terms of Use on our Site, please re-review these Terms of Use in order to ensure that you understand how your rights and responsibilities may have been affected by the revisions. If you fail to periodically review this Site and these Terms of Use to determine if any of the terms have changed, you assume all responsibility for your failure to do so and you agree that such failure amounts to your affirmative waiver of your right to review the amended terms. We are not responsible for your neglect of your legal rights.

3\. Explanation of Customers
----------------------------

**3.1 Access and Limited License**  
All Users may access certain public areas of the Site; however, only Customers may use the Products or Services. You understand that all we are providing to you is access to our Site as we provide it. You are solely responsible for acquiring any hardware, software, device, Internet access and other items required for you to use or access the Site and utilize our Products, and/or Services. Any associated fees, expenses or other charges that you incur to access our Site and use of our Products and Services are your sole responsibility. These Terms of Use cover all public and non-public areas of the Site.

**3.2 Digital Assets**  
Virtual currency is not provided or issued to our Customers via the Site, Products, and/or Services. All information with respect to any digital assets (“Digital Assets”), entered or inputted into our Products by Customers originates from the Customers themselves. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of your Digital Assets, and that the Company does not give advice or recommendations regarding Digital Assets, including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, Digital Assets. You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use the Site, Products, and/or Services, at your own risk. This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with trading in Digital Assets. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.

**3.3 Digital Asset Values**  
Our Products use third party market value data to value your Digital Assets in connection with our Services to you. You understand and agree that, due to technical and other restrictions, any Digital Asset market values displayed or otherwise incorporated or used on the Site, Products, and/or Services, may be delayed and therefore not reflect the current, live market value of such Digital Asset. Nonetheless, you agree that the market value data as displayed on our Site controls your use of the Site, Products, and/or Services. You also agree that we are not responsible for any failure or outage in the market value data provided by third parties and used or incorporated on the Site, Products, and Services. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that the sources of any such third party market value data shall be selected at the Company’s discretion and the Company is not required to use any information provided to it by such third parties. THE COMPANY ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO IT BY ANY THIRD PARTY AND SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE INFORMATION AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTAINED IN ANY THIRD PARTY MARKET VALUE DATA

**3.4 No Legal or Tax Advice**  
By using this Site, Products, and/or Services, you acknowledge that the Company does not handle, advise or otherwise manage your tax or legal services and in no event do the Site, Products, and/or Services provide, nor is the Company providing, nor intending to provide, legal, tax, accounting, or compliance advice. In addition, any regulatory or export compliance is solely your responsibility and is subject to your own diligence and actions.  
Furthermore, none of our customer support team members give tax or legal advice. Our support team exists to help explain our Products and Services. You agree to not rely on any support communications as investment, legal, or tax advice. You hereby disclaim any claim against the Company relating to communications from our support team.

**3.5 Your Account; Registration Data**  
In order to use the Products, you must enter into a Customer Agreement with us and we will then set up an account for you on the Site (your “Account”). In creating your Account, you may be asked to provide certain registration details and information. In order to verify your identity, some of this information may be personal, private or detailed. In connection with completing the online registration form, you agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form (such information being the “Registration Data”); and you further agree to maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete at all times while you are a Customer. While we use reasonable efforts to protect the personal information of others from inadvertent release or misappropriation, we are not responsible for the intentional or criminal acts of third parties such as hackers or “phishers.” Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information on the use of your personal information. You must promptly inform us of all changes to your Registration Data.

**3.6 Your Account Responsibility**  
You are entirely responsible for any and all activities conducted through your Account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or Customer ID, as well as of any other breach of security. We are not responsible for any unauthorized use of your Account, and you agree that you are responsible for such unauthorized use and for protecting the confidentiality of your Customer ID and password. To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, you acknowledge and agree that the Company will have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate Registration Data, including your failure to receive important information and updates about the Products. If the Company or any of its authorized agents have reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provided to us is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site, Products, and/or Services, or any portion thereof, by you, as well as subject you to civil liability or refer you to the appropriate law enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Customer ID or password or if your device(s) on which you have linked your Account with a digital wallet has been lost or stolen or otherwise suffered unauthorized access, or any other actual or potential security breach relating to your Account.
