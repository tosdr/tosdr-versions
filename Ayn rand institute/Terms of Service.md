Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed User Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at ARI’s sole discretion.

**NO PROFESSIONAL ADVICE**

The information available on the Site is intended to be a general information resource regarding the matters covered and is not tailored to your specific circumstance. You should not construe this as legal, accounting or other professional advice. YOU SHOULD EVALUATE ALL INFORMATION, OPINIONS AND ADVICE AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE IN CONSULTATION WITH YOUR INSURANCE SPECIALIST, OR WITH YOUR LEGAL, TAX, FINANCIAL OR OTHER ADVISOR, AS APPROPRIATE.

**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

**a. Limitation of Damages.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AYN RAND INSTITUTE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE; OR (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR USER TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF AYN RAND INSTITUTE EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID AYN RAND INSTITUTE, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT AYN RAND INSTITUTE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

**b. Release of Liability.**

ARI, using our sole discretion, may take any action with respect to User Content that we deem necessary or appropriate, especially if we believe that such User Content could create liability for ARI, damage ARI’s brand or public image or cause ARI to lose, in whole or in part, the services of its ISPs or other suppliers.

While ARI reserves the right to remove User Content and other material, ARI does not assume any obligation to do so and disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action. ARI also has no control over the accuracy, reliability, completeness or timeliness of User Content and makes no representations about such User Content. Under no circumstances will ARI be liable for any User Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any User Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any User Content submitted, posted, displayed or otherwise made available via the App or broadcast elsewhere.

While ARI complies with the strict privacy procedures outlined in the [ARI Privacy Policy](https://aynrand.org/privacy-policy), we expect you to use caution and common sense when using our Site and to recognize the risks involved with submitting sensitive content, especially personally identifiable information.

If you are a California resident, you agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states:

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.

Understand that ARI will be relieved of all liability arising from unknown or unsuspected claims. Since we do not and cannot be involved in dealings between users or control the behavior of users outside the Site, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users or non-users regarding use of the Site, you release ARI (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

ARI cannot guarantee and does not promise any specific results from use on the site. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by a user from ARI shall create any warranty not expressly stated herein.

**ARBITRATION**

Except as regarding any action seeking equitable relief, including without limitation for the purpose of protecting any ARI confidential information and/or intellectual property rights, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or this Site shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules, in effect at the time the proceedings begin, of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be held in the Central District of California.

All information relating to, or disclosed by, any party in connection with the arbitration of any disputes hereunder shall be treated by the parties, their representatives and the arbitrator as proprietary business information. Such information shall not be disclosed by any party or their respective representative(s) without the prior written authorization of the party furnishing such information. Such information shall not be disclosed by the arbitrator without the prior written authorization of all parties. Each party shall bear the burden of its own counsel fees incurred in connection with any arbitration proceedings.

Judgment upon the award returned by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their assets or application of enforcement, as the case may be. Any award by the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties. The parties hereby waive all rights to judicial review of the arbitrator’s decision and any award contained therein.

**GENERAL TERMS**
