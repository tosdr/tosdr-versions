If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use BlancVPN.

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the revised Terms on our website and update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom.

3\. OUR SERVICES
----------------

BlancVPN provides virtual private network (VPN) services that encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address. When you connect to BlancVPN, your data is routed through our secure servers in various locations worldwide. This helps protect your online privacy and security.

As part of our commitment to privacy, BlancVPN maintains a strict no-logs policy. We do not collect, store, or share any information about your online activities while connected to our VPN, including your browsing history, traffic destination, data content. We store only the minimum amount of information necessary for the operation of our Services.

At the same time, we are highly against any illegal, criminal, or fraudulent actions committed when using BlancVPN Services. Since we do not store information about your actions while using the Services, you are solely responsible for such actions. BlancVPN is not responsible in any way for illegal actions that may be committed when using our Services.

We may use your email for marketing purposes, and you can opt out of receiving these emails at any time.

While we strive to provide a reliable and secure service, BlancVPN cannot guarantee that our Services will always be available or error-free. We may need to temporarily suspend access to our Services for maintenance, upgrades, or other reasons. Additionally, BlancVPN does not warrant that our Services are compatible with all devices or will meet your specific requirements.

You agree not to use BlancVPN to upload, download, store, share, or transmit any content that is illegal itself or facilitates illegal activities ("Prohibited Content").

By using BlancVPN, you agree to comply with all relevant export and import regulations in your jurisdiction.

5\. FAIR USE
------------

All BlancVPN subscriptions are intended for reasonable personal use. Our Services are not designed for large-scale commercial use or for re-distribution to multiple users.

While we do not set fixed limits on bandwidth or simultaneous connections, we reserve the right to monitor usage patterns and take appropriate action against accounts that are not using our Services fairly or are negatively impacting our network performance.

Examples of unfair use may include, but are not limited to:

* Using an excessive number of simultaneous connections from multiple devices or locations

* Sharing your BlancVPN account credentials with others or enabling access for unauthorized users
* Using BlancVPN on behalf of or for the benefit of a business, organization, or institution
* Using BlancVPN for commercial purposes

Fair use restrictions are necessary to prevent abuse and ensure all users can enjoy a high-quality experience with BlancVPN. If we determine that your usage constitutes a violation of these fair use terms or is otherwise detrimental to our Services, we may:

* Contact you to discuss your usage and propose a more suitable subscription plan
* Throttle your connection speeds or limit your available server locations
* Suspend or terminate your BlancVPN account without notice or refund

By using BlancVPN, you acknowledge that our Services are not intended for activities that generate large amounts of traffic or place excessive demands on our network infrastructure. We encourage you to use BlancVPN responsibly to protect your privacy.

6\. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND PAYMENTS
------------------------------

BlancVPN offers various paid subscription plans. The specific terms of each subscription plan are described on our website and apps at the time of purchase.

When you purchase a BlancVPN subscription, you agree to pay the applicable fees and any taxes that may apply based on your location. Subscription prices are subject to change. We will notify you in advance of any price increases.

BlancVPN subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of each subscription term until you cancel. Your payment method will be charged on the renewal date. By entering your payment details, you agree to the automatic renewal of your subscription. You can disable automatic renewals through your BlancVPN account dashboard at any time or by contacting our support team. If we are unable to process your subscription payment, we may suspend your access to our Services until payment is received.

Payments for BlancVPN subscriptions are processed by third-party payment providers. The exact amount charged may vary slightly from the listed price based on currency conversions or fees charged by your payment method provider. For the most accurate pricing information in your local currency, please contact our support team.

7\. REFUNDS
-----------

Your satisfaction with BlancVPN is our top priority. If you are not completely happy with our paid Services, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can request a refund within 30 days of your initial purchase, and we will fully refund your payment.

Before requesting a refund, we encourage you to contact our support team at [\[email protected\]](https://blancvpn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or on our website so we can try to resolve any issues you may be experiencing.

You are eligible for up to two refunds. After your first refund, you can request a second refund only if at least 6 months have passed since your previous refund. If you purchase our Services again after receiving two refunds, you will not be eligible for any additional refunds.

For monthly subscriptions, the 30-day refund window applies only to the initial purchase. Once a monthly subscription renews, it is no longer eligible for a refund under our money-back guarantee.

In exceptional cases, we may consider offering a partial refund beyond the 30-day period if you can demonstrate that our Services were unavailable or unusable for a significant portion of your subscription term, and you made reasonable efforts to contact us about the issue. Partial refunds will be prorated based on the number of days the Services were not available during your subscription period.

Refunds are not available for purchases made with prepaid cards or gift cards. For payments made in cryptocurrency, we will refund you the equivalent US Dollar amount in the same cryptocurrency based on the exchange rate at the time of the refund.

If you purchased your BlancVPN subscription through a third-party reseller or app store, refunds will be processed according to that provider's refund policies. Please contact the reseller or app store directly to request a refund.

BlancVPN reserves the right to withhold a refund if we determine that you have violated our Terms of Service. We also reserve the right to verify your account information before processing a refund, which may result in a short delay.

Any taxes or fees charged on your BlancVPN purchase are determined by your location and applicable tax laws. Refund amounts will be exclusive of any taxes BlancVPN is required to collect.

Deleting your account does not automatically qualify you for a refund. If you delete your account, you will lose access to BlancVPN, but you will not receive a refund for any unused portion of your subscription period.

8\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
-------------------------

The BlancVPN website, apps, services, and all associated content, including software, logos, text, images, and videos, are the exclusive property of BlancVPN and its licensors, protected by intellectual property laws. By using our Services, you do not acquire any ownership rights to BlancVPN.

These Terms grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use BlancVPN for your personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to your compliance with these Terms. You may not reproduce, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works of BlancVPN without our prior written consent.

If you provide BlancVPN with any feedback, suggestions, or ideas related to our Services, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive license to use and implement your feedback without any restriction or compensation to you.

9\. DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
-------------------------------------------

BlancVPN is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Your use of our Services is at your own risk.

We do not warrant that BlancVPN will be uninterrupted, error-free, completely secure, or free from viruses or other harmful components. BlancVPN is not liable for any failures, delays, or interruptions in our Services, or any data loss, corruption, or breach that may occur while using our Services.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall BlancVPN, its directors, employees, partners, suppliers, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or opportunities, arising out of or in connection with your use of BlancVPN, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Our total aggregate liability for any claims related to BlancVPN shall be limited to the subscription fees you paid us in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

10\. INDEMNIFICATION
--------------------

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BlancVPN, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from any claims, demands, damages, expenses, or liabilities, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of our Services, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any rights of a third party.

BlancVPN reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume exclusive control of the defense of any matter subject to indemnification by you. In such cases, you agree to cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.

11\. TERMINATION
----------------

BlancVPN reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to our Services at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms. We may also terminate inactive accounts or unpaid accounts at our discretion.

If BlancVPN terminates your account due to your breach of these Terms, you will not receive a refund for any prepaid subscription fees, and you may be prohibited from registering for our Services in the future.

You may cancel your BlancVPN subscription at any time through your account dashboard. Cancellations will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. Except for the 30-day money-back guarantee on your initial purchase, refunds will not be issued for partial billing periods.

12\. MODIFICATIONS AND SEVERABILITY
-----------------------------------

BlancVPN reserves the right to modify our Services at any time, without prior notice. We may need to add, change, or remove features, or suspend part of our Services temporarily or permanently. In the event of a material change or discontinued Service, we will notify subscribers and provide a prorated refund for any unused portion of their subscription.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or term of these Terms shall not be considered a waiver of such right or term.

13\. PREVAILING LANGUAGE
------------------------

The original language of these Terms of Service is English. BlancVPN may provide translated versions of the Terms as a courtesy to users. However, in the event of any conflict or discrepancy between the English version and a translated version, the English version shall prevail and be considered the authoritative and binding agreement between you and BlancVPN.
