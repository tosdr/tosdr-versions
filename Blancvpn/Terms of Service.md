What services does BlancVPN provide?
------------------------------------

BlancVPN provides services to gain access to virtual private networks (virtual private network or VPN) and other services to ensure privacy and security (hereinafter referred to as "Services").

VPN is an effective way to secure your online activities by encrypting your internet traffic. VPN does not allow third parties to track your online activities. BlancVPN provides VPN connection services to servers around the world, ensuring the security of your Internet connection.

One of the key features of BlancVPN is that we do not collect, store or transfer to third parties any data about your use of Internet connections and traffic while you use our Services. We do not collect any information about what and how you do on the Internet, including information about your IP address, visited sites and downloaded files.

We store only the minimum amount of information necessary for the operation of the Services. You can read more about what information we collect and store in our Privacy Policy.

At the same time, we do not approve of any illegal, criminal or fraudulent actions committed when using the BlancVPN Services. Since we do not store information about your actions when using the Services, you are solely responsible for such actions. BlancVPN is not responsible in any way for illegal actions that may be committed when using our Services.

We may use your e-mail in marketing purposes. But we promise that it won't be spam.

How can I use BlancVPN services?
--------------------------------

BlancVPN services are available for use through this Website, Telegram bot, applications for PC and mobile devices. The full list can be found in the information section of the Site.

To use some Services, you may need to register. You are fully responsible for access to your account used to access the Services, as well as for the actions of third parties committed using your account. If third parties gain access to your account, you are obliged to inform us as soon as possible. We reserve the right to block your account if it is used by third parties.

How are payments, auto-renewals and refunds arranged in BlancVPN?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Access to some BlancVPN Services is provided by subscription. When purchasing a subscription to BlancVPN Services for the first time, the user selects the access period. At the end of the access period, the subscription is renewed automatically, unless otherwise specified at the time of subscription to the Services.

For renewal, the payment method used at the time of the first purchase of the subscription or selected by the user in the personal account is used. Automatic extensions of the access period to the Services will occur until the user cancels the subscription to the Services.

By entering the payment data, you agree that they will be used to automatically extend the access period. You also agree that they will be saved by the payment provider to automatically extend the access period. We will notify you in advance about the upcoming debit by e-mail and/or via the Telegram bot of the Service.

BlancVPN does not charge any surplus or commissions and does not perform currency conversions when selecting Stripe as the payment method.

If you are choosing a payment method other than Stripe, transactions are made on the side of BlancVPN's payment partners.

In the case of payments or subscription renewals through a partner, the final amount debited by the partner may include commissions at their discretion, and the conversion rate from the currency specified on the payment page to the debited currency may differ from the rate of the card issuer's payment system and/or the Central Bank of the country in which the current or subsequent debits are made.

You agree that when paying through a partner, the exact purchase or renewal price in the debited currency may change depending on the action/inaction of the partner regarding their commission and/or their conversion rate of the currency specified on the payment page and the debited currency, set independently on their discretion.

The exact cost in the debited currency can be clarified in support chat.

BlancVPN may change the subscription price when paying via Stripe, notifying you in advance by email or in Telegram one month before the subscription renewal date. To opt-out of renewing the subscription at the new price, cancel the auto-renewal in your Personal Account or the BlancVPN Telegram bot

We want your experience of using BlancVPN to be as positive as possible. If you encounter any problems, contact support by mail [\[email protected\]](https://blancvpn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or in Telegram [https://t.me/FCK\_RKN\_bot](https://t.me/FCK_RKN_bot). If you decide not to use our Services, we guarantee a refund within 30 days from the date of purchase of access to the Services.

You can take advantage of a guaranteed refund within 30 days from the date of purchase twice. If you have already used it for the first time, the next time you can request a refund only after 6 months from the date of the first refund.

If you purchased a subscription to access the Services through the AppStore, Google Play or other app store, we will not be able to provide you with a 30-day refund policy. Such subscriptions are subject to the refund policy of the AppStore, Google Play or other app store, depending on the app store used to purchase the subscription.

The refund of payments made in cryptocurrency is carried out in the same cryptocurrency in the amount equivalent to the subscription price in euros at the exchange rate on the day of the refund.

You can cancel your subscription to the Service at any time, but the funds for the unused subscription period will not be refunded – the Service will continue to work until the end of the paid period. We reserve the right to refuse a refund if the user violates the Terms of Use of BlancVPN, even if this led to the blocking of the account.

In some cases, depending on your location, we may add VAT, GST and other taxes or fees applicable to you at the time of purchase to the subscription price.
