    2. **Changes**. We reserve the right to change the terms or specifications of any Services in our discretion, with or without prior written notice to the Users, by replacement of text of this Agreement or description of paid subscription plans on the Website or by written notice to you. Any changes will take effect immediately unless otherwise stated in the notice of change. If any amendment is unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate relations with Pexgle. Your continued use of the Services following our notice of change will constitute a binding acceptance of the Agreement, as amended.

    4. **Right to Use Services**. Pexgle hereby grants you permission to use the Services and the Website solely as set forth in this Agreement and in the manner set forth on the Website. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Website, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. Any use of the Services other than as set forth in this Agreement or in violation of any term of this Agreement will result in suspension or revocation of your use privileges in our sole discretion.
    5. **Suspension or Termination of Services**. Notwithstanding anything stated or implied to the contrary in this Agreement, we may at any time, without derogating from our other rights under this Agreement, applicable law or otherwise, suspend or terminate any or all of the Services, effective immediately upon issuance of a written notice. Such suspension or termination may also apply, as the case may be, to specific jurisdictions, lines of business and otherwise or to a specific customer or a group of Users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely with respect to Users of paid Services, whenever reasonably possible, such Users may be given up to thirty (30) days after notice of suspension or termination of their User account to back-up the data stored in their account before it may be removed entirely from our servers.

We reserve the right to use third party service providers in the provisions of all or part of the Services including, but not limited to, hosting providers, payment processing services, information and communication services, analytics services, internet advertising platforms, advertising service providers and platforms.
