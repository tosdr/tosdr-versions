Our Mission & Values
--------------------

We believe everyone deserves their privacy, especially online. Privacy should not be contested, bartered, nor political, but rather a basic human right. Privacy Bee is on a mission to give consumers a voice, centralizing their privacy preferences and enforcing them using any privacy laws available. It's not fair to expect a consumer to manage their privacy preferences across thousands of different websites, with data brokers selling personal info to companies they've never even heard of, making it impossible to truly be in control. Privacy Bee is changing that. Read our [**Privacy Manifesto**](https://privacybee.com/manifesto).
