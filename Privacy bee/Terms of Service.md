Terms of Service
================

These Terms of Service and any terms expressly incorporated herein (these **_“Terms”_**) apply to any access to, or use of, any services made available by Privacy Bee, LLC (**_“Privacy Bee”_**, **_“we”_**, **_“us”_**, or **_“our”_**) using the website [https://privacybee.com](https://privacybee.com/) (the **_“Site”_**) and the Product Offerings, as further described in Section 2.1 below, provided by us (collectively, the **_“Services”_**). The terms “you”, “your”, and “yourself” refer to the individual user of the Services. Throughout these Terms, you and Privacy Bee may each be referred to as a **_“Party”_** or collectively, the **_“Parties”_**.

BY CLICKING THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON, BY CHECKING THE APPROPRIATE BOX TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR BY ACCESSING THE SERVICES, YOU: (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS; (B) REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF SOUND MIND AND OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT (18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER); AND (C) ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE TERMS.

**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT CLICK THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON OR CHECK ANY BOX TO ACCEPT IT, AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.**

#### 1\. Modification to These Terms.

We may modify these Terms by providing notice of such changes, such as by sending you an email, providing notice through the Services, or updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. By clicking on an “I Agree” button or checkbox presented with the modified Terms, or by continuing to access or use of the Services, you confirm your agreement to the modified Terms. If you do not agree to any modification to these Terms, you must stop using the Services. We encourage you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your access to, and use of, the Services. If you have any question regarding the use of the Site or Services, please contact us in accordance with Section 14.

#### 2\. Services.

**_2.1 General._** We have developed the Services to assist individuals who are California residents, as defined in Section 17014 of Title 18 of the California Code of Regulations (**_“Consumers”_**) exercise their rights proscribed to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq., and its implementing regulations (the **_“CCPA”_**). Specifically, Consumers may use us as their authorized agent to exercise their rights to (i) request to delete personal information we collected from you; and/or (ii) request to opt-out of sales of personal information, from a specific organization at our sole choosing (the **_“Product Offerings”_**). You acknowledge and agree that in order to carry out the Services, we may require that you provide us with notarized documents necessary to prove your identity, proof that you have authorized us to act on your behalf, or any other information required for the purpose of fulfilling your request to exercise the rights given to you under the CCPA. You acknowledge and agree that we provide no guarantee of results, and that the we attempt to exercise your rights on your behalf may not succeed for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the denial of necessary power of attorney rights to the Company. Further, you agree and acknowledge that any authorization or Power of Attorney granted to us to fulfill one or more of the Product Offerings shall be considered fulfilled and terminated, with respect to any specific organization, upon our submission of the necessary documents as required by the CCPA to the specific organization of our choosing. We reserve the right to withdraw from representation, to cancel or annul the Power of Attorney, or any authorizations related thereto, at any time, for any reason, and at our sole discretion. You understand that we will not receive any implied authorizations, responsibilities, or agree to any representations unless specifically agreed to in an executed instrument expressly indicating an engagement between you and our Company.

**_2.2 Restricted Locations._** You may not use the Services if you are not a Consumer. We retain the right to request additional information from you to verify your status as a Consumer and further controls to restrict your access to the Services if you are not a Consumer. You acknowledge and agree that you will comply with this Section 2.2, even if our methods to prevent your use of the Services are not effective or can be bypassed.

**_2.3 No Legal Representation._** We do not offer legal representation, nor do we offer any legal advice, legal opinions, recommendations, referrals, or counseling. The information provided by us along with the content on our Services related to legal matters is provided for your private use and does not constitute legal advice. We do not review any information you provide us for legal accuracy or sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide opinions about your selection of forms, or apply the law to the facts of your situation. If you need legal advice for a specific problem, you should consult with a licensed attorney. As we are not a law firm, please note that any communications between you and us may not be protected under the attorney-client privilege doctrine. To the extent we undertake limited authority as your authorized agent, our authority does not extend beyond the limited scope necessary for the fulfillment of the Services. Furthermore, we do not agree to any auxiliary, tangential, secondary, related, consequential, either direct or indirect, obligations, authorizations, or representations (**_“Related Work”_**), as they may stem from the fulfilment of the Services – nor is it our obligation to disclose, advise, or otherwise inform you of any required Related Work that you must fulfill, regardless of your legal obligation to fulfill the Related Work in order to maintain compliance with any laws related thereto, even if the origination of the requisite compliance stems from the Services provided to you by us. Furthermore, we do not maintain, and hereby expressly withdraw from, any ongoing representation and related obligations to you beyond the termination of our relationship in accordance with these Terms. You further agree and acknowledge that this Limited Power of Attorney will terminate automatically upon any legal actions taken by me, the Company, my authorized agent, or any third party (e.g., an organization to which a submission under the CCPA is being made) associated with the purpose with this Limited Power of Attorney.

#### 3\. Account.

**_3.1 Account Activation._** In order to use the Services, you must create and maintain an account through the Services (an “Account”). To create or maintain your Account, you will be required to provide us with certain information and documentation, including, as applicable, the information and documentation associated with identity verification and other screening procedures described in Section 2.2 (collectively referred to herein as the “documentation”). You will: (a) create a unique password; (b) provide complete and accurate information; (c) promptly update any information you have provided to us so that the information is complete and accurate at all times; (d) maintain the security of your Account by protecting your password from unauthorized access or use; (e) promptly notify us if you discover or suspect any unauthorized access or use of your Account or any security breaches related to your Account; and (f) be responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Account.

**_3.2 Account Responsibility._** You are responsible for keeping your Account and your password secure. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your Account, username, or password or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your Account so as not to provide third parties with your Account credentials. We will not be liable for any loss that you incur as a result of someone else accessing and using your Account, either with or without your knowledge.

**_3.3 Number of Accounts._** You agree that you will not create more than one Account or create an Account for anyone other than yourself.

By signing up for the Services, you expressly authorize us to withdraw funds from your bank account and/or charge your payment card (as applicable) for the full amount of the Fees. Since the Services are on-going and are subject to recurring payments, you expressly authorize us to withdraw funds from your bank account and/or charge your payment card on a recurring basis until you affirmatively cancel, remove or stop your use of the Services. You may be provided with the option to prepay Fees in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, in which event we may offer a discount or other incentive to you. All Fees paid by you for, via, or in connection with the Services are final and are non-refundable. You understand that the fees you pay to the Company for the Services are associated with the attempt to exercise your rights under the CCPA, and not for the guarantee of results associated therewith.

Our Mission & Values
--------------------

We believe everyone deserves their privacy, especially online. Privacy should not be contested, bartered, nor political, but rather a basic human right. Privacy Bee is on a mission to give consumers a voice, centralizing their privacy preferences and enforcing them using any privacy laws available. It's not fair to expect a consumer to manage their privacy preferences across thousands of different websites, with data brokers selling personal info to companies they've never even heard of, making it impossible to truly be in control. Privacy Bee is changing that. Read our [**Privacy Manifesto**](https://privacybee.com/manifesto).
