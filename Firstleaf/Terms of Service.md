Unless we expressly provide otherwise, all changes shall be effective immediately upon posting and/or upon notice to you by one of a variety of ways including, but not limited to, posting a notice on our Website or upon login, sending an e-mail to you at the address you provided, or by including a notice with any products you receive. In any event, no changes will apply retroactively as to any claims existing prior to the “Last Updated” date. If you do not agree with any of the changes, you must discontinue using any and all Firstleaf Services. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Services after the date on which the Terms have changed means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page each time you access the Website, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.
    2. Changes to Services. Firstleaf is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Firstleaf may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Firstleaf’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You also acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Firstleaf provides may change from time to time .

Firstleaf may update the content on its Websites from time to time, but its content is provided “as is” and is not necessarily complete or up to date, and Firstleaf does not make any commitment and is under no obligation to update Website content.
    3. Changes To Products. We may be required to change the terms of any products or other goods or subscriptions that we offer and/or you purchase. This includes without limitation changes to prices, taxes, shipping and handling amounts, specifications, delivery times, and/or package contents. All prices, discounts, and Promotions are subject to change without notice. Where required by applicable law, Firstleaf will provide you with notice of material changes related to your purchases. Firstleaf will not incur any obligation as a result of such change. You understand and agree that by continuing to accept products, goods and/or subscriptions and by agreeing to these Terms, you will be deemed to have accepted and agree to changes.
3. Firstleaf Products and Services; Refunds; Orders; General Information; Gift Cards; Referrals.
    1. Use of Firstleaf Services Notice. When ordering products, goods or subscriptions through our Website, or otherwise using the Firstleaf Services:
        1. Firstleaf reserves the right to not accept any orders if there is a material error in the description of the product or service, or if the price advertised is incorrect;
        2. Firstleaf reserves the right to refuse or discontinue the supply of any product or service to any customer, or change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of our Website at any time in our sole and absolute discretion;
        3. all prices are displayed in United States Dollars unless expressly indicated otherwise;
        4. when you place an order, we estimate the tax applicable to your order and include that estimate in the total for your convenience (the final tax amount will be based on the then-current rate as established by the applicable taxing authority, charged to your payment method, and reflected in the order confirmation we provide to you);
        5. all items are subject to availability, and if a product you ordered is not available at the time of sale, we will automatically replace the product with a product of equal value; and
        6. resale is strictly prohibited.
    2. Our Guarantee; Refunds and Replacements. Your satisfaction is guaranteed unless you violate these Terms and/or engage in any fraudulent behavior, including creating multiple Firstleaf accounts or abuse of the satisfaction guaranteed program. If you are not satisfied with the quality, flavor profile or taste of a wine you receive from us; email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.firstleaf.club/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) within 30 days of delivery and we may issue a store credit, if permitted under applicable law. Should you have a broken bottle or damaged delivery issue, email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.firstleaf.club/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) within 30 days of delivery. We will work with you in an attempt to resolve the issue, which may include issuance of store credit or a refund if permitted under applicable law. Once an order has been delivered, no refund or credit will be issued, outside the guarantee of satisfaction.
    3. Restocking Fees. After an order is processed, if the order is cancelled, refused or cannot be delivered, a $25 restocking fee will be administered. Orders typically are fulfilled and shipped up to 3 days after the order is processed.
    4. Order Processing. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order prior to delivery. Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include system or typographical errors, inaccuracies in product or pricing information or product availability, fairness among customers where supplies are limited, or problems identified by our service or compliance departments. We also may require additional verification or information before accepting an order. We will contact you if any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is cancelled by us after we have processed your payment but prior to delivery, we will refund your payment. Refunds may take 5-7 days to process.

By using the Services, including purchasing any products or services made available through the Website, you may be asked to supply certain information, including without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, date of birth and your shipping information.

In the case of e-mail, you must provide an accurate e-mail address that is registered to you. You are responsible for promptly updating your information with any changes, especially to keep your billing information current. You must promptly notify us if your payment method is cancelled (for example, for loss or theft). Changes to such information can be made through your Firstleaf account or by contacting our “Member Experience” team at 1-800-461-7203. To help keep your account current and prevent service interruption, you acknowledge Firstleaf may update your payment method on file when it is set to expire or based on updates it receives from the bank or payment service provider that issues your payment method. You agree that your placement of an electronic order on our Website is sufficient to satisfy any applicable Statute of Frauds, and no further writing is required. If you are accessing, using and/or purchasing any Firstleaf Services on behalf of a company, you represent you have sufficient authority to bind that company to these Terms. In connection with the purchase of any product or service, you represent that the products will be used only in a lawful manner.
    6. Title and Taxes. Firstleaf currently ships to the mainland United States (except for Rhode Island, Mississippi, and Utah), as well as Hawaii and Alaska. State and local taxes will be assessed according to the applicable jurisdiction where wines are shipped. Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of any products to the carrier. Additionally, consumers in Arkansas, Delaware and Maine elect to purchase Firstleaf wines in California. Title to and ownership of these wines passes from Firstleaf to you in California, and wines are delivered to you in California. California sales tax will be applied to these transactions, and wine will be stored on your behalf at our facility prior to pick up or fulfillment as further described below.
    7. Shipping; Fulfillment and Fees. For jurisdictions where Firstleaf ships wine, shipments are made via common carrier(s), such as FedEx or UPS, to a residential or business address. No shipments can be made to PO Boxes. Typical shipping time is two to nine days, but times may vary. Shipping charges may be added with each purchase. Additional shipping costs apply for shipments to Alaska and Hawaii. Shipping costs are subject to change. For transactions which take place in California for Arkansas and Delaware residents, you may make an appointment to pick up products at our location during our regular business hours or you may make independent delivery arrangements. We can be contacted at [\[email protected\]](https://www.firstleaf.club/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for assistance. Additionally, you may also elect to have your wine order fulfilled through a third-party shipper, and you agree to allow us to provide information regarding your designated shipping destination to the third-party for fulfillment. If the weather is too hot or too cold, we may delay shipment until conditions are more favorable. We will keep you notified if this happens. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments.
    8. Age Requirements. When placing your first order and creating an account you will also be required to enter the date of birth to verify that you are at least 21 years of age. Firstleaf will only deliver wines to individuals who are 21 years of age or older and have provided valid proof of identification upon delivery. In the event that you do not allow the common carrier to verify your age via visual inspection or ID scanning technology, the order will be returned to Firstleaf and you will incur a $25 restocking fee. Firstleaf contracts with common carrier(s) who must receive positive proof of age at time of delivery, and review and confirm identity and age on our behalf. You agree that you will provide evidence of your age as 21 or older at time of delivery.
    9. Gift Cards. You may purchase and/or redeem gift cards through the Website. You must create or have a valid account to redeem a gift card. Gift cards may be redeemed on the Website by entering the gift card code in the payment section of the checkout page. Redemption of a gift card will result in application of a credit to your account in the amount of the gift card balance, which will be applied to your transaction(s) until the gift card balance is used in its entirety. If a transaction exceeds your gift card balance, you must pay the remaining amount with another approved payment method. Gift cards cannot be reloaded, resold, transferred for value or redeemed for cash, and cannot be returned for a refund (except as required by law). No portion of the balance on your gift card may be transferred to another Firstleaf account. Firstleaf is not responsible for lost or stolen gift cards and lost or stolen gift cards cannot be replaced (except at Firstleaf's sole discretion or as required by law). Firstleaf reserves the right to refuse to honor a gift card where we suspect that the gift card was obtained fraudulently. Gift cards can not be purchased using Firstleaf store credit. Gift cards do not expire. We do not impose any activation, dormancy, or service fees.

    1. Disputes. The terms of this Section 9 shall apply to all Disputes between you and Firstleaf and/or any third party operating on Firstleaf's behalf (including but not limited to any employees, agents, affiliates, service providers, suppliers, or vendors). For the purposes of this Section, “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, controversy or action between you and Firstleaf in connection with any Services, these Terms, any subject matter related to the Services or Terms, including any other transaction involving you and Firstleaf, and further including any dispute, claim, controversy or action that arose before this or any prior agreement, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law. YOU AND FIRSTLEAF AGREE THAT “DISPUTE” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR FIRSTLEAF FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION. Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, shall decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.
    2. BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AND FIRSTLEAF AGREE: (I) TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS IN THESE TERMS; (II) THESE TERMS MEMORIALIZE A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE; (III) THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (9 U.S.C. § 1, ET SEQ.) GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS SECTION (NOTWITHSTANDING THE CHOICE-OF-LAW PROVISION CONTAINED HEREIN); AND (IV) THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.
    3. Dispute Notice. In the event of a Dispute, you or Firstleaf must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the “Dispute Notice”). The Dispute Notice to Firstleaf must be addressed to: 50 Technology Court, Napa, CA 94558 (the “Firstleaf Notice Address”). The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. If Firstleaf and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or Firstleaf may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each party agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.
    4. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state, municipality, province, or territory if the action is within that court's jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.
    5. Arbitration Procedure. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules or AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, as applicable, (the “AAA Rules”) available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/); except AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, provincial, territorial or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    6. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding. If either you or Firstleaf decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to initiate the arbitration in accordance with the AAA Rules. In accordance with the AAA Rules, the initiating party must (1) file or submit a “Demand for Arbitration” with the AAA, and (2) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties. The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
    7. Hearing Format. In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Firstleaf or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Firstleaf is entitled. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.
    8. Arbitration Fees. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's Rules. For claims under $10,000, Firstleaf will reimburse you for AAA issued fees, as well as the initial filing fee, if you are deemed the prevailing party by the arbitrator. You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.
    9. Opt-out. You may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in these Terms by sending a written letter to the Firstleaf Notice Address within thirty (30) days of your acceptance to these Terms (including your first purchase of any Firstleaf Service or use of the Website) that specifies: (i) your name; (ii) your mailing address; and (iii) your request to be excluded from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this Section. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other Terms shall continue to apply.
    10. Amendments to this Section. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and Firstleaf agree that if Firstleaf makes any material amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in these Terms, Firstleaf will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments by sending a written letter to the Firstleaf Notice Address that specifies: (i) your name; (ii) your mailing address; and (iii) your request to opt-out of such amendments. If you affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language in the current Terms, without any of the amendments governing. If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such amendments.
    11. Severability. If any provision in this Section 9 is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of this Section 9 shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.
    12. Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies. Firstleaf and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the courts located within the State of Delaware, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.
    13. **WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.** YOU AND FIRSTLEAF AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS SECTION, AN ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT COMBINE OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY'S CLAIMS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES TO AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, YOU AND FIRSTLEAF AGREE THAT NO DISPUTE SHALL PROCEED BY WAY OF CLASS ARBITRATION WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY PROMOTIONAL OFFER IS INTENDED TO BE A DISCOUNT OR REDUCTION ON THE TOTAL PRICE OF THE REQUIRED PURCHASE WHICH MAY RESULT IN A VALUE EQUAL TO ONE OR MORE OF THE ITEMS BEING PURCHASED. NO PROMOTIONAL OFFER IS INTENDED AS AN OFFERING OF FREE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.
11. Indemnification; Limitation of Liability.
    1. Indemnification. To the maximum extent not prohibited by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold Firstleaf Parties harmless from and against any claims, costs, proceedings, liabilities, actions, demands, losses, expenses, suits, or damages of any kind or nature (including attorneys' fees) made or incurred by any third party arising out of or relating to your (i) improper use of any Firstleaf Services, (ii) User Generated Content, (iii) violation of these Terms, (iv) violation of applicable law, or (v) violation of any rights of or obligations to a third party.
    2. DISCLAIMER OF COMMON LAW INDEMNITY RIGHTS. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO INDEMNITEE OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ANY FORM OF EQUITABLE OR IMPLIED INDEMNIFICATION AT ANY TIME IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ANY FIRSTLEAF SERVICES.
    3. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL FIRSTLEAF PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SPECIAL, COMPENSATORY, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES), LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, LOSS OF PRIVACY, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION OF GOOD FAITH OR OF REASONABLE CARE, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORESEEABILITY AND/OR IF WE WERE ADVISED OF SUCH DAMAGES OR OF ANY ADVICE OR NOTICE GIVEN TO FIRSTLEAF PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF ANY FIRSTLEAF SERVICES. THIS LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR FORM OF ACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF FIRSTLEAF PARTIES TO YOU UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT DAMAGES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU IN THE LAST NINETY (90) DAYS TO FIRSTLEAF FOR ANY FIRSTLEAF SERVICES. YOU AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN FIRSTLEAF AND YOU. THE FIRSTLEAF SERVICES WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. FIRSTLEAF WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM ANY OBLIGATION UNDER THESE TERMS IF SUCH FAILURE IS CAUSED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTERNET OUTAGES, COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, FIRE, FLOOD, NATURAL DISASTER, CIVIL UNREST OR WAR.  
          
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THE EXTENT YOU RESIDE WITHIN SUCH JURISDICTION.
12. Miscellaneous.
    1. Governing law. You agree that the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will exclusively govern these Terms and any Dispute between you and Firstleaf. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of Section 9 of these Terms.
    2. Geographic Restrictions. Our Website is controlled, operated, and administered in the United States. Firstleaf makes no representation or warranty that the Firstleaf Services are appropriate or available for use at locations outside of the United States, and access to them from territories where the contents or products available through the Services are illegal is prohibited. You may not use the Services or export any Services or products obtained through the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations. If you access the Firstleaf Services from a location outside of the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any and all local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances.
    3. Force Majeure. Under no circumstances shall Firstleaf be held responsible or liable for any delay or failure in our performance under these Terms or the Firstleaf Services resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, terrorism, epidemics, pandemics or other viral outbreaks, and/or war (including but not limited to cyber related events and/or occurrences attributed to state and/or quasi-state actors by either public or privacy organizations and/or entities and/or governmental bodies or organizations), governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat, lighting, or air conditioning.
    4. Notices. All notices required or permitted to be given under these Terms must be in writing. Firstleaf may provide you notice by sending you an e-mail to the address on file with us, which you agree electronically satisfies any legal requirement that such notice be in writing. YOU BEAR THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS ON FILE WITH FIRSTLEAF IS ACCURATE AND CURRENT, AND NOTICE TO YOU SHALL BE DEEMED EFFECTIVE UPON THE SENDING BY FIRSTLEAF OF AN E-MAIL TO THAT ADDRESS. You shall give any notice to Firstleaf by means of U.S. mail, postage prepaid, to 50 Technology Court, Napa, CA 94558, Attn: Compliance Department. Such notice to Firstleaf shall be effective upon receipt of notice by Firstleaf.
    5. Severability. If any provision of these Terms (except for Section 9), or a part thereof, shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision or part thereof shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions or parts thereof.
    6. Suspension Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, Firstleaf may, in its sole and absolute discretion, suspend, disable, block, or terminate your access and use of any Firstleaf Services (including without limitation, deleting your account(s) or any part thereof), or block, remove or delete any User Generated Content that you submitted, for any lawful reason, including if Firstleaf determines in its discretion that you violated these Terms (such as and including by way of example, to the extent your conduct or User Generated Content violates these Terms or could damage Firstleaf's reputation or goodwill). If Firstleaf suspends, disables, blocks, terminates, or deletes your account, you may not re-register for or use the Firstleaf Services under any other login or account profile. Firstleaf may block your access to the Firstleaf Services to prevent re-registration. You agree that Firstleaf will not be liable for any interruption or termination of your access and/or use of the Firstleaf Services.
    7. Third Party Beneficiaries. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you. You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Firstleaf.com is affiliated shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.
    8. Survival. The provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall survive such termination.
    9. No Waivers. No waiver of any provision of these Terms by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing signed by an officer or executive of Firstleaf.com in order to be effective.
    10. Assignment. Firstleaf may assign these Terms to any person or entity at any time, for any reason, with or without notice to you.
    11. Headings Interpretation. The headings of the sections and subsections contained in these Terms are included for reference purposes only, solely for the convenience of the parties, and shall not in any way be deemed to affect the meaning, interpretation or applicability of these Terms or provision hereof. When the context requires, the plural shall include the singular and the singular the plural; and any gender shall include any other gender. All references to “including” or “includes” or any variation thereof shall be deemed to include the terms “without limitation”. The words “hereunder,” “hereof,” “hereto” and words of similar import shall be deemed references to these Terms as a whole. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, these Terms shall not be construed against the party who drafted these Terms.
    12. Amendments Entire Agreement. The Terms, as amended from time to time, constitute the entire legal agreement between you and Firstleaf and govern your use of the Services (excluding any services which Firstleaf may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace and supersede all agreements, communications and course of dealings between you and Firstleaf.
