1. ### The Information We Collect
    
    The Site collects information from You when You use it. Some of this information may be considered "personal information" under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies You as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as Your name and email address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as "personal information" where required by applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code ("hash"). We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification process satisfies legal requirements. We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.Â 
    
    We collect information when You visit or interact with the Site, including:
    
    **Information You Submit.** The information You submit to us will depend on how You engage with us. For instance, if You create an account with us, You will need to provide Your contact information (Your name and email address) and a password; if you are using the Site to share information publicly such as your custom lists, or to identify your favorite series or movies, you will need to provide information about those preferences and interests and if You are subscribing to receive the TVDB API, You will need to provide payment information. You may also upload entertainment related and other content to the Site, and we may ask for additional information either through the Site or through surveys, such as demographic data, Your experience with the Site, or information about Your opinions, interests and preferences.
    
    **Information We Collect Automatically.** The Site collects certain information whenever You visit it or otherwise interact with it ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser, and operating system You are using, the URL or advertisement that referred You to the webpage You are visiting, all of the areas within the Site that You visit, Your time zone, and mobile network (if applicable), among other information. In addition, we automatically collect Your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device You use to access our Site. We may be able to collect or infer Your approximate location based on Your IP address or similar information we collect. As You use the Site, we may also track how You interact with our content.
    
    The methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:
    
    **Cookies and Local Storage** small text files stored locally on Your device that help store user preferences. These technologies are able to store a unique identifier for a device to us to recognize the device whenever the device is used to visit the Site. These technologies may be used for many purposes by us, our service providers, and our third-party business partners, such as automatically collecting Usage Information, enabling features, serving advertisements to You on our Site, and remembering Your preferences. We may use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on the Site, to study the effectiveness of our customer communications, and to personalize Your experience through the Site, such as to recognize You when You return to them. The information we store includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. If You do not want to accept cookies, You can block them by adjusting the settings on Your Internet browser. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
    
    **Web beacons (also known as clear GIFs and pixel tags)** are small pieces of code used to collect usage analytics. They help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When You ask us to send You information or a promotion or a newsletter, we will use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.
    
    We use similar tools to collect such information from mobile devices. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.
    
    **Social Media Platforms**. TheTVDB.com permits You to interact with social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter. When You interact with third party platforms through the Site, we will receive information about You. We may also receive information about You if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and You are one of their connections or "friends." The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and Your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. We or the third party may allow You to disable or remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about You through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.
    
    If You choose to post information to a third party platform, that information may be public and the third party may have access to information about You and Your use of the Site. You may also choose to participate in a way that connects that third-party service with our Site, such as posting to one of our pages on a social media site. Doing so may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about You, including personal information, and the third party may allow us to re-post content related to us on our own services.
    
    In addition, these third parties may set their own cookies and collect information about Your use of TheTVDB.com, including Your IP address or other device identifiers, and which pages You visit on our Site. Certain third party platforms may be able to collect certain information on Your visits to TheTVDB.com regardless of whether or not You affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not You are logged into (or have) an account.
    
2. ### How We Use Your Information
    
    We may use non-personal information for any purpose. We also use information that we collect, including personal information and Usage Information, to: (1) provide the services You request and allow You to participate in features we offer, or to provide related customer service; (2) to process Your subscription order; (3) to tailor content, recommendations, and offers we display to You on TheTVDB.com; (4) recognize You across our Site; (5) process Your requests, questions, or feedback, including to provide You with technical support; (6) provide You with information, products, or services that You have requested or that we think may interest You; (7) investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities or activities that violate our policies, which may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities; (8) process Your registration, including verifying Your information is active and valid; (9) improve the Site and for internal business purposes; (10) contact You with regard to Your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to the Site's policies; and (11) for purposes disclosed at the time You provide Your personal information or otherwise with Your consent.
    
3. ### How We Share Your Information
    
    We may share non-personal information, such as aggregated statistics or de-identified data, for any purpose in our discretion. We do not share Your personal information with third parties for those third parties' own direct marketing purposes unless we provide You the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out prior to such sharing. In addition, we may share the information we have collected about You, including personal information and Usage Information, as disclosed at the time You provide us with Your information or with Your consent, and as described in this Privacy Policy, including as set forth below.

    2. **Service Providers.** We contract with certain companies to perform services on our behalf, including advertising, marketing assistance, e-mail delivery, hosting services, site maintenance and repair, security, quality assurance, customer service, surveys, and data research and analysis, and provide Your information to them in furtherance of such services.

By providing Your personal information, You agree that we may transfer such information to the other entity in such a transaction without Your further consent.
    4. **For Administrative and Legal Reasons.** We reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the integrity of the Site; to fulfill Your requests; to cooperate in a law enforcement investigation, an investigation on a public safety matter, or an investigation into claims of intellectual property infringement; to protect and defend the legal rights and/or property of WNI and any of our subsidiaries, affiliates, and shareholders, or the Site, any of their users, or any other party; or, in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of users or the general public.

16. ### Notice to California Residents
    
    **This California Privacy Notice is effective as of January 3, 2024.**
    
    This notice supplements the TVDB Privacy Policy. Terms (including defined capitalized terms) used in this California Privacy Notice have the same meanings given in the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2023, and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder (collectively, the "CCPA"), unless otherwise defined.
    
    * **Exercising Your Rights**
        
        The CCPA provides California users with the right to request (1) that we disclose to You what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to You the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about You ("**Right to Know**"); and (2) that we delete the Personal Information we collected about You ("**Right to Delete**"), (3) that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you ("**Right** **to** **Correct**"), (4) to opt-out from the sharing of your Personal Information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising) ("**Right to Opt-Out of Sharing**"), (5) to opt-out from the sale of their Personal Information ("**Right to Opt-Out of Sale**"), and (6) that we limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) to purposes set forth under the CCPA, including what is necessary and anticipated to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services ("**Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of SPI**"), all subject to meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA. More information on how to exercise these rights is below.
        
        Please note that our business activities do not use personal information in a manner that triggers the Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of SPI.
        
        California users have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA rights. We will not discriminate against You for exercising Your CCPA rights.
        
    * **Verifying Requests**
        
        Please note that we will take reasonable steps to verify Your identity in order to fulfill Your request. In addition to Your user name and email address, we may ask for additional information, such as Your transactions with us (e.g., a series or movie You have marked as a favorite).
        
        In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request. When you exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, and/or Right to Correct, we may ask that you provide us with information, beyond the above, in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request.
        
    * **Agents**
        
        If You are an authorized representative submitting a request on a user's behalf, please submit the request per the instructions below We will follow up to request a signed, written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing You to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state Your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request and needs to be clear about the permission granted.
        
        Alternatively, You may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in Your email the nature of Your request. The consumer's identity, in addition to Your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill Your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided You permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that You are authorized to act on the consumer's behalf, we may deny the request. If You have questions about any of these rights, please contact us at [legal@whipmedia.com](mailto:legal@whipmedia.com).
        
    * **Submitting Your Requests**
        
        If You are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your rights please email us at legal@whipmedia.com or mail us Your request at Whip Networks, Inc., 1841 Centinela Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404. Your request must include Your user name (if you have one) and email address; please also include any additional information that You have submitted to us that may help us verify You as set forth below.
        
    * **Other Important Information**
        
        Requests to Know: In order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that You are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
        
        Requests to Delete: To ensure that we do not delete Your personal information in response to a fraudulent request, once You submit the request, we may follow up to confirm that You want Your information to be deleted.
        
        Do Not Sell or Share for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising: As required under CCPA, WNI provides a right to California users of the Site to request to opt-out of the sale and sharing of Personal Information (i.e., for targeted advertising). WNI does not sell personal information for monetary compensation, but as described above, certain third-party advertising partners and analytics companies may collect data from visitors to the Site, and these may be considered "sales" or "sharing" under the CCPA. Click here (Cookies Settings) to manage your cookie preferences for the Site.

    * **Do Not Track**
        
        Some browsers incorporate a 'Do Not Track' (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them.

    * **Other California Rights for Non-Business Users**
        
        California residents who provide companies conducting business in California with information primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, have the right to request certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as WNI does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. WNI will provide You choice prior to sharing Your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If You do not opt-in or if You choose to opt-out at the time WNI offers that choice, we will not share Your personal information with that third party for its direct marketing purposes.
        
        California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing legal@whipmedia.com or writing to us at Whip Networks, Inc., 1841 Centinela Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404. You must put the statement "Your TVDB California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of Your email or in the address line of Your envelope. You must include Your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
