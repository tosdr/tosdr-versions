Summary
-------

When you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, we or our authorized service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies for storing information to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience and for advertising purposes.

This page is designed to help you understand more about these technologies and our use of them on our sites and in our services, applications, and tools. Below is a summary of a few key things you should know about our use of such technologies. You can review the contents of our full [User Cookie Notice](#user-cookie-notice) below.

Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. They are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant and targeted ads. We use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent).You are free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device permits so. You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.

Where possible, security measures are set in place to prevent unauthorized access to our cookies and similar technologies. A unique identifier ensures that only we and/or our authorized service providers have access to cookie data.

Service providers are companies that help us with various aspects of our business, such as site operations, services, applications, advertisements and tools. We use some authorized service providers to help us to serve you relevant ads on our services and other places on the internet. These service providers may also place cookies on your device via our services (third party cookies). They may also collect information that helps them identify your device, such as IP-address or other unique or device identifiers.

What are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?
--------------------------------------------------------

Like most sites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "device") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.

The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers, and similar technologies we use to collect information (e.g. about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take on our Services, within our advertising or e-mail content) may change from time to time. In order to help you better understand this Policy and our use of such technologies we have provided the following limited terminology and definitions:

* Cookies\- Small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. Cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. There are several types of cookies:
    * Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session.
    * Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.
    * First-party cookies are set by the site you are visiting.
    * Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting.
* Cookies can be disabled or removed by tools that are available in most commercial browsers. The preferences for each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options.
* Web beacons \- Small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that may be included on our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.
* Similar technologies\- Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.

We may use the terms "cookies" or "similar technologies" interchangeably in our policies to refer to all technologies that we may use to store data in your browser or device or that collect information or help us identify you in the manner described above.

Your choice and our use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We offer certain site features, services, applications, and tools that are available only through the use of these technologies. You are always free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your browser, installed application, or device so permits. However, if you decline cookies or other similar technologies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain site features, services, applications, or tools. You may also be required to re-enter your password more frequently during your browsing session. For more information on how you can block, delete, or disable these technologies, please review your browser or device settings.

Generally, these technologies allow our sites, services, applications, and tools to store relevant information in your browser or device and later read that information in order to identify you to our servers or internal systems. Where applicable, we protect our cookies and other similar technologies to help ensure that only we and/or our authorized service providers can interpret them by assigning them a unique identifier that is designed for interpretation only by us. We do not store any of your personal information on any of our cookies or other similar technologies.

Any personal information that we collect and store through use of these technologies is first obtained through notice and consent: We obtain your consent by providing you with transparent notice of use of the technologies and, to the extent described herein, providing you with the opportunity to make a choice to disable these technologies.

Our uses of such technologies fall into the following general categories:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Operationally Necessary. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our sites, services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our sites, services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;
2. Performance Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our websites, applications, services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our websites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, services, or tools;
3. Functionality Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our sites, services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our sites;
4. Advertising or Targeting Related. We may use first-party or third-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our sites or on third party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.

  

We offer you the ability to opt-out of our use of first-party advertising-related cookies through our [Ad Choice program](https://pages.ebay.com/help/account/adchoice.html). To opt-out of the use of third-party advertising-related cookies and web beacons, see the section [Ad Networks and Exchanges authorized by third-parties](https://pages.ebay.com/help/account/cookies-web-beacons.html) below. Opting out of our first-party advertising-related cookies, or out of third-party advertising-related cookies and web beacons as described below, does not necessarily mean that you will not see our advertising - only that this advertising will not be targeted to you through the use of first-party or third-party cookies, web beacons or related technologies.

If you would like to opt-out of all other types of technologies we employ on our sites, services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.

Use of these technologies by authorized third-party service providers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We may work with third-party companies, commonly known as service providers, who are authorized to place third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies for storing information on our sites or in our services, applications, and tools with our permission. These service providers help us to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience.

These service providers may use these technologies to help us deliver content and advertising, and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions on their use or collection of any personal information.

The following applies to users in the European Economic Area (EEA): To the extent that we are solely responsible for the processing of your personal data (including the transmission of such data to Facebook) in accordance with the Facebook Terms (i.e., when Facebook provides comparison, measurement and analysis services to us), Facebook exclusively acts on our account on the basis of an applicable processing agreement (so called Data Processing Terms in addition to the Facebook EU Data Transfer Addendum). However, if we and Facebook assume shared responsibility for the collection and transmission of your personal data to Facebook (i.e., specifically for the processing of data about your usage of our services for the purpose of targeting our advertisements, the improvement and the measurement of the effectiveness of our advertisements), Facebook will subsequently process the data as an independently accountable party and assumes exclusive responsibility.

We have entered into an Agreement about Shared Responsibilities with Facebook in order to determine the mutual responsibilities for the fulfilment of data privacy obligations with regards to the shared processing. Pursuant to this agreement, it is Facebook's responsibility to safeguard the rights of the affected persons with regards to the personal data stored by Facebook under the mutual agreement.

These data transmissions enable us to display personalised advertisements for you in our own online listings as well as in online listings of third parties via the advertising products and the marketing platforms of Google (Google advertising products, such as Google Ad Manager, Google Ads), and to measure their effectiveness, to select and provide content, to provide reports about such content and to gain insights into target groups and product developments. You can find additional information in the Google Privacy Policy and an explanation of the data privacy obligations in the Google Ads Data Protection Terms: Service Information

With the exception of the use of such technologies by our service providers or other authorized third-parties, we do not permit any third-party content on sites (such as item listings, member-to-member communications, classified listings, comments, reviews, etc.) to include or utilize any cookies, web beacons, local storage, or similar technologies for tracking purposes or to collect your personal information for their own purposes. If you believe a listing or other third-party content might be collecting personal information or using tracking technologies on one of our sites, please report it to [dpo@gumtree.com](mailto:dpo@gumtree.com).

**TikTok**: We may transmit information about your usage of our services, including additional personal data about you (as described in detail in the advertisement settings), through TikTok Pixel and by sending data directly to TikTok via our servers. 'TikTok' designates TikTok Information Technologies UK Ltd, Kaleidoscope, 4 Lindsey Street, Barbican, London, EC1A 9HP, United Kingdom, for users in the UK.

These data transmissions enable us to display personalised advertisements for you on TikTok's platforms, to measure their effectiveness and to report on them.

The following applies to users in the UK: To the extent that we are solely responsible for the processing of your personal data (including the transmission of such data to TikTok) in accordance with the TikTok Terms (i.e. when TikTok provides comparison, measurement and analysis services to us), TikTok exclusively acts on our account on the basis of an applicable processing agreement. However, if we and TikTok assume shared responsibility for the collection and transmission of your personal data to TikTok (i.e. specifically for the processing of data about your usage of our services for the purpose of targeting our advertisements, the improvement and the measurement of the effectiveness of our advertisements), TikTok will subsequently process the data as an independently accountable party and assumes exclusive responsibility.

These third-party ad networks and exchange providers may use third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information. They may also collect your device identifier, IP address, or identifier for advertising (IDFA).
