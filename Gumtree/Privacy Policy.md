#### What is Personal Information?

Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.

We collect personal information from you when you use our Services.

We collect personal information from you and any devices (including mobile devices) you use when you: use our Services, register for an account with us, provide us information on a web form, update or add information to your account, participate in community discussions, chats, or dispute resolution or when you otherwise correspond with us.

Some of this personal information, such as a way to identify you, is necessary to enter into our [Terms of Use](https://www.gumtree.com/termsofuse). The provision of all other personal information is voluntary, but may be necessary in order to use our Services, such as the offer details or contact information needed to post an ad.

We may also collect personal information from other sources, as described below.

* Identifying information such as your name, addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses when you register for an account with us.

* **Social Media.** We allow you to share information with social media sites, or use social media sites to create your account or to connect your account with the respective social media site.

You control the personal information you allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on the applicable social media site and the permissions you give us when you grant us access to the personal information retained by the respective social media site about you.

How long we keep your personal information
------------------------------------------

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our policies.

Our specific retention times for personal information are documented in our records retention schedules. How long we retain personal information can vary significantly based on context of the Services we provide and on our legal obligations. The following factors typically influence retention periods:

* _How long is the personal information needed to provide our Services?_ This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most of our data retention periods.
* _Is the personal information sensitive?_ If so, a shortened retention time is generally appropriate.
* _Have you provided consent for a longer retention period?_ If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.
* _Are we subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain your personal information?_ Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or personal information retained for the purposes of litigation.

After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your personal information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies.

Other important Privacy Information
-----------------------------------

This section describes some additional privacy information related to your use of our Services that you may find important.

#### When you share your personal information on our sites or applications – what happens?

Other users have access to the information you share on Gumtree. For example, other users can see your ratings, reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.

When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public Gumtree activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. If you associate your name with your user ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name may then be able to identify your Gumtree activities.

#### Your responsibilities over information you receive on Gumtree

When you correspond with another user and receive personal information of the other user (such as their name, email address, contact details, shipping and billing address) you are, independent from us, the controller of such data and you must comply with the applicable privacy laws.

You may use the personal information that you have access to only for Gumtree transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through Gumtree (such as fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our [Terms of Use](https://www.gumtree.com/termsofuse).

#### Unwanted or threatening email

We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and text messages is against our [Terms of Use](https://www.gumtree.com/termsofuse). To report Gumtree-related spam or spoof emails please notify us [here](https://help.gumtree.com/s/contactsupport).

#### Communication tools

We may scan messages automatically and check for spam, viruses, phishing and other malicious activity, illegal or prohibited content or violations of our Terms of Use, this privacy notice or our other policies.

#### Children's Privacy

Our websites are general audience websites and not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users deemed to be children under their respective national laws.

#### Third Party Privacy Practices

This privacy notice addresses only our use and handling of personal information we collect from you in connection with providing you our Services. If you disclose your information to a third party, or visit a third party website via a link from our Services, their privacy notices and practices will apply to any personal information you provide to them or they collect from you.

We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your personal information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your personal information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our site.
