responsible for delivery date changes from suppliers, including those based on supply  
chain shortages/interruptions.

**Storage Fees**  
At the customer request, Unbound Solar will hold shipment of a purchased Unbound Solar  
designed system without storage fees, for up to 30 days. At the end of the 30-day period, the order will be automatically scheduled to ship in 10 business days unless the customer advises Unbound Solar Customer Support of the following:

refund will be issued to the customer per the LIVE UNBOUND™ Promise.

**2\. Permit rejected, customer requests to cancel order within 30 days of order**

system to meet permitting requirements and cancels the order, a refund will be  
issued less a 5% restocking fee.

**3\. Permit delayed beyond 30 or issued but customer not yet ready to receive material.**

cannot arrange to receive the shipment, Unbound Solar will store the material for a  
flat fee of $500 starting on the scheduled shipment date. All storage fees must be  
paid in advance. At the end of the 30 days the order will be shipped.

**4\. Permit issued, Customer requests to cancel the order.** The customer will be  
refunded less 5% restocking.

**5\. Customer requests order cancellation for any reason other than specified above;**  
refund will be issued less 5% cancellation fee.

**Back Orders**  
Any items that are unavailable will be placed on back order, and the remainder of your  
order will be shipped per the ship date in the order confirmation. Estimated ship dates for  
backordered items will be provided. However, please note that these dates are “estimates”  
based on manufacturer information and not guaranteed to arrive on that date.

**Order Status**  
Unbound Solar will make all possible efforts to keep you informed of your order via e-mail.  
Your tracking number will be emailed to you once the item is shipped. Please check your  
spam folders and approve Unbound Solar as a trusted sender.

**Change Orders**  
You may change your order, provided that your order has not yet been processed and  
shipped. If items have shipped, then a restocking fee of 15% will apply on unneeded items  
due to customer requested changes. Please contact your Customer Support  
Representative directly with any changes and have your order number available.

**Shipping Policy**  
Unbound Solar and Unbound Solar vendors carefully inspect all shipments. Customers  
must inspect their shipments upon delivery, prior to signing the release, and document  
any discrepancies or damage to the shipment on the freight carrier delivery note.  
Customers who will not be signing for their order when it is delivered are responsible to  
see that the person signing has read and understands Unbound Solar’s Terms and  
Conditions. Unbound Solar is not responsible for delays due to carrier exceptions.

**Important**  
You or your receiving agent MUST check your order upon receipt for accuracy and possible  
concealed damage and notify Unbound of any discrepancies within 24 hours.  
Undiscovered damage claims not noted on the delivery receipt cannot be made with a  
carrier or Unbound Solar. NO EXCEPTIONS! When shipped, Unbound Solar ensures proper  
packaging and takes pictures of each outbound shipment. Protect your investment! It is  
your responsibility to check your shipment. Your signature on a shipping receipt is a legal  
release of claim for damage unless noted within 24 hours of receipt.

An independent shipping contractor such as UPS, FedEx or a commercial trucking  
company will deliver the order. When the shipment arrives, the driver will ask you to sign  
for the delivery. This is a legal document stating that the package is being delivered in  
good condition without damage and that the customer is waiving any additional claim from  
the shipper. Before signing, inspect the package(s) closely on all six sides. Note any box  
damage including scuffs, dents, tears, punctures or creases on the delivery receipt. If  
there is anything unusual with the package, the customer has the right to open it to  
inspect the contents. If the driver is unwilling to wait while you inspect all of the items, you  
may mark on the delivery receipt “Concealed Damage Possible”.

If there is damage to the shipment, you must choose to accept the shipment with damage  
noted/documented or refuse the package and contact Unbound Solar immediately.

**Cancellation Policy**  
To cancel your order, contact Customer Support during normal business hours. Provided  
your order has not yet been processed, and your payment has not been processed, no fees  
will be applied. Processed orders will have a 5% cancellation fee deducted from your  
refund within the first 30 days. If any portion of your order has shipped, a 15% restocking  
fee will be deducted from your refund. The refund will occur within 5 business days of  
receipt of the cancellation or the return of all shipped products.

Some products offered by Unbound Solar are custom built or special ordered. These items  
include but are not limited to: power centers, battery enclosures, and custom racking  
systems. Cancellation of these items will result in a cancellation fee, even if the item has  
not shipped. The cancellation fee will vary depending on the manufacturer. Certain  
products, such as Outback Power Pre-Wired Power Stations, are non-refundable, due to  
the manufacturer cancellation fees. If a discount was applied to an order for a nonrefundable product, the discount amount will be deducted from the refund. For example, if your order included a free shipping discount, the shipping fees would be  
deducted from the refundable amount.

**Return Policy**  
Merchandise, except for products identified as non-refundable, may be returned within 30  
days of the receipt of the product. Returns are subject to a standard restocking fee of  
15%. Prior to returning items, it is necessary to obtain an RMA # (Return Merchandise  
Authorization Number) for your return. Contact Customer service to request an RMA. Once  
you have received your RMA # and return instructions, you are responsible for shipping,

**Warranty Policy**  
The majority of products sold by Unbound Solar are not manufactured by Unbound Solar.  
All products are covered by the original manufacturer’s warranty, service, or support policy  
(if applicable). If a technical issue occurs with your product upon receipt or installation, we  
urge you to contact the manufacturer directly. The Customer shall be responsible for the  
return of any defective product and agrees to use only reputable carriers capable of  
providing proof of delivery and insurance for the value of the shipment.

Unbound Solar bears no responsibility in sending a replacement item to the Customer in  
the event that they have received a defective product. If you receive a defective unit,  
contact the manufacturer and they will typically repair or replace the product.

**Product Listings**  
Unbound Solar product & service descriptions are not designed or intended to replace  
your personal product knowledge, experience and/or research or that of a professional  
installer or licensed electrician.

Unbound Solar strives to be as accurate as possible in our product & service descriptions,  
compatibility references, information content, pricing, links and any other product  
information contained in or referenced on our site. However, occasional human error may  
occur, and we therefore cannot guarantee that all product descriptions, specifications,  
pricing, or any other content on the site is entirely accurate, complete, current, or that we  
are ultimately responsible for these errors. In the event that a product is listed at an  
incorrect price due to typographical, informational, technical, or any other error, Unbound  
Solar at its sole discretion, shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order for that  
product and immediately amend, correct or remove the inaccurate information. Moreover,  
all links on Unbound Solar’s website are intended only to provide visitors with assistance in  
finding additional information and professional opinion; however, due to the fast pace of  
the industry, complex nature and personal subjective experiences, reviews can become  
outdated or less accurate over time or even at inception and should therefore never be the  
sole determinate in a purchasing decision, or, most importantly, a substitute for doing  
one’s own product research. Please remember to consider, you, our valued patron, are  
ultimately responsible for any purchase decision.

completed. You will be asked to provide your credit card information with each new order.

**Privacy**

Unbound Solar to sign appropriate documents on Customer’s behalf to permit Unbound  
Solar to protect its purchase money security interest. Unbound Solar will advise Customer  
of estimated shipping dates, but Unbound Solar will, under no circumstances, be  
responsible for delays in delivery, and associated damages, due to events beyond its  
reasonable control, including without limitation: acts of God or public enemy, acts of  
federal, state or local government, fire, floods, civil disobedience, strikes, lockouts, and  
freight embargoes.

**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**  
Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions or the sales  
transaction between Unbound Solar and Customer shall be governed by the laws of the  
State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law rules. Specifically, the United  
Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not govern the validity,  
interpretation, and performance of this agreement. Unbound Solar and Customer consent  
to the exclusive jurisdiction and the venue of the State Courts of the State of California,  
Siskiyou County, to resolve any dispute between them related hereto, and the parities  
waive all rights to contest this exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such Courts. Finally, the  
Customer also agrees not to bring any legal action, based upon any legal theory including  
contract, tort, equity or otherwise, against Unbound Solar that is more than one year after  
the date of the applicable invoice.

**Severability**  
If any provision contained in this agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal, or unenforceable  
in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the  
remaining provisions and portions of this agreement, and the invalid, illegal, or  
unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified so as to have the most similar result  
that is valid and enforceable under applicable California law.

**Waiver**  
The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of  
this agreement shall not affect in any way the first party’s right to require such  
performance at any time thereafter. Any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision  
in this agreement shall not be taken or held by the other party to be a continuing waiver of  
that provision unless such waiver is made in writing.

**Entire Agreement**  
These terms and conditions, together with Unbound Solar’s invoice respecting the  
products ordered by Customer, are the complete and exclusive agreement between  
Unbound Solar and Customer, and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous proposals,  
oral or written, understandings, representations, conditions, warranties, and all other  
communications between Unbound Solar and Customer relating to the subject products.  
This agreement may not be explained or supplemented by any prior course of dealings or  
trade by custom or usage.
