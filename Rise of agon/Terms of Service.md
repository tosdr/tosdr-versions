If any provision in these TOS or the EULA is determined to be unenforceable in equity because of its scope, duration, geographical area, or other factor, then the court making that determination will have the power to reduce or limit such scope, duration, area, or other factor, and such provision will then be enforceable in its reduced or limited form.
