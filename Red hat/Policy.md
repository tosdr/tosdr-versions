General Terms and Conditions
----------------------------

**Master Agreement:** All terms and conditions of your master agreement with Red Hat that governs your purchase of Training (for instance the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement available at [https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements "Red Hat Enterprise Agreement")) and Red Hat’s Appendix 2A: Training and Training Units, apply to the purchase and consumption of Red Hat Training, in addition to the policies herein (these **"Policies"**). Capitalized terms that are used in these Policies but are not defined have the meanings given to those terms in your master agreement and Red Hat’s Appendix 2A.

**Modifications and Updates to the Training Policies:** Red Hat reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or update these Policies either by posting a revised version of these Policies at [https://www.redhat.com/en/about/red-hat-training-policies](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/red-hat-training-policies "Red Hat Training Policies") or by providing notice by other reasonable means. If you do not agree to the modified or updated Policies, then (a) the existing Policies will continue to apply to the Training you purchased as of the date of the modification or update for the remainder of the then-current Training term(s), and (b) the updated Policies will apply to any new purchases or renewals of Training made after the effective date of the updated Policies.

**Cancellation and Rescheduling of Classes by Red Hat:** Red Hat may cancel or reschedule a class, including a component of a Bundle, at its discretion. In the event of such cancellation, Red Hat will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice of such cancellation fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the class start date. Client will not be charged for the Red Hat cancellation or rescheduling. Red Hat is not liable for expenses incurred for Client’s travel expenses or hotel accommodations in the event that Red Hat cancels or reschedules an event.

**Requirements:** Client is responsible for ensuring it meets the requirements of the event in which it is enrolling. Red Hat offers skills assessments that help guide Client in enrolling in the proper course for their background. Additionally, Client can contact its local Red Hat Training sales representative for further guidance.

**Right of Dismissal:** In order to maintain a classroom environment that is conducive to learning, Red Hat reserves the right to dismiss a participant from any Red Hat training or exam event. A participant who harasses other participant(s) or instructor(s), or who in Red Hat's sole judgment acts inappropriately or disruptively during class, may be dismissed from the event and may not return to the premises. In case of such dismissal, Red Hat’s liability will be limited to the refunding of fees paid by Client for the course or exam, and Red Hat shall not be responsible for any consequential loss or inconvenience arising whatsoever.

**Special Accommodations Policy:**Red Hat may make special accommodations, on a case-by-case basis, for open enrollment classroom students, classroom exam candidates and Red Hat Individual Exam candidates, who have special needs. Participants with special needs should notify Red Hat of such needs a minimum of two weeks prior to their desired class/exam by filling out a Special Accommodations Request (SAR) form. In the case of special needs of a medical nature, a participant must have their medical/rehabilitation professional fill out a [Special Accommodations Request (SAR) form](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/special-accommodations-request-sar-form). Such form should be faxed back to the indicated fax number on the form. Red Hat will review the request and contact Named Participant about it.

**Privacy Statement:** Unless terms of the applicable master agreement state otherwise, any personal data collected or created as part of your participation in Red Hat training, or an exam event, or via our chat feature or other training resources will be used by Red Hat and its affiliates and subsidiaries for legitimate business purposes in accordance with its [Privacy Statement](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-policy?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001D8QoAAK "Privacy Statement"). As detailed in the Privacy Statement, Red Hat may use your personal data to fulfill your request and to provide you with the products, services, support and customer service. Red Hat may share your information with service providers that provide services related to the Red Hat training and exam event. Providing your information to Red Hat may involve transferring it to another country. You can read more about how Red Hat collects, uses and discloses personal data, your rights and choices, the transfer of personal data and other privacy practices of Red Hat when you read Red Hat’s [Privacy Statement](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-policy?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001D8QoAAK "Privacy Statement"). Specifically with regard to Named Participants taking a Red Hat Individual Exam, the section [Individual Exam Monitoring](#monitoring) contains more detailed information on the personal data Red Hat processes and how Red Hat processes such personal data as part of the Red Hat Individual Exam event.

**Minors Policy:** In accordance with [Red Hat’s Privacy Statement](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-policy?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001D8QoAAK "Red Hat's Privacy Statement"), Red Hat does not knowingly accept information from minors under the age of 16 online. Moreover, Red Hat policy dictates Red Hat not deliver or administer Red Hat Certification Exams to any persons under the age of eighteen (18). In countries where the age of majority is lower or higher than 18 years old, Red Hat will defer to local law(s). In either case, Red Hat reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to make any exception to this policy on a case by case basis and may require parental or guardian consent from minors under the age of 18 who wish to register for Red Hat Training. Accordingly, in such cases, minors under the age of 18, who desire to register for Red Hat training and/or certification exams must have their parent or guardian read and sign the[Parental Consent form](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/red-hat-training-parental-consent-form-minors "Parental Consent form") and email/ fax it to the indicated contact at Red Hat, prior to enrollment.

**Limitation of Liability:** Red Hat shall not be liable for any interruption or delay of service, loss of service time, loss of personal data or other defects in any service provided (including failure to provide such service), if such interruption, delay, loss or defect are the result of actions or events beyond Red Hat’s reasonable control, including, but not necessarily limited to force majeure events, acts of foreign governments, and war.

**Not For Resale:** Resale of Red Hat training products and exams, by the purchaser to a third party, is strictly prohibited, unless the purchaser is an active authorized Red Hat distribution partner, reseller partner or training reseller partner. Red Hat reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse to deliver service on any Red hat product or exam that has been resold by a non-authorized party.

**Export Control Restrictions:** Red Hat observes and abides by all United States export control guidelines and sanctions rulings on applicable countries, organizations and individuals. Red Hat will not deliver any training events or services, public or private, to organizations or individuals subject to US export control restrictions or sanctions. And, no attendance in classes or purchasing of subscriptions, online access or other training materials and content will be allowed by any government, organization or individual subject to United States export control restrictions and sanctions, or by any organization or individual operating or residing in any country or region of a country currently under US export control restrictions or sanctions, regardless of where such purchases may originate or where the Red Hat training events in question are being held. Individuals residing in the embargoed territories of Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria are prohibited from purchasing Red Hat products, attending Red Hat training, or taking exams with Red Hat, a company headquartered in the United States and subject to U.S. Export Administration regulations. Individuals who present approved candidate identification showing a non-embargoed country residence may attend Red hat Training, take Red Hat exams and receive certifications.

**Open Enrollment Training**
----------------------------

**Registration:** Open enrollment events are exclusively for registered Named Participants. Unregistered individuals may not attend or view an event at any time.

**Prohibited Use:** Unauthorized recording, copying, or transmission of Open Enrollment content is strictly prohibited.

**Cancellation and Rescheduling of Open Enrollment Events:** Client may reschedule or cancel a purchased seat in a class or exam up to fourteen (14) days prior to the class/exam start date. If Client cancels a class or exam at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the class/exam start date, Client is eligible to receive a refund of paid registration fees, upon request. Client will not be eligible for a refund of paid registration fees if Red Hat does not receive a notice of cancellation or rescheduling at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the class/exam start date.

**Substitution of Enrollees:** Client may substitute enrollees as long as the substitution is made no fewer than seven (7) calendar days prior to the class start date for classes or the exam date for exams. It is the responsibility of Client to ensure that the substitute enrollee meets the stated course prerequisites and is provided with any course materials already provided to enrollees.

**Virtual Training (VT):** All Open Enrollment terms and conditions apply to Virtual Training. Registered Named Participants enrolled in a Virtual Training event must view the event from the country listed on the registration form. No individuals other than the Named Participant may view a Virtual Training event with the Named Participant. And, unauthorized recording, copying, or transmission of VT content is strictly prohibited. The student materials for VT classes are provided in digital eBook format via the Red Hat Training Bookshelf portal Once a Named Participant has been granted access to the student guide eBook/kit for an event, the event will be non-refundable, and Named Participants may not be substituted.

**Virtual Training System Requirements:** Clients are responsible for meeting the minimum system requirements to attend VT. It is Client’s responsibility to ensure the compatibility of his/her system and that the system and network performance comply with [Red Hat’s requirements](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/red-hat-training-and-certification-classroom-requirements "Red Hat’s requirements").

**Guaranteed to Run (GTR):** Red Hat may designate certain published open enrollment and virtual training events as Guaranteed-to-Run (GTR). A GTR notification can be found on scheduled course listings. Red Hat reserves the right to remove or cancel a GTR class if there are no paying students enrolled twenty-one (21) days prior to the start date of the class.

**Substitution by Red Hat:** If Red Hat removes a class from its open enrollment training portfolio, Red Hat reserves the right to substitute with a similar class that will be offered at the same location and date.

**Changes/Suspension:** Red Hat reserves the right to change the schedule of a GTR class if prevented from delivering the class by causes beyond Red Hat’s reasonable control, such as but not limited to: nonperformance or delays caused by acts of God, wars, riots, strikes, fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, government restrictions, terrorist acts, or other causes beyond its reasonable control.

**NO GUARANTEE:** NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN YOUR AGREEMENT, RED HAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT RED HAT TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE EVEN FOR CLIENTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE SYSTEM TESTING PROCESS PRIOR TO THE CLASS START DATE.

Named Participants further agree to keep all such exam content, solutions and lab environments confidential unless and until they become generally available to the public through no fault of theirs, or unless Red Hat provides prior written authorization of a particular disclosure.
* If Named Participants disclose such confidential Information in violation of this Section by any means, they will be undermining the integrity and security of the Red Hat exam and any certification program associated with it and, accordingly, they agree that Red Hat may revoke their Red Hat certifications (including prior certifications), nullify their results and bar them from taking any additional Red Hat exams in addition to pursuing other legal actions permitted under applicable law. Such disclosure (or threatened disclosure) may cause irreparable harm to Red Hat for which monetary damages may be insufficient and, in such event, Red Hat shall be entitled to seek all available equitable remedies, including and without limitation injunctive relief.
* Named Participants further acknowledge and agree that while taking a Red Hat proctored exam (i) with the exception of an exam delivered by an authorized proctor in a classroom setting, if any other person(s) is (are) detected as being present in Named Participants’ workspace location, whether physically detected, overheard in any manner, by the making of noise or through sounds irrespective of whether they are in their immediate workspace location during the exam session or (ii) if the use of any material in any form and by any means or the use of any monitors, laptops, smart or connected devices, or any other personal belongings other than the device used for the purpose of Named Participants' exam is detected during the exam session, Red Hat may at its sole discretion terminate the exam, Named Participants may not receive any score and Red Hat may take the other actions set forth herein. In the event that Named Participants have completed the exam, their score may be invalidated or revoked.

If Named Participants do not agree to the terms set forth herein, they will not be allowed to proceed with the exam and will forfeit the full exam fee.

Red Hat reserves the right to bar individuals suspected of such behavior from taking exams.
    
    **Exam Results and Delivery:**
    
    * **Exam Scores:** Red Hat only reports total exam scores. Red Hat will not provide additional information or details beyond the contents of the score report provided to Named Participants.
    * **Criteria for Passing:** Criteria for passing a Red Hat exam is at the sole discretion of Red Hat. Additionally, Red Hat has the discretion to determine whether a Named Participant has passed a Red Hat exam based on an evaluation of that Named Participant’s performance on the Red Hat exam.

[**Back to top**](#top)

**Red Hat Individual Exams**
----------------------------

Red Hat Individual Exams (also known here as **"Individual Exams"**) are certification exams administered via specially configured testing systems. Individual Exams can be delivered at a Red Hat testing center or online as a Remote Exam.

**Individual Exam Scheduling:** Named Participants have one (1) year from date of purchase to schedule and take the exam. No extensions of the one (1) year term will be granted. A Named Participant must schedule their exam start time no less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to their selected start date and time.

**No Cancellation of Purchase:** All Red Hat Individual Exam purchases are final, and fees are non-refundable.

**Daily Limit:** A Named Participant may not take the same exam more than once in the same day. Red Hat may at its sole discretion elect to enforce a minimum interval between exam attempts.

**Rescheduling Individual Exams:** Individual Exams can be rescheduled up to twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled exam session. Any changes made to the start time of a scheduled exam less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled start time will result in forfeiture of the Named Participant’s exam authorization.

**No Exchange for Red Hat Classroom Exams:** Red Hat does not permit exchanging an Individual Exam for a Classroom Exam. In the event that a Named Participant chooses to change their scheduled Individual Exam to a Red Hat Classroom Exam, they will be required to cancel their Individual Exam and book a new Red Hat Classroom Exam, thereby forfeiting their Individual Exam fees.

**Substitution of Named Participants:** Named Participant substitution for Individual Exam sessions is not allowed at any time.

**Late Arrivals and No Show Policy:** Failure to attend an exam, or arriving more than fifteen (15) minutes after the start time of an exam will result in forfeiture of the exam session and fee, and the Named Participant will not be eligible to reschedule the exam.

**Country of Purchase:** Unless otherwise approved by Red Hat in writing, all Individual Exams must be taken in the enrollee’s country of residence at the time of purchase. Named Participants are prohibited from taking their exams remotely from a country under embargo by the United States.

**Red Hat Individual Exam Day Rules and Requirements:** In addition to the terms set forth in the section [Red Hat Certification and Preliminary Exam General Terms](#terms) above, the terms below explain the additional rules and requirements on exam day for Red Hat Individual Exams.

* **Identity Authentication:** A photo of the Named Participant will be taken prior to the start of the exam and the Named Participant must present a current government issued photo identification (preferably a valid passport). Government issued identification that uses non-Latin characters must be verified by a local Red Hat representative at the testing location or the online proctor in the case of Red Hat Remote Exams prior to the Named Participant taking a Red Hat exam.
* **Individual Exam Monitoring:** By taking a Red Hat Individual Exam Named Participant will be monitored in real time by a combination of a human proctor and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect cheating or content theft during exams in order to protect Red Hat’s legitimate interest in the integrity of its testing and certification processes. Both AI and human proctors will monitor video and audio streams of Named Participant while taking the exam to detect behaviors that might indicate misconduct, such as the presence of another person in the room or eye movements that suggest Named Participant might be consulting notes or other prohibited materials. AI will only be used for the purpose of providing an alert to human proctors that a behavior has been observed that might indicate misconduct, but AI will not take actions or make decisions about Named Participant’s exam session. These will only be made by one or more remote human proctors.
* Communication with the proctor is available in several languages. The proctor will guide Named Participant through the onboarding process using live video. The proctor (a human) has the discretion to immediately terminate the exam if a Named Participant is suspected of cheating or any type of misconduct. Such violations will be immediately reported to the Red Hat Certification team, which may result in penalties including, but not limited to, nullification of exam results and revocation of exam pass status and certification.
* Prior to starting the Red Hat Individual Exam, Named Participants will be presented with a Red Hat Exam Privacy & Confidentiality Agreement where they will be asked to review and confirm that they will comply with the terms of the confidentiality of Red Hat exams as listed above under [Confidentiality of Red Hat Certification and Preliminary Exams](#confidentiality) in addition to the terms below. Named Participants will be asked to acknowledge and agree to the taking of video recordings of their face, image, desk, workspace and possible audio recordings during the exam for Red Hat’s legitimate interests in processing such data for the purposes of exam quality, security and the integrity of the exam process. In order to proceed with taking a Red Hat exam, Named Participants are asked to acknowledge and agree to being continuously by video and audio in real time by a combination of a human proctor and Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine while taking the exam (more details on the use of AI are immediately above under "Individual Exam Monitoring"), the processing of such personal data by Red Hat and its third party data processors, and the transfer of such data to Red Hat and its authorized third party data processors in the United States or other countries where they are located. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Named Participants are asked to acknowledge that they have no expectation of privacy as regards their face, image, audio or actions during the exam, and agree to waive any and all claims asserting a violation of their right to privacy during the exam insofar as such claims pertain to the recording of their face, image, audio or actions during the exam. If Named Participants do not agree to be recorded by video or audio for the purposes as described, they will not be allowed to proceed with the exam.
* **Maintenance of Exam Data and Digital Artifacts:** Red Hat saves and stores various digital artifacts associated with Individual Exams, including disk images for the virtual machines used during an exam, the video recording of the exam session, and chat logs, among other elements. Except where required by applicable law, Red Hat is not responsible for the loss of digital artifacts due to causes beyond Red Hat’s reasonable control, including, but not necessarily limited to, hosting facility error or negligence, fire, theft, vandalism, war, acts of foreign governments, or other force majeure events.  
    Individual Exams are subject to the Red Hat Exam Privacy and Confidentiality Agreement. Violation of these policies or other behavior that suggests misconduct may result in the remote monitor pausing or terminating an exam.
    
    **Red Hat Remote Exams**  
    Red Hat Remote Exams provide an individual online testing option that is both convenient and flexible. A Named Participant is responsible for providing their own device and connectivity. Red Hat Remote Exams are certification exams delivered through a configured and restricted live environment for the sole purpose of delivering the Red Hat Remote Exam. Nothing is installed on Named Participants’ systems during the exam session and Red Hat does not save any information or hold any information on the devices after Named Participants log out from their exam session.
    
    **Red Hat Remote Exam-Specific Compatibility Test:** Named Participants are required to run a compatibility test from within the Remote Exam live environment in advance of their scheduled exam date preferably at the same time of day as the scheduled exam. This allows Named Participants to check the compatibility of the hardware and network that they plan on using to take the exam. Named Participants can only proceed with their scheduled Red Hat Remote Exam if their compatibility test is successful. It is therefore imperative to ensure that the compatibility test is completed in advance of the scheduled exam. Named Participants are advised to cancel the scheduled exam and not to reschedule until they have resolved the issues raised by the compatibility test. A successful run of the compatibility tool does not guarantee the absence of issues when the exam is delivered. Because Named Participants will use their personally provided device, location and network, Red Hat cannot troubleshoot these for any of the Named Participants. In the event there are problems that significantly impede Named Participants’ ability to take the exam, Red Hat at its sole discretion will allow the Named Participant to discontinue and reschedule the exam at a later date.
    
* **Red Hat Remote Exam System and Hardware Requirements:**
    * Named Participants electing to take a Remote Exam must meet certain system and hardware requirements as published by Red Hat under [Getting Ready for your Red Hat Remote Exam](https://learn.redhat.com/t5/Certification-Resources/Getting-Ready-for-your-Red-Hat-Remote-Exam/ba-p/12690) and provided to Named Participants. Red Hat may update these requirements from time to time at Red Hat’s sole discretion. It is the responsibility of the Named Participant to ensure that their device and connectivity meet any requirements published by Red Hat.
    * The hardware requirements include the use of one external web camera. Any sustained interruption of the web camera feed may result in the termination of the exam session without refund.
* **Red Hat Remote Exam Workspace Policy:**
    * In addition to the above policy regarding “Wearing/Use of Personal Devices in Testing Locations”, Named Participants taking a Red Hat Remote Exam will need to ensure that there are no Smart devices, writing instruments or objects (including but not limited to pens, pencils, markers), printed materials (including but not limited to paper, sticky notes, notepads, books, memo cards), or any items on the wall with writing (including but not limited to whiteboards or pictures) in close proximity or on their desks or in their workspace. If a Named Participant’s workspace does not pass a room scan, they will not be permitted to proceed with the exam. Suitability of the exam workspace is entirely at Red Hat’s discretion and an exam may be cancelled or rescheduled for any of the aforementioned reasons or for reasons other than those mentioned herein.
    * Only one physical display will be allowed for the exam. Named Participants must turn off and unplug any additional laptops, computers, monitors, displays or any other personal equipment or hardware in their workspace other than the computer or laptop used for the exam. Named Participants will not be allowed to proceed with the Remote Exam until the requirement specified herein is met.
* **NO GUARANTEE:** NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN OR IN RED HAT AND CLIENT’S AGREEMENT, RED HAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT RED HAT EXAM SESSION STREAMS WILL BE PROVIDED UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, EVEN FOR NAMED PARTICIPANTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE COMPATIBILITY TESTING PROCESS PRIOR TO THE EXAM START DATE.
    
    **Red Hat Remote Exam-Specific Disclaimers:**
    
    * Red Hat is not responsible for any issues arising from a Named Participant’s device being connected to the testing environment or any service issues arising from device performance, network connectivity, or functioning of the Named Participant’s network or the public network infrastructure, or use of hardware or software by a Named Participant that does not meet the requirements published by Red Hat.
    * Red Hat cannot assume responsibility for the proper functioning of a Named Participant’s network. Named Participants must choose a reliable network and are required to run the compatibility test to ensure a suitable environment. Should network connectivity problems arise within the first thirty (30) minutes of the exam and the Named Participant is unable to resolve the connectivity problems, they can request to have the exam attempt discontinued and will be allowed to reschedule the Red Hat exam.
    * Red Hat is not responsible for damage or other impact to a Named Participant’s device while connected to the Red Hat remote testing environment, or after they have logged off and out of the Red Hat remote testing environment, or as a result of taking the Red Hat Remote Exam, including but not limited to: the device being hacked; the device infected by any malicious software; any loss of data or any changes in the operation of a Named Participant’s device.
* **Non-availability of Red Hat Remote Exams in People’s Republic of China:** Red Hat Remote Exams are not available or approved for sale or delivery or guaranteed for access in the People’s Republic of China. Red Hat makes no guarantee as to the quality of service, availability of access or continuity of access to Red Hat Remote Exams in the People’s Republic of China. A Named Participant who purchases their Remote Exam in another country, and who attempts to access their Remote Exam in the People’s Republic of China, may experience a slower or diminished quality of service, or may find they are unable to access the Remote Exam environment. In any such case, no refund, compensation or rescheduled delivery shall be made to the Named Participant by Red Hat.
