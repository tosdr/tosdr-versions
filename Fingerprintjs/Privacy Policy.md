ANNEX 1

[](#annex-1)

**EEA, SWISS AND UK DISCLOSURES**

This Annex 1 (the "**European Data Annex**") sets out how we collect, store, process, transfer, share and use data that identifies or is associated with you ("**personal data**") when you access our Service from the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom.

This European Data Annex was last updated on May 7th, 2021.

#### 

**1\. Who is responsible for the use of your personal data**

[](#1-who-is-responsible-for-the-use-of-your-personal-data)

There are various ways in which we collect and receive personal data about you when you use the Service, and our relationship with you with respect to your personal data will vary depending on our relationship with you, how we collect this personal data and how we use it.

In certain circumstances we will act as the controller of your personal data, which means we determine and are responsible for how that personal data is used.

In other circumstances we act as a processor on behalf of another person, meaning that our use of this personal data is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/terms-of-service) and, where applicable, the [data processing addendum](https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/dpa-gdpr).

The following summarizes where we believe we act as a controller and where we would consider ourselves to act as a processor:

* **When you subscribe to the Service and set up an account**, whether on your own behalf or on behalf of your employer, we will be the controller of your personal data that you provide to us, such as your name and other contact details, your payment details and transaction details (including the details of the type of service you have purchased).
    
* **When someone else sets up an account on the Service (the "Customer") and gives you access to the Service (and makes you an "Authorised User")**, such as your employer, we will process the personal data about you (such as your contact details) that they submit to us as a processor on their behalf.
    
* **When you access and use the Service**, we will be a controller in respect of any information about your use of the Service, such as the pages you access and functionalities you use, as well as information about the type of device you use to access the Service.
    
* **When you submit support requests to us**, we will process any personal data contained in that support request as a processor on behalf of the relevant Customer.
    
* **When you submit comments and opinions to us**, and we use those comments and opinions to improve the Service or develop new products, we will be the controller of the personal data contained in those comments and opinions; and
    
* **With respect to End User Data**, we act as a processor on behalf of the relevant Customer.
    

This European Data Annex applies to our use of your personal data when we act as a controller of that personal data.
