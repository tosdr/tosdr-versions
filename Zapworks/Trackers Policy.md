Cookie Notice: Zapworks
=======================

Last updated: **16 May** **2024**

### **Purpose of this notice**

This notice should be read alongside our Privacy Notice published in connection with Zapworks, which is a service operated by Zappar Limited (**“Zappar”** or **“we”**). In this notice we talk about what cookies and similar technologies we use in connection with Zapworks and the Zapworks website (collectively, the **“Services”**) and why we use them.

### **Obtaining your consent**

Certain features of the Services may depend upon cookies to function. UK and EU Cookie Law deems these cookies to be “strictly necessary”. Any strictly necessary cookies used by the Services are identified below. Your consent is not required to place these cookies on your device, but it is still important that you are aware of them. You may still block these cookies by changing your internet browser’s settings as detailed below: “Enabling & Disabling of Cookies”.

Consent for other cookies is obtained through a “pop up box” on the Zapworks landing page.

### **What are cookies?**

When we talk about “cookies” we mean a small text file stored on your computer, smartphone, tablet or other device (each a **“Device”**) while you are visiting a website or using an online service. Cookies help make websites work. They also provide us with information about how users interact with the Services. We use this information to try to improve your experience when using the Services and to improve, market and promote our products and services (including Zapworks). We may also use cookies to remember personal settings you have chosen for the Services. 

“Other technologies” refer to technologies that function similar to cookies,  including pixel tags, locally shared objects, hardware-based device identifiers, flash cookies, operating system-based identifiers, clear GIFs and web beacons.

For convenience, we use the term cookies in this notice as a collective term to refer to both cookies and other technologies.

### **Basic types of cookies used**

The types of cookies used by the Services fall into the following general categories:

**Essential:** also referred to as being “strictly necessary”, these cookies are essential to the operation of the Services, supporting functions such as logging in, security, shopping baskets and payment transactions.

**Non-essential:** these cookies are not essential to the operation of the Services, e.g. analytics and advertising cookies and all third party cookies.

**First party cookies:** first party cookies are those placed directly on your Device by Zappar via the Services and are used only by Zappar. 

**Third party cookies:** third party cookies are those placed by online services, websites and/or companies other than Zappar. These cookies may continue to track you after you have left the Services.

**Session cookies:** session cookies are temporary and only remain on a Device from the point at which the user visits or accesses the Services until they close their browser. Session cookies are deleted when the browser is closed.

**Persistent cookies:** persistent cookies remain on a Device for a predetermined period of time (or until you delete them) and are activated each time a user visits or accesses the Services.

### **How we use cookies: overview**

The cookies we use perform the following basic functions:

**Analytics:** these cookies are used to understand how users use the Services, e.g. Google Analytics and our own proprietary analytics system called Zapalytics.

**Functionality:** these cookies enable the provision of additional functions and improve website performance, e.g. personalisation and remembering saved preferences. Some may be strictly necessary, but not all fall into this category.

**Security:** these cookies are used for security purposes, e.g. enabling your to login securely and prevention of cross-site request forgery. 

  
**Social Media and Marketing:** these cookies are used to (a) target visitors with communications for our services when the user logs into or uses another service, e.g. social media; (b) make advertisements more relevant and meaningful to visitors to our websites, and to track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns, both on our services and on other websites; and (c) make communications more relevant through marketing automation.

### **Cookies set by Zappar**

When you visit the Zapworks website or use Zapworks, the following first party cookies may be placed on your Device:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Domain** | **Type** | **Description** | **Essential (Y/N)** |

| my.zap.works<br><br>zap.works | Security | This cookie is a random key used to prevent cross-site request forgery. The cookie expires 12 months after it has been set on your Device. | Y   |

### **Use of Google Analytics**

The Services use analytics services provided by Google Analytics. Google Analytics refers to a set of tools used to collect and analyse usage statistics, enabling us to better understand how people use our websites. This, in turn, enables us to improve the websites and the products and services offered through them. You do not have to allow us to use these cookies (please see “Enabling & Disabling of Cookies” below); however whilst our use of them does not pose any risk to your privacy or your safe use of our websites, it does enable us to continually improve our business.

The Google Analytics services used by our websites set and use cookies to gather the required information. These analytics cookies are not strictly necessary and are used to collect information about how visitors use the websites. We use this information to compile reports and to help us improve the websites. The Google Analytics cookies collect information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the websites, where visitors have come to the websites from, the pages they visited and for how long. This information is collected by Zappar but Google will also have access to the data.

Further information about Google Analytics can be found here: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) 

### **Use of Google Analytics advertising features**

In addition to analytics, we may also use the following Google Analytics Advertising features and related cookies on the Services:

* Remarketing with Google Analytics & Adwords
    
* User ID feature
    
* Advertising features, including demographics and infinity categories
    

These Advertising Features enable Google Analytics to collect information about our website traffic via Google advertising cookies and identifiers. See here for more information about these cookies: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/types](https://policies.google.com/technologies/types)  

  
 

### **Cookies set on Zapworks by other companies**

Zapworks allows the following companies other than Zappar to set cookies through the Zapworks website. Depending on how you use the Services these companies may set and access cookies on your Device.

### **Third party cookies in embedded content**

Some pages of our websites have videos embedded within them. When you play these videos the third party hosting the video, e.g. Google Video, Vimeo, YouTube may set cookies on your device. These third party cookies are used to enable the video to play and to collect analytics data such as how long a viewer has watched the video.

### **Enabling & disabling of cookies**

You can choose to enable or disable cookies in your internet browser (for instance, by using a “private” or “incognito” mode). Most internet browsers also enable you to choose whether you wish to disable all cookies or only third party cookies. By default, most internet browsers accept cookies but this can be changed. For further details, please consult the help menu in your internet browser.

You can choose to delete cookies at any time however you may lose any information that enables you to access the Services more quickly and efficiently including, but not limited to, personalised account settings. If you disable security cookies this will prevent you from being able to login to Zapworks. 

To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you can find help at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

It is recommended that you ensure that your internet browser is up-to-date and that you consult the help and guidance provided by the developer of your internet browser if you are unsure about adjusting your privacy settings.

### **Changes to this notice**
