Zapworks Terms of Use
=====================

Last updated: **23rd April 2024**

THESE TERMS OF USE (“TOU”) TOGETHER WITH ANY POLICIES OR LEGAL NOTICES THAT WE MAY PUBLISH FROM TIME TO TIME GOVERN YOUR USE OF ZAPWORKS, BOTH FREE TRIAL AND PAID, AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ZAPPAR LIMITED. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY AS THEY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER THE LAW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TOU, PLEASE DO NOT REGISTER FOR OR USE ZAPWORKS. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE TOU, PLEASE CONTACT [LEGAL@ZAPPAR.COM](mailto:legal@zappar.com).

PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEPT WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THEIR PARENT OR SCHOOL. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE AND REGISTERING TO USE THE SERVICES WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU READ THIS DOCUMENT TOGETHER WITH YOUR PARENT OR TEACHER.

### **1\. Nature of the Services** 

Zapworks is a set of proprietary tools and services for building augmented, virtual and mixed reality content for distribution using the Zappar mobile application, a custom app solution provided by Zappar, or Zappar WebAR. Our native mobile applications operate on iOS and Android. The Zapworks Studio downloadable SDK is currently only compatible with OS X and Windows operating systems. 

For users with a Hobbyist or Developer plan the supply of a zapcode constitutes a supply of “digital content” for the purposes of the right to cancel provided for in The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (referred to below as the “Contract Regulations”).

Further information about Zapworks can be found on our documents site: [https://docs.zap.works/](https://docs.zap.works/)

Where a workspace is created using a business or organisation email (e.g. joebloggs@ABCLimited.com) the Account Holder is the business or organisation you represent. If it is not clear who the intended Account Holder is the final determination will be made by Zappar in its sole and absolute discretion and the name of the Account Holder entered in Zappar’s records will be conclusive.

**“Authorised User”** means, in relation to Business Plans and Education plans, an employee, contractor, pupil or student of the Account Holder (also known as a “member”) who is for the time being authorised by the Account Holder to access and use the Services via a Login.

The section and paragraph headings are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. Unless stated otherwise, references to a Section is to a section of these TOU.

Where a conflict, ambiguity or difference exists in the interpretation, wording or meaning of a provision or term in any of our published policy documents, or in any written communication to you, the provision or term contained in the most recent policy document or communication shall apply.

These TOU were originally written in the English language (UK). To the extent any translated version of these TOU conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.

### **3\. Acceptance of terms**

Your use of the Services is subject to the following Terms of Use. Creating a Zapworks Account and/or using the Services is an acknowledgement of, and agreement to be legally bound by the provisions of the TOU. If you do not agree to the TOU, you are not permitted to use the Services. 

### **4\. Changes to these terms**

We may, at our sole and absolute discretion, revise, modify or replace these TOU by updating the posting on the Zapworks Website at any time with or without notice to you. You should visit the Zapworks Website from time to time to review the current version of the TOU because they are legally binding upon you. If you do not wish to accept the new TOU you should not continue to use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after the date on which any changes come into effect, your use of the Services indicates your agreement to be legally bound by the new TOU.

### **5\. Opening an account with us**

**5.1 Who is allowed to use the Services?**

You are only allowed to use the Services if you meet the following criteria and represent and warrant that you: (a) are 13 years of age or older, or are under the age of 13 and your Parent or School has given permission for you to participate in the Services; (b) are not currently restricted or prohibited from using the Services; (c) will only maintain one Hobbyist or Developer plan at any given time; (d) meet the Financial Eligibility Requirement (if applicable); (e) will comply with these TOU at all times; and (f) agree to provide at your cost all equipment, resources, software and internet access necessary to use the Services.

The individual opening a Zapworks Account on behalf of a Business User or an Education User represents and warrants that: (a) he/she has full power and authority to enter into and accept these TOU on behalf of the Business User or Education User; (b) the Business User or Education User is a legal entity capable of entering into contractual relations; and (c) using the Services will not violate any other agreement to which the Business User or Education User is a party.

If you do not meet all eligibility requirements outlined in these TOU, or cease to meet them, you are not allowed to use the Services. Zappar also reserves the right, at our sole and absolute discretion, to refuse to accept any request to open a Zapworks Account or create a login for the Services.

**5.2 Financial Eligibility Requirement for Business Plans**

This Section 5.2 applies to Business Plans.

If your gross revenues and/ or funding (no matter what the source) is greater than $10 million (the “Financial Threshold”) in the 12 month period immediately prior to your registering for Zapworks, you must purchase an Enterprise plan by contacting our sales team. You are not permitted to purchase a Starter or Pro plan.

The Financial Threshold is measured in US Dollars and your gross revenues and/or funding will be converted to US Dollars to determine your eligibility. If you are a corporate entity, when calculating your gross revenues and funding you must include the revenues and funding of your parent companies, subsidiaries and all other companies in your corporate group. If you are a not-for-profit entity whether or not you exceed the Financial Threshold is determined by your budget for the entire year and not just the department using the Services.

Account Holders with a Starter or Pro plan must meet the Financial Eligibility Requirement at all times and throughout the period of their subscription.

Accounts Holders who are below the Financial Threshold when they purchase a Starter or Pro plan, and therefore meet the Financial Eligibility Requirement at that time, but whose finances subsequently exceed the Financial Threshold measured over any 12 month period of their subscription must contact the Zappar sales team within two (2) business days of the occurrence of this event and upgrade their plan or plans to an Enterprise plan, if they wish to continue using the Services. Alternatively, the Account Holder and their Authorised Users must cease all use of the Services with immediate effect.

Zappar may monitor your compliance with the Financial Eligibility Requirement, including by monitoring the number of interactions with your Zapworks Projects and any available revenue estimate data. We may also ask Account Holders to provide: (a) a written statement signed by a director or officer confirming the Account Holder’s gross revenue and/or funding for the 12 month period prior to the date the statement is signed, and/or (b) such other information as Zappar may reasonably require to confirm that the Account Holder continues to meet the Financial Eligibility Requirement. If Zappar requests that you provide a written statement or other information you must do so within seven (7) days of our written request, unless we agree to an extension of time for compliance. You bear the burden of proving that you meet the Financial Eligibility Requirement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Financial Eligibility Requirement shall apply where an agency is using the Services for or on behalf of an end client which itself meets the Financial Eligibility Requirement and this shall apply irrespective of the financial eligibility status of the agency.

Compliance with this Section 5.2 is a condition of your continued use of the Services, if you fail to comply with any of its provisions, Zappar may terminate your User Agreement and right to

use the Services with immediate effect. Zappar may also terminate your User Agreement and right to use the Services with immediate effect, if we are not satisfied that you meet the Financial Eligibility Requirement.

**5.3 Registration**

To use the Services each User will need to register with us by creating a Zapworks Account, or log-in credentials. You must ensure that the details provided by you on registration or at any time are correct and complete. You must inform us immediately of any changes to the information that you provided when registering by updating your personal details; so that we can communicate with you effectively. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your Zapworks Account and/or your right to use the Services with or without notice to you.

**5.4 Password and security**

The Account Holder is solely responsible for the activity that occurs on their Zapworks Account and for keeping their account secure. The Account Holder therefore agrees to: (a) keep (and procure that their Authorised Users keep) their password and other login credentials secure and confidential; (b) not permit others to use their Zapworks Account unless they are an Authorised User; (c) be responsible for all activity under their Zapworks Account; (d) refrain from selling, trading or otherwise transferring their Zapworks Account or Logins to another party except as permitted by the User Agreement; and (e) refrain from charging anyone for access to any portion of their Zapworks Account. 

If you know or suspect that someone else knows your password or has gained unauthorised access to your Zapworks Account you should notify us immediately by contacting [support@zappar.com](mailto:support@zappar.com). If Zappar has reason to believe that there is likely to be a breach of security or misuse of the Services, we may require you to change your user name and/or password or we may suspend your Zapworks Account or log-in credentials. ZAPPAR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS THAT A USER INCURS AS RESULT OF ANY OTHER PERSON’S USE OF THEIR ZAPWORKS ACCOUNT OR LOGIN CREDENTIALS, WHETHER AUTHORISED OR UNAUTHORISED. 

**5.5 Inactivity**

Zappar reserves the right to remove and/or clear out inactive Zapworks Projects and inactive Zapworks Accounts as part of the general housekeeping procedures we periodically carry out to improve the efficiency and performance of the Services. This housekeeping may result in the temporary or permanent removal or deactivation of the inactive Zapworks Project or Zapworks Account, and erasure or disabling of all content and data connected or related to it, including User Content. For these purposes each of the following are considered to be inactive: (a) Zapworks Projects that have not been engaged with for more than 12 months; (b) Zapworks Accounts that have had no activity on them for 12 months or more, AND no payment has been received during that period, AND no Views have been recorded against any Zapworks Project associated with that Zapworks Account during that period; (c) business or education workspaces that have no active Logins; and (d) business or education workspaces that continue beyond their free trial period and have no active Logins.

  
  
 

### **6\. Right to use the Services**

**6.1 Terms of access**

Subject to compliance with these TOU, and any directions or guidelines published by us from time to time, Zappar grants the User a personal, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited right unless and until terminated under Section 16 (“Ending the User Agreement”) to do the following solely via your Zapworks Account or Login (as the case may be) and for the Permitted Purpose: (a) access and use the Services for the development, publication and distribution of your User Content; and (b) use any instructional material of Zappar expressly authorised by Zappar for use with your Zapworks Project.

**FREE TRIAL USE**. The Zapworks free trial offers users fourteen(14) days to evaluate whether our AR toolkit is right for your business. You must not use the Zapworks free trial for public facing projects, instead you must switch to a paid plan if you wish to do so. Once your trial is over, all your Zapworks Projects will be unpublished and your Content Triggers will no longer show content when scanned. We recommend that you upgrade to a plan before your trial is over to ensure that this does not happen. 

**6.2 Zappar Scanning SDK**

If we allow you to evaluate our Zappar Scanning SDK you are permitted to do so under licence solely within a single mobile application (iOS and Android) for internal and non-commercial testing and evaluation of the component’s functionality and suitability for your purposes. Any commercial use of the Zappar Scanning SDK requires a separate paid-for licence. 

**6.3 Restrictions**

The User must not at any time (directly or indirectly) do any of the following: (a) use the Services for any activity or purpose which is illegal, immoral or improper whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the world; (b) modify, adapt, translate or create derivative works based on the Services, the Zappar Technology or zapcodes; (c) reverse engineer, decipher, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive any source code for, or any other trade secrets embedded in, the Services, the Zappar Technology or zapcodes; (d) copy (in whole or in part) the Services or the Zappar Technology; (e) charge any person for access to or use of the Services; (f) frame, rent, lease, loan, distribute, resell, sublicense or transfer the Services; or (g) access all or any part of the Services in order to build a product or service which competes with the Services. For clarity, these restrictions do not prohibit Business Users from using the Services and their Zapworks Projects in connection with the development, creation, marketing, distribution and sale of their own products and services subject to compliance with these TOU and our Fair Use Policy (see Section 14 below).

The User must not use in any manner Content Triggers belonging to another User without their express consent and the User must not use Content Triggers within any media or on any materials (whether physical or digital) which do not belong to them unless authorised to do so by the owner.

Business Users must not represent Zappar as having approved or endorsed any products or services, or use Zappar’s name or logos on or in connection with any products or services without Zappar’s prior written consent. 

**6.4 Proprietary notices**

The User must not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Services.

**6.5 Reservation of rights**

Zappar retains all right, title and interest in and to the Services, zapcodes and Zappar Technology and all related data and intellectual property rights, except those limited rights to use the Services given in this Section 6. Any content (including software) we provide to you as part of the Services is licensed under these TOU for your use during the term of the User Agreement, and not sold to you. 

### **7\. Fees, payment and refunds**

You must pay all fees applicable to your use of the Services in accordance with your pricing plan. In addition, CPV fees will be charged for Views over and above the number allocated to your plan and for image look-up solutions. You must pay our fees by the date and in the manner described in the invoice, billing agreement or as otherwise notified to you. All sums charged for using the Services are exclusive of taxes, levies or duties (e.g. VAT or other sales taxes) imposed by taxation authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment thereof in addition. Fees are payable in the currency reflected in the relevant invoice or billing agreement.

Any fees not paid in full as and when due shall incur interest which shall accrue on such unpaid amounts at an annual rate of 6% commencing on the due date and continuing until fully paid, whether before or after any judgement. We may also suspend your Zapworks Account and right to use the Services until such time as all overdue payments have been brought up to date.

Zappar reserves the right to change the payment terms and pricing for the Services at our sole and absolute discretion by giving notice to you. The amended pricing and/or payment terms will (unless stated otherwise) be effective from the date of that notice and will apply to any fees incurred by you following the effective date of that price change.

All payments made on the Zapworks Website are processed on our behalf by third party payment providers. You accept that Zappar is not responsible for these third party payment providers and their operation or availability. By agreeing to these TOU, you authorise Zappar or our nominated payment provider to make any reasonable and necessary enquiries to validate your Zapworks Account and financial information. 

Zappar reserves the right to monitor your use of the Services (including the number of persons using your Logins, the number of Views with your Zapworks Projects, and the content associated with your Zapworks Account) for the purposes of ensuring that you are using the Services in compliance with the User Agreement and are paying the correct fees for your use of the Services. If our monitoring reveals a discrepancy between the fees you have paid for the Services and the fees actually due then you will pay the difference to Zappar within five (5) days of request.

When signing up for the Services as a consumer you agree to our supplying you with access to your zapcodes and any other digital content provided with the Services before the end of the cancellation period provided for in regulation 30(1) of the Contract Regulations. You acknowledge that as a consequence the right to cancel the User Agreement under regulation 29(1) of the Contract Regulations will be lost. Each zapcode generated by the Services is unique and once allocated to a User cannot be re-utilised. 

Zappar operates a “NO RETURNS” policy across all our plans and all fees charged for the use of the Services (including any VAT and other taxes charged on the fees) are NON-REFUNDABLE except as required by applicable law. In the case of Personal Users, this policy does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer.

### **8\. User warranties and indemnity**

You represent, warrant and undertake that: 

* any Zapworks Account created by or on your behalf is for your own personal, business or educational use (as applicable) and the account has not been created with the intention to impersonate, falsely represent or create a false association with another person;
    
* your use of the Services will be in strict accordance with these TOU and with all applicable laws and regulations including any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city or other governmental area regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of personal data outside the United Kingdom, the European Economic Area (EEA) or the country in which you reside;
    
* you will comply with the rules and regulations of your mobile device service providers, internet service providers and other third party service providers;
    
* (If you are a Business User or an Education User) you will comply with the prudent practices, methods, specifications and standards of safety and performance commonly used in operations similar to those of your business or profession, including any advertising standards, professional standards or codes of practice; and
    
* all information provided by you to Zappar is and will remain throughout your use of the Services true, accurate and complete. You will promptly notify Zappar of any material change in that information. 
    

**INDEMNIFICATION.** You acknowledge that any breach of these TOU may cause Zappar damage or loss and you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Zappar and its employees, directors, officers and shareholders (collectively, the **“Zappar Indemnified Parties”**) against any and all liabilities, claims, actions, proceedings, losses, damages, expenses and costs (including court costs and legal fees) whether direct, indirect or consequential and including any economic loss or other loss of profits, business or goodwill which Zappar or any of the Zappar Indemnified Parties may suffer or incur as a result of any of the following matters: (a) your use of the Services, including Content Triggers; (b) your User Content; and (c) any breach by you or anyone acting on your behalf of these TOU.

### **9\. User Content: general rules**

Strict compliance with the following provisions of Sections 9, 10 and 11 are a condition of the User Agreement. If you make use of the Upload Feature on any of your zapcodes you are responsible for managing your legal relationship with the end users of your zapcodes and putting in place any necessary terms of use and privacy policies. You will ensure that persons uploading content to your zapcodes via the Upload Feature do so in compliance with Section 9, 10 and 11 of these TOU.

Users acknowledge that the Services are designed to be accessible via the Internet and Zappar does not guarantee any confidentiality or privacy with respect to User Content. Any User Content that you publish may potentially become visible to anyone who activates the associated Content Trigger(s). Furthermore, due to the nature of the Internet and search engines in particular, User Content may remain on devices or websites not operated or controlled by Zappar even after such User Content has been removed or deleted from our systems. You acknowledge and agree that any User Content published to the Services may become openly available across the Internet.

You acknowledge and agree that you and not Zappar are solely responsible for all User Content that you make available through the Services including the content that is uploaded to your zapcodes via the Upload Feature. User Content will not be vetted or edited in advance by Zappar and Zappar exercises no editorial control over User Content. Notwithstanding this, Zappar reserves the right at our sole and absolute discretion (but shall have no obligation) to refuse, suspend access to or remove any User Content available through the Services at any time. We do not need a reason to exercise this right (or to give you prior notice), but we would normally only refuse, suspend access to or remove content if: (a) we deem it to be unlawful or in breach of these TOU; or (b) we receive a complaint about your User Content; or (c) we receive a Court Order requiring its removal from our systems; or (d) the content violates our terms of service with our server provider. User Content that has been removed may continue to be stored by us in order to comply with legal obligations. For details on how we handle complaints about User Content please click on the following link: [zap.works/unlawful-content-policy/](https://zap.works/unlawful-content-policy/)   

While Zappar makes reasonable efforts to ensure that Content Triggers correctly point to the User Content that Users and their end users have assigned to them, you acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility to test and check the correct functionality of all Content Triggers before putting them into use.

### **12\. Privacy and data protection**

In this Section 12 the expressions “Personal Data”, “Controller”, “Processor” and “process” or “processing” have the meaning given to them by Section 3 of the UK Data Protection Act 2018.

You should carefully read our Privacy Notice for Zapworks before deciding to become a User. The Privacy Notice describes what information, including Personal Data, we may collect from you in connection with the Services and how we use that information. Our Privacy Notice is available at [https://zap.works/privacy/](https://zap.works/privacy/) Your use of the Services may also result in cookies and similar technologies being placed on your computer or mobile device. This is explained in our Cookie Notice available at [https://zap.works/cookies/](https://zap.works/cookies/) 

Except as expressly stated otherwise in our Privacy Notice, the User is responsible for any collection, storage, disclosure and use of, and access to, Personal Data of any person that relates to the User’s use of the Services including any Personal Data contained within the User’s User Content. In particular, it is understood that the Privacy Notice mentioned above does not apply to any Personal Data that the User collects from end users of their Zapworks Projects in their capacity as a Controller (including Personal Data collected from individuals using the Upload Feature). The User must ensure that they inform their end users of what Personal Data the User collects from end users of their Zapworks Projects and how the User will use the Personal Data. Use of the Upload Feature is conditional on the User taking responsibility for complying with all applicable data protection and privacy legislation.

If Zappar processes any Personal Data on a User’s behalf when providing the Services, the parties record their intention that the User shall be the Controller and Zappar shall be acting solely as a Processor and, in any such case, the following general principles apply:

* the User acknowledges and agrees that the Personal Data may be transferred or stored outside the United Kingdom, EEA or the country where the User is located in order to carry out the Services and Zappar’s other obligations under these TOU;
    
* the User shall ensure that the User is entitled to transfer the relevant Personal Data to Zappar so that Zappar may lawfully use, process and transfer the Personal Data in accordance with these TOU on the User's behalf;
    
* the User shall ensure that the relevant third parties (including end users of the User’s Zapworks Projects) have been informed of, and (where legally required) have given their valid consent to, such use, processing, and transfer as required by all applicable data protection legislation;
    
* Zappar shall process the Personal Data only in accordance with the TOU and any lawful instructions reasonably given by the User from time to time; and
    
* each party shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures against unauthorised or unlawful processing of the Personal Data or its accidental loss, destruction or damage.
    

Where applicable, the [Zapworks Data Processing Addendum](https://zap.works/dpa/) shall apply to the processing of any Personal Data by Zappar on behalf of the User. 

### **13\. Analytics**

Business Plans and Education plans come with Zapalytics our proprietary data dashboard and reporting product. The data collected by our analytics system belongs to us, but you are free to use the reports generated by our data dashboard for your own internal purposes to evaluate your Zapworks Projects.

You must not create an event in Zapworks that will result in Personal Data being submitted to Zappar’s analytics system. 

For an explanation of what information is collected from end users by Zapalytics please refer to the [Zapworks Privacy Notice](https://zap.works/privacy/)

We may also place upper limits on hosting of data and data transfer from our content delivery network to end users. 

If you breach our Fair Use Policy, we will normally ask you to correct your behaviour first before taking any action, but we reserve the right not to give notice in the case of deliberate, serious or persistent breaches or misuse of the Services.

### **15\. Delivery, availability and modification of the Services**

Zappar will begin to make the Services available to the Account Holder and their Authorised Users at the moment of activating the Zapworks Account. Where an Account Holder opts to use the Services on a free to use basis Zappar only provides those features of the Services that are available on a free to use basis. When the Account Holder starts paid use of the Services Zappar will provide those features of the Services that are available for the type of use paid for, at the moment of receiving payment.

Zappar warrants to the Account Holder that (a) we will perform the Services with reasonable care and skill and (where applicable) within a reasonable time; and (b) the Services will conform substantially to the technical documentation published at  [https://docs.zap.works/](https://docs.zap.works/) We make no promise that the Services will meet your requirements; nor do we guarantee the level of activity that your Zapworks Projects will generate, such as the number of scans you will get.

If a fault occurs with the Services you should report it to [support@zappar.com](mailto:support@zappar.com) and we will attempt to correct the fault as soon as we reasonably can.

Your access to the Services may occasionally be suspended or restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance, updates or the introduction of new facilities or services. If this happens, we will attempt to restore the service as soon as we reasonably can.

The Services will change over time and we may require you to accept updates to the Services. From time to time we may require you to update your software to continue to use the Services. Zappar may perform these updates remotely including to any Zapworks software installed on your device. We also reserve the right to modify, update or discontinue (temporarily, or permanently) the Services (or any aspect thereof); impose limits on certain aspects of the Services; and/or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services. This right may be exercised at any time and with or without notice to Users.

Zappar may, in our sole and absolute discretion, immediately suspend or terminate the User Agreement and your access to and use of all or any aspect of the Services with or without notice and for any reason, including (a) if you breach any of your obligations under these TOU; (b) if Zappar is required to do so by law or through an order of any competent authority; or (c) Zappar permanently discontinues the Services. Suspension of the Services does not affect your obligations to us under these TOU.

Except for Enterprise plans, the Account Holder may cancel the User Agreement and their Zapworks Account for any reason at any time by giving us written notice which shall take effect upon the date we receive your notice at our address given below. If you do cancel your Zapworks Account your plan will be charged for the remainder of the billing cycle (monthly or annual) that you are currently in and your Zapworks Account and your Logins and content will be disabled at the end of the current billing cycle. 

Enterprise plans are available as a yearly contract only and may not be cancelled by the Account Holder for convenience.
