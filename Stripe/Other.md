Stripe Sub-Processors and Service Providers List
================================================

### Last updated: September 13, 2024

To support Stripe in delivering its Services, Stripe engages service providers, Sub-Processors and affiliates to assist Stripe with its data processing activities on behalf of Stripe Business Users as defined in our Stripe Services Agreement.

**Summary of Changes**
----------------------

We’ve updated this page because we strive to be clear about our use of Personal Data and the third party service providers we engage. The below outlines a few highlights of the changes we made, so please review this page carefully. If you have questions or queries, please [contact us](https://stripe.com/au/legal/privacy-center#contact-us).

You will see that we have:

* added new Sub-Processors (Intuition Machines, Inc., Verifi, Inc., Cognizant Worldwide Limited, FrontApp, Inc., Adish Co., Ltd.) and Sub-Processing locations (India for WNS Global Services (UK) International Limited);
* updated the processing activities of Twilio, Inc. to clarify we are also using Twilio for user support;
* removed Sub-Processors (Teleperformance España S.A.U.) and Sub-Processing locations (the Philippines for TDCX (MY) SDN. BHD.);
* updated the name Global Data Consortium, Inc. to London Stock Exchange Group plc since the latter has acquired the former

**What is a Sub-processor?**
----------------------------

When Stripe engages third party service providers in our capacity as a data processor for our Business Users’ personal data, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and a number of other global privacy frameworks call these third-party service providers sub-processors. Sub-processors are service providers who have or potentially will have access to or process personal data that Stripe processes for, and on behalf of, Stripe’s Business Users.

This page outlines the types of service providers, Sub-processors, and affiliates we utilize, where they are located, and a description of the work they carry out.

**Due Diligence**
-----------------

Before engaging any service provider (including Sub-processors), we perform due diligence, including a vendor security assessment. Our service providers are subject to contract terms designed to ensure that these service providers process personal data only for the purposes of providing services to Stripe and in accordance with our commitments to Business Users and applicable data protection laws.

**Updates to this Page**
------------------------

Due to the nature of our global business and the volume of Business Users, our business needs and services providers may change from time to time. For example, we may deprecate a service provider to consolidate and minimize our use of service providers. Similarly, we may add a service provider if we believe that doing so will enhance our ability to deliver our Services.

We will periodically update this page to reflect additions and removals to our list of service providers, Sub-processors and Affiliates. If you are a Business User, you may subscribe to receive email notifications of updates to our list of Sub-processors on this page [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/communication-preferences).

Under the terms of our Data Processing Agreement (DPA), a Business User may reasonably object in writing to the processing of its personal data by a new Sub-processor within 30 days following the update of this page. If a Business User does not object during the 30 day time period, the appointment of the new Sub-processor shall be deemed accepted by the Business User. If you are a Business User and want to know more about our DPA, please contact us.
