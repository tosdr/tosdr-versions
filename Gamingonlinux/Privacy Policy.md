What data we store and where
----------------------------

#### Data Location

* We are hosted by [LiquidWeb](https://www.liquidweb.com/) in the USA. Specifically, we use the Lansing, MI Data Center. All user data is located there.
* We also use [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) Spaces for our article media storage (https://uploads.golmedia.net). So you may see some media loading from there, that is also GamingOnLinux and first-party. This is essential for our operation.
* Comments and forum posts may also include external media from users from various media hosts (like imgur for example), we have a privacy box that you must accept to view this media as we do not control where it comes from.

What we store and how we use it
-------------------------------

* For the purpose of optional user registration, we store:
    * Your username.
    * Your email address. Your email address is never publicly visible.
    * Your IP address. Your IP address is never publicly visible.
* Further data may be collected if you choose to share it, such as if you fill out fields on your profile.
* We may at times store your IP address in our ban list, in case of spam or abuse. This is removed after 30 days.
* Anyone is free to permanently remove their user account at any time via the [User Control Panel](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/usercp.php?module=removeacc) where you can set it to be removed.

Our website server automatically collects and stores information in its server log files that your browser transmits to us. These are:

These log files are regularly deleted every month, this is also to prevent and deal with abuse and is essential to keep the website working.

Cloudflare
----------

We use Cloudflare for increased security, performance and analytics. You can see [their full Privacy Policy here](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/). Cloudflare may log your IP address, traffic routing data and system configuration information to help keep us online.

Cloudflare offers a globally distributed content delivery network with DNS. Technically, the transfer of information between your browser and our website is routed via the Cloudflare network. This enables Cloudflare to analyse traffic between your browser and our website and serve as a filter between our servers and potentially malicious traffic from the Internet. Cloudflare may also use cookies or other technologies to recognize Internet users, but these are used solely for the purpose described herein not to personally identify you.

The use of Cloudflare is based on our legitimate interest in providing our website as error-free and securely as possible.

Google Adsense
--------------

Some advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site. These cookies are generally used for geo-targeting purposes (like showing Wisconsin real estate ads to someone in Wisconsin, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You can opt out of personalised advertising from Google by visiting [Ads Settings](https://www.google.co.uk/settings/ads) and [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Changes to our Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

Suggestions
-----------

For additional privacy, we always recommend seeking out extra privacy plugins for your browser! Look out for Privacy Badger from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and uBlock Origin. They can help block tracking and malicious website scripts.

We also recommend [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for your search engine (instead of Google), as they don't track you. They also have handy "bangs" to search website directly, like ours! Simply enter "!gol" followed by your search term to search our site from DDG.
