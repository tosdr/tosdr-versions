* Order & Payment. When you make a purchase online, you will be re-directed to our commerce platform vendor. We do not receive your full credit card, debit card or other financial information when you make a payment- such information is provided directly to the vendor. However, we do receive information about your purchase and your contact information (e.g. name, credit card type, last four digits of your credit or debit card number, email address, mailing address, phone number). We will keep a record of your purchases. We may collect tax identification numbers you submit for tax-exempt purposes.
* Social Media. We are active on social media, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn ("Social Media"). Anything you post on Social Media is public information and will not be treated confidentially. We may post (or re-post) on our websites and Social Media pages any comments or content that you post on our Social Media pages. Your use of Social Media is governed by the privacy policies and terms of the providers that own and operate those websites and not by this Policy. We encourage you to review those policies and terms.

**Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies**. We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (collectively "Cookies") on our websites. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our websites may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.rcaantennas.net/cookie-policy/).

**Analytics**. We use analytics providers including Google® Analytics to collect and process information about your use of our websites. These analytics providers set cookies on your browser or device, and then your web browser will automatically send information to them. They use this information to provide us with reports that we use to better understand and measure how users interact with our websites.

We may also implement additional add-on services to Google® Analytics, such as:

* **Demographics and Interest Reporting**, which gathers information such as the age and gender of users, along with certain interests those users express through their purchasing activities and other online activities, by tracking users across websites and across time.
* **Remarketing with Google® Analytics**, which uses user behaviors on our Site and within our App to help us identify users for our remarketing campaigns.
* **Google® Display Network Impression Reporting**, which provides us information about how often our ads are shown.

To learn more about how Google® uses data, visit [Google's Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy) and Google's page on "[How Google® uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)." You may download the [Google® Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other analytics tools. To learn more about Google® Analytics cookies, visit [Google® Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage).

**Interest-based Advertising**. We use third parties and/or service providers for interest-based or targeted advertising services. These services may serve advertisements on our behalf that are customized based on predictions about your interests generated from your visits to websites (including our websites) over time and across different websites. The data collected may be associated with your personal information. These advertisements may appear on our websites and on other websites, and may be sent to you via email.

We use Google® Ads to serve ads across various websites. Google® uses Cookies to collect data about your visits to our websites to generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit. To opt-out of this type of advertising by Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google's collection or use of such data, visit [Google's Safety Center](https://www.google.com/safetycenter/tools) and [Google's Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) and follow [Google's personalized ad opt-out instructions](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en&ref_topic=7048998). Opting out will not affect your use of the websites.

To change your preferences with respect to certain online ads or to obtain more information about ad networks and online behavioral advertising, visit [National Advertising Initiative Consumer opt-out page](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program](https://www.aboutads.info/). Changing your settings with individual browsers or ad networks will not necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads. Opting-out of targeted advertising does not opt you out of all ads, just those targeted to you.

**Video Content**. Our websites contain videos and embedded content provided by VOXX International and other parties, including visible content and/or feeds scripts embedded in the websites' code. VOXX International and such other parties may collect data about how you interact with such content. For example, YouTube may collect usage data on videos embedded on the websites.

**Maps**. The websites contain maps provided by third parties and/or service providers to help you locate nearby dealers. We and such other parties may collect data about how you interact with the maps. For example, Google® may collect usage data on maps embedded on the websites. Even if you do not interact with the maps, Google®may still collect certain information about your interactions with our websites if you are signed into your Google® account when accessing our websites.

How to Exercise Your Rights of Access and Deletion. To exercise your California rights described in this Section, you may submit your request to us by contacting us at either of the following:

Email: [privacy@voxxintl.com](mailto:privacy@voxxintl.com)

Verifying Your Request. In order to verify your request, you must provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, and you must describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.

When we receive your request to exercise your rights under the CCPA: (a) we will acknowledge receipt of your request; (b) we will try to match the information you provide in making the request with information we already maintain about you; (c) if required to verify your identity, we may ask you to provide additional information, including personal information; (d) we will consider various factors when determining how to verify your identity, such as the sensitivity and value of the data, the risk of harm, the likelihood of fraud, etc.

When We Will Respond. We will try to respond to your request for access or deletion within 45 days. If we require additional time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information to you. We may charge a fee to process or respond to your request if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
