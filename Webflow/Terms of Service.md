================

Effective date: November 15, 2023  
Last modified date: November 15, 2023

1\. Welcome to Webflow!
-----------------------

### 1.1 Introduction

Thank you for visiting the websites and associated domains of [www.webflow.com](http://www.webflow.com/) (collectively, the “**Sites**”). Webflow is the world’s leading visual development platform for building powerful websites without writing code. To learn more about how Webflow works, visit [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/). To learn more about Webflow's brand, including tone of voice, audiences, and messaging, visit our [official brand guidelines](https://brand-at.webflow.io/).

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**'') govern your access to and use of the Sites and Platform. We've tried to keep the Terms as straightforward as possible, for example, by explaining some of the key concepts below in plain English to aid in your understanding (see the sidebar notes that all start with "Basically..."), but please note those explanations are not legally binding. If you have any comments or questions about these Terms, please [email us](mailto:contact@webflow.com) and let us know.

Subject to these Terms and during your Subscription Term (defined below), you may access and use Webflow’s software-as-a-service platform and the related web design technology products and services (e.g., the Webflow Designer, Dashboard, Workspace(s), Software, and Site Plans) that you access or subscribe to (collectively, the “**Platform**” or “**Webflow Platform**”) on a free, trial, or paid basis, as applicable.

> **HI THERE  
> ‍  
> ‍**Welcome to Webflow’s Terms of Service! In these white boxes, you'll find our plain-English Terms of Service. This part isn’t legally binding, so please use this column only as an aid when reviewing the legal language.

### 1.2 Applicable Terms

Your use of the Platform is subject to these Terms, as well as our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/aup), [Intellectual Property Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/copyright), [Trademark Usage Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/trademark-policy) and, if applicable, the [Product Specific Terms](https://webflow.com/legal/product-terms), [Template License Policy](https://webflow.com/templates/template-licenses), Marketplace Creator Agreement, [Developer Terms of Service](https://webflow.com/legal/developer-terms-of-service), [Data Processing Addendum](https://webflow.com/legal/dpa), [Beta Program Terms and Conditions](https://webflow.com/legal/beta-terms) and any applicable agreements or policies referenced therein (these documents are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference and together with these Terms are collectively referred to as the “**Agreement**”). Undefined capitalized terms used in these Terms have the meanings ascribed to them in the relevant agreement, policy, or addendum incorporated by reference into the Agreement.  As mentioned above, the sidebar notes are provided for convenience, are not part of these Terms or the Agreement, and have no legal effect.

If you have separately executed an Order Form (defined below) that is subject to Webflow’s Master Subscription Agreement (“**MSA**”), your access to and use of the Platform will be governed by the MSA rather than these Terms.

As pertains to the Platform, ( 1 ) the “**Effective Date**” of the Agreement is the earlier of the date of (a) your initial acceptance of these Terms (or Updated Terms, as applicable) and access to the Platform through any online provisioning, registration, or order process; or (b) the effective date of the first Order Form between you and Webflow referencing this Agreement; and ( 2 ) the “**Subscription Term**” of the Agreement shall be as of the Effective Date until you terminate your Account and/or the expiration or termination of the last outstanding Order Form, as applicable. As used herein, “**Order Form**” means the Webflow order form or related ordering document subject to this Agreement or an MSA, as applicable, that is signed by Webflow and you, and which specifies the products or offerings procured by you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, as pertains to the Sites, these Terms remain in full force and effect as of the “Effective as of” date above.

Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you are not permitted and may not use the Platform.

BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBFLOW PLATFORM OR ANY RELATED WEBFLOW OFFERINGS, YOU ARE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE THE PLATFORM OR ANY RELATED WEBFLOW OFFERINGS. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HEREBY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS THE FULL RIGHT, POWER, AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO AND PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, AND THIS AGREEMENT IS A VALID AND BINDING OBLIGATION ON SUCH PARTY.

IF YOU ARE USING OR ACCESSING THE PLATFORM OR ANY RELATED WEBFLOW OFFERINGS AS AN EMPLOYEE, CONTRACTOR, OR AGENT OF A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP OR SIMILAR ENTITY, THEN YOU MUST BE AUTHORIZED TO SIGN FOR AND BIND SUCH ENTITY IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO AND SHALL BE LIABLE TO WEBFLOW FOR ANY VIOLATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT BY YOU OR SUCH ENTITY. THE RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON ACCEPTANCE BY SUCH AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.

**SECTION 16 OF THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT SHALL GOVERN ANY CLAIMS THAT THE PARTIES MAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION.**

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> By accepting these Terms and using the Service, please understand you are also agreeing to the terms of our Acceptable Use Policy, Intellectual Property Policy, Trademark Usage Policy and, if applicable, the Product Specific Terms, Marketplace Creator Agreement, Developer Terms of Platform, Data Processing Addendum, and Beta Program Terms and Conditions.

### 1.3 Who is Who

The Sites and the Platform are provided by Webflow, Inc., a Delaware corporation located at 398 11th Street, Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103 (inclusive of our Affiliates (defined below), collectively referred to as “**Webflow**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”). As used in the Agreement, “**you**” or “**Customer**” means the individual or entity you are accessing the Sites or using the Platform on behalf of. As used herein, “**Affiliates**” means, with respect to a party, an entity that directly or indirectly controls (e.g., subsidiary), is controlled by (e.g., parent), or is under common control with (e.g., sibling) such party; and the term “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”) means either: (a) ownership or control of more than 50% of the voting interests of the subject entity; or (b) the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership, by contract, or otherwise.

2\. Your Account
----------------

### 2.1 Eligibility

The Platform is available only for individuals aged 13 years or older or the digital age of consent in your country, if older. If you are age 13 or older but under the age of 18, or the legal age of majority where you reside (if that jurisdiction has an older age of majority), then you agree to review these Terms with your parent or guardian to make sure that both you and your parent or guardian understand these Terms and you agree to have your parent or guardian review and accept these Terms on your behalf. If you are a parent or guardian and are agreeing to these Terms for the benefit of a child over the age of 13 (or the digital age of consent in your country, if older), then you agree to accept full responsibility for that child’s use of the Platform, including all financial charges and legal liability that they may incur. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Platform to any person or entity and change the eligibility criteria for using the Platform at any time. The right to access the Platform is revoked where the Agreement or use of the Platform is prohibited or to the extent any offer, sale, or provision of the Platform conflicts with any applicable law, rule, or regulation.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> You must be at least 13 years old (and have your parent's permission if you are under 18) to use Webflow.  
>   
> If you use Webflow on behalf of your business, you are representing that you are authorized to agree to these Term on its behalf.

### 2.2 Signing Up

To access and use the Platform, you must register for an account with Webflow (“**Account**”). To complete your Account registration, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep that information current so that we can communicate with you about your Account. We may need to send you notices about important updates (like changes to these Terms or our Privacy Policy), or to inform you of legal inquiries we receive about your use of the Platform so you can make informed choices in response. We encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid, current email address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the Account and/or Website Content (as defined below). Webflow reserves the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark to those usernames.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> You need to sign up for an Account to use Webflow. Choose a plan that works for you or for your company (if you're authorized to act on their behalf). If you set up an account through another service like Google, it’s OK for us to use your information as provided by that service.  
>   
> We may send you occasional emails about Webflow updates or your account.

### 2.3 Primary Email Address

You acknowledge that Webflow will use the email address you provide upon creating an Account or as updated by you from time to time as the primary method for communication with you (“**Primary Email Address**”). You must monitor the Primary Email Address you provide to Webflow and your Primary Email Address must be capable of both sending and receiving messages. Your email communications with Webflow can only be authenticated if they come from your Primary Email Address. If you lose access to your Primary Email Address, Webflow will not be able to authenticate your Account and you will permanently lose access to your Account (e.g. if you fail to renew your domain name and lose access to the associated email, Webflow will be unable to resolve the situation for you). Webflow will not be liable for any losses you suffer resulting from you losing access to your Primary Email Address pursuant to Section 12 of these Terms (“Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability”).

### 2.4 Your Responsibility for Your Account

Please safeguard your Account and make sure others do not have access to your passwords or other authentication credentials (e.g. multi-factor authentication credentials). Your Account and Primary Email Address are specific to you (or one designated person if on behalf of an entity) and may not be shared with or transferred to any other person. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and you will be held responsible for any harm caused by disclosing or resulting from any unauthorized use of your Account. You agree that will not permit any other person to use your Account, and you will immediately notify Webflow if you know or suspect that your Account has been used by any other person. You shall not use or access an Account which is not your own. You must exercise caution when accessing your Account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other authentication credentials. You are responsible for taking all steps to ensure that no unauthorized person shall have access to your Account or Primary Email Address. If anyone other than yourself accesses your Account, they may perform any actions available to you and make changes to your Account and Website Content. You are strictly prohibited from sharing your Account credentials, including usernames and passwords, with any third party or individual. Sharing account information is a violation of the Agreement and may result in immediate termination of your Account. You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for any third parties you may invite into any workspaces or sites that you own or administer. You agree that Webflow shall have no liability for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to maintain the security of your Account information.

If you are a [Webflow Expert](https://experts.webflow.com/browse), web design agency, solo web designer, or any other similarly situated third party that builds and designs websites on behalf of your clients (“**Website Designer**”), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to act as your clients’ agent and are accepting the Agreement on their behalf. You further agree that you will surface the Agreement to your clients. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account or password. If we believe your Account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it until such time that the matter has been resolved.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> Keep your password safe and let us know if you detect any unusual behavior on your account immediately. Use the settings to make any changes to your account or just contact us.

### 2.5 Conversion to an Enterprise Account

If you have separately executed an Order Form with Webflow, your access and use of the Platform will be governed by such Order Form. For clarity, an Order Form may be governed by the MSA or these Terms depending on the provisions of your Order Form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you convert your Account to an [Enterprise account](https://webflow.com/pricing#), your workspace(s) will be migrated to an [Enterprise account](https://webflow.com/pricing#) and will be subject to the terms of the Order Form starting from the date of the execution of the Order Form. If you intentionally or unintentionally add non-Enterprise website(s) (“**Self-Serve Websites**”) to your Enterprise workspace using a payment method other than the payment method specified in the Order Form, any Self-Serve Websites will be subject to the payment terms set forth in the Order Form and billed as Enterprise Site Plans once added to your Enterprise workspace.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> If you sign an Order Form with us, your use of the Platform will be governed by the terms of the Order Form.

### 2.6 Disputes

If there is a dispute about Account or Website Content ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership based on our reasonable judgment in our sole discretion. However, if we cannot make such a determination, we reserve the right to not intervene in the dispute, suspend any Account(s) involved in the dispute, and/or take down Website Content until the parties disputing ownership reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, trademark certification) that may assist us in determining ownership. Below is a non-exhaustive set of factors we will consider when determining proper ownership:

1. **2.6.1** Webflow will consider the owner of an Account as the person or entity who has access to the Primary Email Address for such Account.**‍**
2. **2.6.2** Webflow will consider the owner of Website Content as the person or entity who has access to the Primary Email Address for the Account under which such Website Content was created.
3. **2.6.3** For Accounts that have paid any Fees (defined below), Webflow may consider the owner of such Account and/or Website Content created thereunder to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to pay such Fees.
4. **2.6.4** Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Webflow deems that the circumstances justify, Webflow shall have the exclusive right to adjudicate the ownership dispute of an Account and/or Website Content in its sole discretion based on any information in its possession, including the factors set forth above.

### 2.7 Death or Inability to Contact Website Designer

If you are a client of a Website Designer and your Website Designer passes away or becomes otherwise unreachable, Webflow will be unable to transfer their Account and/or export the Website Content in their Account’s workspace to you. In such an event, Webflow will only be able to allow you to update the billing information related to the site to keep the site running. If you do not wish to update the billing information related to the site, the site will be removed if and when the billing information on file becomes inactive and payments fail after the grace period has elapsed.

3\. Your Website Content
------------------------

### 3.1 Uploading Website Content

If you have a Webflow Account, the Platform may enable you to, among other things, publish or upload content to the Internet, including but not limited to blogs or forum posts, images, photos, and videos. Any content you submit, post, display, or otherwise make available on or via the Platform, including all Intellectual Property Rights (defined below) therein, is referred to as your “**Website Content**.” For the avoidance of doubt, Website Content includes any [Templates](https://webflow.com/templates), [Libraries](https://webflow.com/libraries?utm_source=marketplace), or [Apps](https://webflow.com/apps?utm_source=marketplace) that you submit to the [Marketplace](https://webflow.com/marketplace). Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement and to the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to be fully responsible for the Website Content that you create or submit to the Platform and you further agree not to use the Platform to create or submit any Website Content that does not comply with the Agreement including but not limited to Webflow’s [Acceptable Use Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/aup).

Please note that any [Templates](https://webflow.com/templates), [Libraries](https://webflow.com/libraries), and/or similar offerings that you submit to the [Webflow Marketplace](https://webflow.com/marketplace) will be governed by the Marketplace Creator Agreement and any accompanying policies including but not limited to the [Template Submission Guidelines](http://webflow.com/templates/submission-guidelines). Additionally, please note that any [Apps](https://webflow.com/apps) you submit to the Webflow Marketplace will be governed by the [App Developer Terms](https://webflow.com/legal/developer-terms-of-service) and any accompanying policies referenced therein.

For the purposes of this Agreement, “**Intellectual Property Rights**” means all patent rights, copyright rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights, and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals, and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory, or other jurisdiction.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> You are solely responsible for the content you publish using Webflow, and by publishing any content you are confirming that the content does not violate these Terms, including our Acceptable Use Policy.

### 3.7 Removal of Website Content and Agreement to CSAM Scanning and Reporting

### 4.4 End Users

* **Roles.** For the purposes of this Agreement, Webflow is acting as a service provider to you, and you are a Customer of the Platform, regardless of whether you pay any Fees to use the Platform. Any natural persons accessing or using your Website Content are deemed your “**End Users**.” You agree that Webflow does not have a direct relationship with any of your End Users and Webflow is not responsible for how you process or otherwise handle any End User information. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for ( 1 ) providing any required notices and ( 2 ) obtaining all End User consents required under applicable laws.
* **Applicable laws.** You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in the Agreement, particularly if you or your End Users are located outside of the United States. Such obligations may be more restrictive than this Agreement. Use of the Platform does not ensure compliance with such laws, nor is Webflow responsible for your compliance with such laws.
* **Security safeguards.** You will use all reasonable efforts to protect information you collect via your use of the Platform. You are solely responsible for configuring and implementing security controls to properly manage and secure your website cookies, website headers, DNS configurations, and subdomains, as well all similarly related web attributes. In the event you discover that any information collected by you has been breached, compromised, or inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify Webflow promptly of such a breach or exposure including the root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future.
* **Security notification.** You are responsible for providing any required notices to your End Users, third parties, or authorities under any applicable data protection laws, data breach notification statutes, or other applicable laws or regulations.

Your notices and consent gathering must be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, before collecting or processing any End User Personal Information, you must provide adequate notice of the End User Personal Information you collect, how it will be used and/or shared, and obtain any necessary consents required under applicable marketing or data protection laws and regulations. You agree to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations in connection with your access and use of the Platform. You agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of data exported from the country in which you reside. You agree that you will respond to any End Users wishing to exercise their privacy rights, under applicable law, as it relates to any information collected via your use of the Platform. For example, if End Users located in certain jurisdictions exercise their “right to be forgotten” (or “erasure”) of their Personal Information that you have collected via the Platform, you shall comply with their request as required by applicable law. For clarity, you (the “data controller”) are directly responsible for the End User Personal Information you collect. By using the Platform, you are instructing Webflow (the “processor”) to process your End Users’ Personal Information. Webflow, as the “processor,” is not responsible for responding to End Users on your behalf. To the extent Webflow receives a request from an End User, regulator, or authority about your use of the Platform, Webflow will notify you in compliance with or as permitted by law. If applicable, Webflow shall process your End Users’ Personal Information in accordance with our [Data Processing Addendum](https://webflow.com/legal/dpa), which is hereby incorporated by reference.
* ‍**Notice.** You agree to provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your use of the Platform that: (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, (ii) is conspicuously displayed to all End Users, and (iii) clearly and accurately describes to End Users what information you collect (such as login information, contact form data, cookies, etc.) and how you use and share such information (including for marketing and advertising) with Webflow and other third parties.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> Webflow has no relationship to the end users or website visitors of the sites you build with Webflow, so we are not responsible for how you handle their information.  
> ‍  
> So you should make sure to protect the info you gather on your sites, let people know if their data may have been accessed in the event of a security breach, let your website visitors know what info you gather and how it will be used, get consent to said gathering and usage, publish a privacy policy that clearly and accurately describes the info you collect and how you’ll use it, and respond appropriately to users wishing to exercise their privacy rights, such as the right to be forgotten or have their data deleted.

### 4.5 Use of Software

To the extent you access or use any downloadable software related to the Platform (“**Software**”), such access or use shall be governed by the terms of the license agreement that accompanies the Software or is posted with the Software on the Sites where the Software can be accessed; however, if no such license agreement is made available, we grant you a limited, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and non-exclusive license to use the Software for your personal, noncommercial use in accordance with these Terms.

--------------

### 7.1 Important Things We Can Do

We reserve these rights, which we may exercise at any time and in our sole discretion, and without liability or notice to you (except where prohibited by applicable law): (a) we may change parts or all of the Platform and its functionality; (b) we may suspend or discontinue parts or all of the Platform; (c) we may terminate, suspend, restrict or disable your access to or use of parts or all of the Platform; (d) we may terminate, suspend, restrict or disable access to your Account or parts, some of, or all of your Website Content; (e) we may change our eligibility criteria to use the Platform (and if such eligibility criteria changes are prohibited by law where you live, we may revoke your right to use the Platform in that jurisdiction); and (f) we may monitor or scan your Website Content and/or Account for abusive, spammy, or similar malicious behavior and take appropriate actions including but not limited to removal of Website Content and suspension or termination of your Account.

### 7.2 Ownership Disputes

Sometimes ownership of an Account, workspace, Website Content, or website is disputed between parties, such as a business and its employees, or a web designer and a client. We try not to get involved in these disputes. However, we reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, and without notice to you, to determine the rightful owner and to transfer the relevant account, workspace, website Content, or website to the party we determine to be the rightful owner. Our decision in that respect is final. If we feel that we cannot reasonably determine the rightful owner, we reserve the right to suspend or disable an Account and its related Website Content until the disputing parties reach a resolution. We also may request documentation to help determine the rightful owner, including but not limited to a government-issued photo ID, credit card invoice, or business license.

8\. Billing, Payments, and Renewals
-----------------------------------

Customers may be required to provide their credit card details to Webflow or the payment service provider retained by Webflow (the “**PSP**”). Customers will be responsible for paying all applicable fees related to their use of the Platform (the “**Fees**”). You are solely responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes, including sales, use, VAT, or similar transaction taxes imposed on your paid subscription to the Platform, unless you provide Webflow with a valid tax exemption certificate (“**Taxes**”). All Taxes payable by you will be separately stated and exclusive of the Fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no liability for taxes that are statutorily imposed on Webflow, including taxes or fees based on Webflow’s net or gross income.

All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Your payments are processed by the PSP in U.S. Dollars on the date the transaction is processed. If you pay in a currency other than U.S. Dollars (“**Foreign Currency**”), your currency will be converted to U.S. Dollars at the current exchange rate set by the PSP. If you pay in a Foreign Currency and request a refund, you may receive a refund amount that differs from your original payment amount. If this occurs, Webflow will be unable to adjust the refund amount you received. The difference in payment and refund amounts is caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations outside of Webflow’s control.

Free accounts are not required to provide payment account information. We will immediately bill you upon any upgrade from a free plan to any paid plan.

For monthly payment plans, the Platform is billed in advance on a monthly basis. Any requests for refunds will be handled in accordance with [Webflow’s Billing and Refund Policy](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/webflow-billing#:~:text=Does%20Webflow%20provide%20refunds%3F,we%20understand%20mistakes%20sometimes%20happen) as updated by Webflow from time to time.

For annual payment plans, the Platform is billed up front for one (1) year subscription periods and is non-refundable. Your annual plan will automatically renew for successive one (1) year subscription periods, and you will be charged the applicable Fees on each annual anniversary of your purchase, unless you cancel the plan(s) on your Account prior to the end of the then-current annual term. There will be no refunds or credits for partial terms of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for unused terms with an active Account. Certain credits may apply when you purchase an upgrade to the Platform or switch from a monthly plan to an annual payment plan.

**Unless otherwise provided for in your Order Form, you can cancel your payment plan(s) by going into your dashboard, selecting plans, and then downgrading to a starter plan. For more information on how to cancel paid plans, please see** [**our help article here**](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/webflow-billing?topics=workspaces-billing#workspace-billing)**.**

If you have separately executed an Order Form, your access and use of the Platform will be governed by the terms of such Order Form. For clarity, an Order Form may be subject to these Terms or the MSA depending on the provisions of your Order Form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you convert your Account to an [Enterprise account](https://webflow.com/pricing#), your workspace(s) will be migrated to an [Enterprise account](https://webflow.com/pricing#) and will be subject to the terms of the applicable Order Form starting from the date of the execution of the Order Form. For the avoidance of doubt, you are expressly prohibited from adding non-Enterprise website(s) (“**Self-Serve Websites**”) to your Enterprise Workspace using a payment method other than the payment method specified in the Order Form, provided that if you (unintentionally or intentionally) add any Self-Serve Websites to your Enterprise Workspace, they will be subject to the payment terms set forth in the Order Form and billed as Enterprise Site Plans.

To the extent your use of the Platform exceeds the usage limits provided for in your payment plan (as set forth on [https://webflow.com/pricing](https://webflow.com/pricing)) or the applicable Order Form, including but not limited to the usage categories of monthly visits, bandwidth, and API requests per minute, Webflow reserves the right to charge you prorated overage fees for any such excessive use, require you bring your usage within the allotted parameters of your current plan, and/or require you upgrade to a new plan to increase your usage limits, in Webflow’s sole discretion. If you do not comply with such requirements within 30 days from Webflow’s initial written notice to you (email acceptable) regarding such excessive usage, Webflow may suspend or limit your access to the Platform, in whole or in part, for breaching the terms of your agreement with Webflow.

Unless you have separately executed an Order Form, we reserve the right to change our fees and to institute new charges at any time (including, for clarity, for any renewal), upon notice to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webflow in our sole discretion. Your use of the Platform following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased fees.

> **BASICALLY...  
> **  
> Like other products, some of our services are paid. You are responsible for payment for the services and associated taxes. Certain additional rules apply to Enterprise Customers.

9\. Privacy and Security

> Webflow is provided as-is. We try to make sure it works perfectly all the time, but if something happens to go wrong, please understand our liability is limited as you are using the Service at your own risk.  
>   
> (Oh, and we're sorry for the all-caps. Our lawyers made us do it.)

13\. Indemnification  

-----------------------

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Webflow (including its Affiliates and its and their members, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns) from and against any third-party claims, demands, proceedings, losses, liabilities, and all related costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees (collectively, “**Losses**”), arising from or relating to (a) your (or in the context of Website Designers, your clients’) use of the Platform, including but not limited to your Website Content, your use of [Additional Product Offerings](https://webflow.com/legal/product-terms), and any claims by, on behalf of or against your End Users); (b) your (or in the context of Website Designers, your clients’) violation or breach of these Terms or any obligations, representations, or warranties under this Agreement; (c) your violation or breach of any applicable laws, rules, or regulations or the rights or good name of any third party; (d) any claims from or by tax authorities in any country in relation to your E-Commerce Activities, including without limitation your sales to individual consumers (including distance sales) and other operations for which Webflow may be held jointly and severally liable.

> **BASICALLY...  
> **  
> As we have no oversight of what you publish using our platform, if someone brings a claim against Webflow related to your content or your use of the Service, you are obligated to pay for the cost of defending such claims and any losses or damages Webflow incurs.

14\. Changes to the Platform and Termination  

-----------------------------------------------

Webflow is constantly innovating and finding ways to provide our customers with new features and services. Therefore, we may, without prior notice, change the Platform, add features, stop providing the Platform or features of the Platform to you or to customers generally, or create usage limits for the Platform. We may permanently or temporarily terminate, downgrade, suspend, or prohibit your access to the Platform without prior notice if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of this Agreement or Webflow’s policies or guidelines. You may discontinue or terminate your use of the Platform at any time.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> Webflow reserves the right to update, change, or terminate the Service and/or your access to it for any reason in our sole discretion.

15\. Amendments, Notification Procedures, and Updates to the Agreement  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to modify, update, or change these Terms from time to time in the usual course of business (such modified Terms, the "**Updated Terms**"), so we encourage you to review this page periodically. Notwithstanding, when we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the effective date at the top of this page and provide you with reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. Webflow may provide such notifications to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, and/or through posting of such notice on the Platform. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you. You may be required to click-to-accept or otherwise agree to the Updated Terms, but in any event your continued use or access of the Platform after the effective date of the Updated Terms shall constitute your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms and any Updated Terms before using the Platform. Updated Terms will be effective as of the date specified in the effective date at the top of this page, and will apply to your use of the Platform from that point forward. If we update these Terms in a non-material manner after the effective date, we will update the last modified date at the top of this page. The previous Terms (or previously Updated Terms) will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the then-current Updated Terms. If you choose not to agree to these Terms or any future Updated Terms, you may not use or access (and must discontinue any use or access to) the Platform. Webflow is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> We may materially change or update the Terms from time to time in our usual course of business. If we do, we'll make sure to give you notice of any Updated Terms (e.g., we will post a note on our website or email you). Your continued access and use of Webflow after the Effective Date found at the top of the page shall constitute your acceptance of the updated terms.  
>   
> If we realize we forgot a punctuation mark somewhere or we need to make an immaterial change to some wording, we will update the Last Modified Date, so you can see the last time we touched the terms in any way. E.g. we will update the Last Modified date but will spare your inbox if our lawyers decide that they now prefer the word "regardless" over "notwithstanding."

16\. Dispute resolution  

--------------------------

### 16.1 INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS

To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“**Dispute**”), you agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon your written notice to Webflow. Your address for any notices under the Agreement is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Webflow. Webflow’s address for such notices is Webflow, Inc., 398 11th St., Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> We don’t want to fight. If something goes wrong, contact us and we'll try to amicably solve the problem. If that doesn’t work, we will figure it out in arbitration in San Francisco.

### 16.2 BINDING ARBITRATION  

If you and Webflow are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Platform (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“**AAA Consumer Rules**”), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Webflow will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Webflow may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

### 16.3 EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court located within the Central District of California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.

### 16.4 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING

You and Webflow agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Webflow and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND WEBFLOW ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Webflow otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.

### 16.5 LOCATION OF ARBITRATION

Arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California. You and Webflow agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Webflow agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

17\. US Economic Sanctions  

-----------------------------

You may not use the Platform if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you (i) are not located or residing in any country or territory subject to comprehensive US sanctions (currently Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Donetsk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, and Syria); (ii) are not listed on any United States list of prohibited or restricted parties, such as OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Persons List, or otherwise subject to US sanctions that would prohibit your access to or use of the Platform; and (iii) shall not use or allow access by any of your customers or potential customers (if applicable) to the Platform in any manner that may cause Webflow to violate US export controls and sanctions. We reserve the right to restrict or block your access, or access by any of your End Users, to the Platform and/or to terminate the Agreement at any time without notice if we determine, at our sole discretion, that such access may cause a violation or create unacceptable risk to us under export controls or sanctions.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> Webflow’s ability to provide the Service to you is subject to compliance with US sanctions that restrict or prohibit who or from where the Service can be accessed.

18\. Miscellaneous  

---------------------

### 18.1 Assignment

Neither you nor Webflow may assign, transfer, or sublicense this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that Webflow may assign the Agreement in its discretion (including applicable Order Forms) to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

### 18.2 Governing law, international use, and users

The Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.

The Platform is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. Although the Platform may be accessible worldwide, we make no representation that the Platform or the materials on the Platform are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States, and accessing the Platform from territories where its use is illegal is prohibited. Those who access or use the Platform from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Platform are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.

### 18.3 Entire agreement/severability

The Agreement represents the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter addressed herein and supersedes all prior to contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral. The Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and lawful assigns.

### 18.4 No waiver

Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provisions of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our rights to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

### 18.5 Attorneys’ and accountants’ fees, remedies

In any action to enforce the Term, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneys’ and accountants’ fees and costs.

You agree that Webflow's remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Webflow shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Webflow may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees.

No right or remedy of Webflow shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and expenses.

No instance of waiver by Webflow of its rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver.
