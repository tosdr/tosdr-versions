Cookie Policy
=============

Effective date: August 1, 2020

This Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains how Webflow, Inc. ("Webflow", "we", "us" and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies (like web beacons) when you visit any of our websites that link to this Cookie Policy (such as www.webflow.com) ("Websites").

It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect Personal Information or information that becomes Personal Information if we combine it with other information. In such cases, the Webflow [Global Privacy Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/privacy) will also apply, as will the [EU & Swiss Privacy Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/eu-privacy-policy), if applicable.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Policy have the meaning given them in our [Webflow Global Privacy Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/privacy) or our [Terms of Service](https://webflow.com/legal/terms).

> **HI THERE**  
>   
> Welcome to Webflow's Cookie Policy!If it was purely up to us, we'd made this policy all about giving out fresh-baked cookies every time you design something awesome in Webflow – but alas, we'll need to talk more about browsers than snickerdoodles in this particular policy.

What cookies are
----------------

A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer’s hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user’s computer and web browser and tailor web pages and/or login information to a user’s preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities on the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Sites and users of the Service. By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies do not give us access to your computer.

> **COOKIE ( N )**  
>   
> 1) a small flat or slightly raised cake  
> ‍  
> 2) a person of a specified kind _(a tough cookie)_3) a small file or part of a file stored on a World Wide Web user's computer, created and subsequently read by a website server, and containing personal information (such as a user identification code, customized preferences, or a record of pages visited)

The types of cookies Webflow uses
---------------------------------

There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. We use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off. We also utilize persistent cookies to make it easier to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> We use session cookies, persistent cookies, and pecan sandies. The names of two out of three of those are surprisingly clear.

Cookies on customer sites
-------------------------

We do not add any cookies to customer sites. The cookies described in this Policy only apply to Webflow’s own marketing and product pages, not websites that are created with Webflow or published via Webflow Hosting. Customers may make changes to their websites at their own discretion that may cause cookies to be added (for example, enabling Google Analytics, using a Facebook Like button, or adding custom code), but these changes are optional and not made by Webflow.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> We'd love to give you all the tasty kind of cookies, but we don't put the tracking kind on the sites you create or host with Webflow.

Third-party cookies
-------------------

Cookies set by us are called "first-party cookies," while cookies set by others are called "third-party cookies." A third-party cookie can recognize your device both when it visits our Services and when it visits certain other websites or mobile apps. Webflow does not control how third-party cookies are used, so you should check the website of a third-party cookie provider for more information about how they are used.

Both first-party and third-party cookies can serve many functions, including analytics, marketing, and advertising. For more information about how you can control advertising or analytics cookies, please see the relevant section below.

We do not track or respond to browser “Do Not Track” requests.

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> Third-party cookies are other people's cookies.  

Cookies and your Personal Information
-------------------------------------

Some cookies are associated with your account and Personal Information, while others are not. We generally treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑Personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information. If we combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, then the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.

> **BASICALLY...  
> **  
> Some cookies are completely anonymous, while some may contain your personal information.

Why Webflow uses cookies and similar tracking technologies
----------------------------------------------------------

Webflow uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enable functionality on its Services, and to assist with marketing its products and services to interested individuals. Cookies help us improve by telling us our Services are being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and overall ensuring you enjoy your browsing experience on our Services. The chart below explains how we generally use cookies.

**Category of use**

**Description**  

Authentication  

These cookies help us show you the right information by personalizing the Services to your account.  

Security

These cookies help us detect suspicious or malicious activity on our Services, and support other security features.  

Preferences and functionality  

These cookies allow our Services to recognize you and your preferences. For example, they can auto-fill a form for you, provide you with customized content, remember your application settings, and more.  

Advertising  

These cookies allow us to show you advertising about Webflow on and off the Services. They tell us whether you took an action after seeing one of our ads, such as signing up for a webinar or other event by Webflow. They also let our advertising partners know how well our ads are doing by measuring the ad’s success and the types of interactions people have with our ads.  

Research, performance, and analytics  

These cookies help us understand how well our Services are doing by measuring your interactions with our Services. We use insights from these cookies to improve on current Services, and to research and develop new Services, features, or products. They also help us use plugins on our Services that allow you to enjoy certain functions, such as sharing our pages on your social media accounts.  

Managing first-party cookies with your browser settings
-------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to control the first-party cookies on our Services, you can use your browser to enable, disable, or delete cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “Help,” “Tools,” or “Edit” settings). However, please be aware that if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of the Services and other parts of the Services may also not work properly.

Many browser manufacturers provide helpful information about cookie management, including, but not limited to:

* [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer)
* [Safari (Desktop)](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph21411?locale=en_US) or [Safari (Mobile)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)
* [Android Browser](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/54068?visit_id=0-636609690094718319-1197318149&hl=en&rd=1)
* [Opera](https://www.opera.com/help/tutorials/security/cookies/)
* [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/260971/description-of-cookies)

If you use a different browser, please refer to your browser’s documentation. You can also find out more about how to change your browser cookie settings at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

> **BASICALLY...**  
>   
> Browsers give you a lot of control over cookies, and you can tweak your settings to disable cookies. However, disabling some cookies will make it impossible to log into Webflow and use it properly.

Advertising and/or analytics cookies Webflow uses and how to control them
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use third-party advertising and analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to share offers with individuals who may be interested in our Services. The Services primarily use the following advertising and/or analytical tools, for which we include relevant privacy information and opt-out options:

* **Google Analytics and Google Adwords‍  
    ‍**Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). You may also [learn more about how Google collects and processes data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) specifically in connection with Google Analytics. You may prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
* **Amplitude  
    ‍**Amplitude’s use of information collected is set forth in its [Privacy Policy](https://amplitude.com/privacy).
* **Attribution  
    **Attribution's use of information collected is set forth in its [Privacy Policy.](https://www.attributionapp.com/privacy/)
* **Iterable  
    ‍**Iterable's use of information collected is set forth in its [Privacy Policy](https://iterable.com/trust/privacy-policy/).
* **Facebook Pixel and Remarketing Service  
    ‍**Facebook’s use of information collected is set forth in its [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20161129190620/https:/www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation). You may [opt out of Facebook’s interest-based ads](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/#568137493302217).
* **Segment  
    ‍**Segment’s use of information collected is set forth in its [Privacy Policy](https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/), which includes instructions for opt-out.
* **Disqus  
    **Disqus outlines its use of information collected in its [Privacy Policy](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy). You may also [opt out of Disqus personalization features](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/).

If you would like more information about cookies and targeted advertisements, please visit [https://www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/). In addition, if you would like to opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers, you may do so through the Digital Advertising Alliance ([http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/)), the Network Advertising Initiative ([http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1)), or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance ([http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). In addition, on your iPhone, iPad or Android mobile device, you can change your device settings to control whether you see online interest-based ads.

As described in our [Privacy Policy](https://webflow.com/legal/privacy), California consumers may use the Digital Advertising Alliance’s tool to send requests under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) for a web browser to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of that framework’s participating companies by accessing the DAA’s tool here: [https://www.privacyrights.info/](https://www.privacyrights.info/), or by downloading the DAA’s AppChoices mobile application opt-out here:  [https://www.privacyrights.info/appchoices](https://www.privacyrights.info/appchoices).  

The AppChoices app is not limited to opt-outs for CCPA purposes and may be used by anyone to limit the collection of cross-app data for interest-based advertising purposes by participating DAA member companies.

If you are a California resident and would like us to no longer share your personal iin relation to cookies and related technologies, you can opt-out by visiting the following web page: [**Do Not Sell My Info**](https://webflow.com/legal/ccpa-notice)**.**

Webflow's use of log files
--------------------------

Webflow gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes an anonymized internet protocol address as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, search terms, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.

> **ANYWAY...**  
>   
> Log as in record. Not Yule log.

Webflow's use of clear GIFs/web beacons
---------------------------------------

When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

> **ANYWAY...**  
>   
> That's web beacon, not bacon. Much as we'd all prefer the latter.

Changes to Webflow's Cookie Policy
----------------------------------

We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will endeavor to notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective, but will not be liable for any failure to do so. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.

> **BASICALLY...  
> **  
> If we change this policy, we'll let you know by cookiegram.
