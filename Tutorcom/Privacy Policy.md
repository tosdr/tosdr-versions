_Effective Date: June 4, 2024_

Tutor.com, Inc. and TPR Education, LLC d/b/a The Princeton Review (collectively, “we,” “us,” or “our”) take your privacy seriously and understand the importance of protecting your personal information. Therefore, this Privacy Policy provides information about our privacy practices. “Personal information” means, unless otherwise defined by applicable law, any information about, that identifies, that relates to, that is linked to or associated with, or that is reasonably linkable to or reasonably capable of being associated with an identified or identifiable individual. For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not apply to our employees, job applicants, and independent contractors.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms of Use for this Site.

**Availability of Anonymous Access**

Depending on the organization through which you access our online, on-demand tutoring programs, you can access the program through a guest account, an anonymous account, or a personalized account.

If you access the program through a guest account, we do not collect personal information such as your name or email address from you to create an account. Certain features of the program will not be available to you, such as voice or videos sessions, essay drop off review, or storage of past sessions.

If you access the program through an anonymous account, then the email address you used to create an individual account is only stored in our system as an un-recognizable “hash” of letters and numbers, using an irreversible encryption algorithm. Therefore, you will not receive email communication of any kind from us, and certain features of the program will not be available to you, such as voice or videos sessions and essay drop off review.

The benefit to a personalized account is to make available certain features of the service like:

* Making your sessions personal;
* Access to voice and, when generally available, video sessions, and essay drop off review;
* Storing all of your past sessions, so you can review them anytime; and
* Access to our mobile application.

Note to parents of children under the age of 13: You are welcome to contact us at (800) 411-1970 to review any personal information we have collected about your child.
