Hello! Zendesk is a service-first CRM company that builds software designed to improve customer relationships. We’ve developed this Privacy Notice (“**Notice**”) to explain to you how we collect, use, disclose, and store personal data.

**This Notice only applies when Zendesk is the Controller of personal data (example: Zendesk website visitors’ personal data and business-to-business contact data).** Zendesk is a Processor, not a Controller, of personal data that we process on behalf of our Subscribers when they use Zendesk products and Services. For clarity, this means that this Notice does not apply to Zendesk products and Services. If you have questions related to how a Zendesk Subscriber utilises your personal data, please contact them directly. We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our Subscribers. This Notice also does not apply to personal data about current and former Zendesk employees, job candidates, or contractors and agents acting in similar roles.

Although we have not "sold" or “shared” personal data for money in the past 12 months, we engage in routine practices with our Digital Properties involving third parties that could be considered a "sale" or “sharing” as defined under California law. We do not knowingly sell or share any personal data of minors under the age of 16 We do not collect or process “sensitive personal information”, as defined by California law, to infer characteristics about you. Zendesk only uses sensitive personal information consistent with the exceptions to the right to limit sensitive personal information.

**Financial Incentives**: We may offer a benefit or offering in exchange for you providing personal data, such as a discount or coupon to individuals who respond to a survey. As part of these surveys we may collect personal data, such as your name, contact information, preferences, experiences, beliefs, opinions, and other responses to the survey questions. Participation in surveys is governed by the applicable terms and conditions for the survey, which will describe any financial incentives associated with that survey and how to participate. The value of your data is the value of the offer presented to you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit. You may withdraw from any financial incentive at any time by emailing us at [privacy@zendesk.com](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com). If we offer another type of financial incentive, we will share with you the material terms of each offer when we ask you to participate.

**b. Your Data Protection Rights:**  
Subject to legal limitations, certain California residents may have the below rights.

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to request information about the categories of personal data we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the personal data, the purposes for collecting the personal data, the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your personal data, and the purpose for which we disclosed your personal data (“**Categories Report**”). You may also request information about the specific pieces of personal data we have collected about you (“**Specific Pieces Report**”).
* **Right to Delete.** You have the right to request that we delete personal data that we have collected from you.
* **Right to Correct.** You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data that we maintain about you.
* **Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.** We do not sell personal data to third parties in exchange for money. However, as we explain in [Section 5](#cookies-and-tracking-technologies), we share information with advertising partners and allow advertising partners to collect information from our Digital Properties. This exchange may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under California law, and you have the right to opt out of this “sale” or “sharing” of personal data.

California residents may request to exercise the Right to Know, the Right to Delete, and the Right to Correct by using our [webform](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com) or by emailing us at [privacy@zendesk.com](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com). We will not discriminate against you, in any manner prohibited by applicable law, for exercising these rights.

**How to Fully Exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing:** In order to fully exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing with respect to any "sale" or “sharing” of information, you must undertake both of the following steps:

1. Submit a Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request using our [webform](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com); and
2. Disable the use of advertising cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our website footer. You must complete this step on each of our Sites from each browser and on each device that you use. These steps are necessary so that we can place a first-party cookie signalling that you have opted out on each browser and each device you use.
    

If you block cookies, we will be unable to comply with your Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing request for device data that we automatically collect and disclose to third parties online using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. If you clear the cookies in your browser, you will need to follow Step 2 above again. To the extent required by California law, we will honour “Do Not Sell or Share” opt-out preference signals sent in a format commonly-used and recognised by businesses at the browser level, such as an HTTP header field or JavaScript object.

**Verification:** To process California data protection requests, we will need to obtain information to locate you in our records or verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request. In most cases, we will request information about you, which may include your name, email address, or other information. If you submit a Right to Know “Specific Pieces Report”, we may also request a signed declaration, under penalty of perjury, that you are who you say you are. We may request alternative information under certain circumstances and/or use third parties to help verify your identity.

**Authorised Agents:** Authorised agents may exercise California data protection rights on behalf of California individuals, but we reserve the right to verify the individual’s identity directly as described above. Authorised agents must contact us by submitting a request through our [webform](mailto:privacy@zendesk.com) and indicate that they are submitting the request as an agent. We may require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on your behalf by providing signed permission from you. We may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorised agent permission to submit the request.

**Timing:** We will process Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing requests within fifteen business days from the date we received the request. We will respond to Requests to Delete and Requests to Know within forty-five days unless we need more time, in which case we will notify you, and it may take up to ninety days to respond to your request.
