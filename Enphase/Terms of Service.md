### 13\. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold Enphase, our affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and other users, harmless from and against any and all loss, cost (including attorneys’ fees), liability, damage, and expense arising from or relating to any claim or demand made by any third party (including other users) arising out of or related to (i) your use of any of the Websites, Services, or Website Content, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of any third party or (ii) Your Content.

### 14\. Release

To the extent permitted under applicable law, you hereby release Enphase from any liability related to: (i) any incorrect or inaccurate Website Content, whether caused by any user of any Service or Website or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Services or in the provision of the Websites; (ii) the conduct, whether online or offline, of any user of any Service or Website; (iii) any problems or technical malfunction of any telephone network or lines, computer online systems, servers or providers, computer equipment, software, failure of email or Website Content on account of technical problems or traffic congestion on the Internet or at any Website, or combination thereof, including injury or damage to any person’s computer related to or resulting from participating or downloading materials in connection with the Services or Websites; (iv) any loss or damage caused by or in reliance upon any Website Content or content transmitted by and to users, or any interactions between users of any Service or Website, whether online or offline; and (v) any error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, communications line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, or alteration of, any Website, Service, or user communication.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

### 15\. Copyright Policy

It is our policy to remove, or disable access to, material that infringes any copyright after we have been notified by the copyright owner or the copyright owner’s legal agent. If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on any Website or made available through the Services in any way that constitutes copyright infringement, please see the instructions at [enphase.com/dmca](https://enphase.com/legal/dmca).

### 16\. Changes

These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if Enphase makes any substantial changes to these Terms, we will notify you by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Websites or sending you an e-mail to the address that you provided for your Account. Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Websites. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of the Websites or Services. If you do not agree to the changes, you must cease your use of the Websites and Services. By using any of the Websites or Services, you agree to be bound by any such changes and, therefore, you should periodically visit the Websites to examine the then-current Terms. Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating any e-mail address that you have provided to us for your Account. If the e-mail address you have provided to us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.

### 17\. Arbitration Agreement

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or relating to, these Terms or your access or use of the Websites or the Services, shall be submitted to mandatory, final, and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (ii) you or Enphase may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).

Arbitration Rules and Forum. For any dispute, claim, or controversy with Enphase in connection with the Websites or the Services, you shall first contact Enphase at [legal@enphaseenergy.com](mailto:legal@enphaseenergy.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If the dispute has not been resolved after sixty (60) days, both parties shall resolve such dispute through binding arbitration under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”). JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The existence, content and result of the arbitration shall be held in confidence by all participants. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, appointed in accordance with the JAMS rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in English and in Santa Clara County, California. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Enphase will pay them for you. In addition, Enphase shall reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of the parties. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon the you and Enphase.

Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND ENPHASE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, OR OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Enphase are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in sections above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS; ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then such claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in San Francisco, California. All other claims shall be arbitrated.

30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Enphase Energy, Inc., 47281 Bayside Parkway, Fremont, California, 94538, attention: General Counsel, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. You may also opt-out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to the following email address: legal@enphaseenergy.com. Your notice must include your name and address, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

Severability. Except as provided above, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect.

Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Enphase.

### 18\. Miscellaneous

These Terms and any action related to these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of the law of a different state or jurisdiction. These Terms and any additional terms and conditions presented to you by Enphase on the applicable Website or in connection with the applicable Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and Enphase regarding your use of the Websites and Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. As used in these Terms, the word "including" means "including but not limited to." You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any United States technical data acquired from us, in violation of United States export laws or regulations. Neither the rights nor obligations arising under these Terms are assignable by you, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect. We may assign this Agreement without restriction.

### 19\. Important information for South Australian and Western Australian homeowners

Under the new standards issued by the Department of Energy and Mining, Government of South Australia and the relevant regulatory authorities in Western Australia (including but not limited to Energy Policy WA (each being “**Technical Regulator**”), generating systems connecting to the South Australian or Western Australian distribution network (as applicable) must be capable of being remotely disconnected and reconnected by an agent registered with the Technical Regulator (such agent being a “**Relevant Agent**”, and such new standards being the “**Remote Connectivity Standards**”). Under the Remote Connectivity Standards, if you are: (i) located in an area; and (ii) own and operate a PV System to which the Remote Connectivity Standards apply, you must appoint a Relevant Agent to manage the requirements under the Remote Connectivity Standards.

**Western Australia** **:** To maintain the stability of the electricity system and support the continued installation of rooftop solar, the WA State Government is introducing Emergency Solar Management. This is the capability to remotely turn off (and on again) new/upgraded residential rooftop solar systems with an inverter capacity of 5kW or less. This can be achieved in two ways – API cloud solution or metering solution. By using Enphase Products as part of your system, and to the extent that the Remote Connectivity standards apply, you agree to make your system available to Synergy for the purposes of Emergency Solar Management. Homeowners are responsible for ensuring that their systems can be remotely managed, in line with the terms of their DEBS agreement with Synergy. Households should discuss the emergency solar management requirements with their chosen solar installer and can also find more information at [synergy.net.au/global/dpv-management](https://www.synergy.net.au/global/dpv-management).
