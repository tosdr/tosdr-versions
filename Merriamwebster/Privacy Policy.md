Introduction
------------

Your privacy is important to us. We understand that you are aware of and care about your own personal privacy interests, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Policy sets forth your privacy rights and applies to personal information we may collect through our websites, mobile applications or online services that link to this Privacy Policy (our “Services”); how we will use, disclose and protect this information; and how you can opt out of some of our uses and disclosures of your information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that we collect in other ways, such as over the phone, by mail or in person, except where state otherwise or as required by law.

Your decision to use the Services and provide your personal data is voluntary. We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of personal data are requested. You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy) and [Your Rights & Choices](#toc5) below for more information), but that may limit the services Merriam-Webster is able to provide to you.

The Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect personal data from, minors under 16 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide personal data through the Services. Please see [COPPA Compliance](#tocCOPPA) below for more information.

We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.

Cookie Notice & [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Services use cookies, which are small data files that are placed on the hard drive of your computer, tablet, smartphone, or other devices when you visit a website and other tracking tools on our website and digital platforms. When we refer to cookies, this includes other similar technologies such as pixel tags, or web beacons. For more information about these tools and your choices, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy), [Use of Our Services - Information Collected Automatically & Other Information](#toc4) and [Your Rights & Choices](#toc5) below.

COPPA Compliance
----------------

In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age without the consent of their educational institution or the child's parent or guardian. We do, however, use COPPA-compliant, third party services that automatically collect or share certain information and usage data with us to support our internal operations as described under [How we use your information](#tocHowWeUse) and [Puku third-party service providers](#tocPukuThirdParty) below.

If an educational institution with students that are under thirteen (13) years of age uses our [Merriam-Webster Unabridged](http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/) Service, the educational institution also may provide us with personally identifiable information about its students. We use student information to provide this Service to the educational institution and its students, consistent with our Merriam-Webster Unabridged [Privacy Notice.](http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/info/privacy-policy.html)

If you believe that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 13, please contact us at: [privacy@m-w.com](mailto:privacy@m-w.com).

How We Collect & Use Your Personal Information
----------------------------------------------

Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to the Services by limiting the collection of personally identifiable information. Personal information provided by you to us will not be posted or published by us for viewing by third parties. In most cases, the information you provide is limited to first name, last name, email address, city, state, age, and phone number. We use this information to provide you with goods and services, including subscription services, publications, and the like. We do not sell personal information to anyone and only share it with third parties who are facilitating the delivery of our Services as provided in this Privacy Policy. You can enjoy many of our Services and their unique features without giving us your personal information.

* #### Subscriptions, User Login Registrations, and Mobile App Services
    
    When you subscribe to or register for a Service or download a mobile app service, we collect information about you that may include (but not be limited to) your name, email address, city, state, and age. We may also collect a personal mailing address and a phone number. Users may edit their information at any time to change, add or remove certain personal information. We process your personal information to administer and manage your subscription or other-like Service, deliver user benefits to you, inform you of prizes and other benefits or opportunities associated with your Service and respond to your information requests. We also may use this information for legitimate business purposes that help us analyze the demographics of our subscribers and understand our users' needs and interests to better tailor our products and services to meet users' needs and deliver additional services to our users. See also [The Puku Privacy Notice](#tocPuku) below.
    
* #### Promotions, sweepstakes, contests, and other special features
    
    For specific promotions, sweepstakes and contests sponsored or co-sponsored by us, and to access certain features, such as the ‘save your words' feature, we collect information voluntarily submitted by you to us to deliver the requested feature that may include (but not be limited to) your name, email address, city, state, and age. You may edit this information at any time to change, add or remove it from our Services.
    
* #### Newsletters
    
    To register for or subscribe to receive a Merriam-Webster newsletter, you must provide us with your email address. We use [Autopilot by Ortto](https://ortto.com/privacy/) and [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), our third-party service providers, to deliver requested newsletters, such as Word of the Day, to you on our behalf. When you open an email that contains a newsletter, we gather certain statistics, such as number of emails opened and clicks within a newsletter, using industry-standard technologies, including clear gifs, helping us monitor and improve our newsletters. For more information, please see [Autopilot's Privacy Policy](https://ortto.com/privacy/) and [Salesforce's Privacy Statement](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/). Except for Autopilot and Salesforce, we do not share your voluntarily provided email address with any third party.
    
    You may manage your Merriam-Webster newsletter subscriptions by subscribing or unsubscribing at any time using the link included in the related email. Please note that if you have set your browser to block cookies, this may have an impact on your ability to unsubscribe. If you have any difficulties managing your email or other communication preferences with Merriam-Webster, please contact us at [privacy@m-w.com](mailto:privacy@m-w.com).
    
* #### Communications from our approved, third-party partners and us
    
    If you choose to provide us with your email address or other personal information, you also may receive the following types of emails from us:
    
    * Emails related to subscription-maintenance activities;
    * Emails highlighting new features, content, and usage tips for the Services; and
    * Special offers and other marketing messages
        * From us for additional Merriam-Webster and Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and services, and
        * From our approved, third-party partners, if you "opt in" or give us your permission to send them.
    
    When you provide us with your personal information, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive special offers from Merriam-Webster or its third-party partners. Also, each special offer will have information available to allow you to "opt out" if you no longer wish to receive special offers. We may use [Autopilot](https://ortto.com/privacy/) or [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) to deliver emails to you on our behalf. When you open an email from us, we may gather certain statistics, such as number of emails opened and clicks within the email, using industry-standard technologies, including clear gifs, helping us monitor and improve our Services. For more information, please see [Autopilot's Privacy Policy](https://ortto.com/privacy/) and [Salesforce's Privacy Statement](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/). Except for Autopilot and Salesforce, we do not share your voluntarily provided email address with any third party.
    
* #### Surveys
    
    We may occasionally conduct online surveys. All surveys are voluntary, and you may decline to participate.
    
* #### Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you
    
    As explained above, Merriam-Webster processes your data to provide you with the products and services you have requested or purchased from us, including special features, subscriptions, newsletters, and other content. Sometimes we use third-party providers or work with co-sponsors to facilitate the delivery of the services or special features described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to your personal information for the sole purpose of providing services to you on our behalf, such as Word of the Day or delivering the special feature. Also, we may disclose your personal information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.
    
    To carry out these activities, Merriam-Webster may rely on many legal bases to process your personal data, including where:
    
    * necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Service and to provide the requested Services to you;
    * necessary for a third party's, or our, legitimate interests;
    * necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims;
    * necessary to protect the public interest or vital interest of others;
    * you have expressly made information public; or
    * you have consented to the processing, which may be revoked at any time.
    
    We also use your data for legitimate business purposes that enable us to refine our products and services to better tailor them to your needs, communicate with you about other products and services offered by Merriam-Webster, secure your personal data, or comply with regulatory and legal obligations.
    
    You can update your personal information and change your marketing preferences at any time by sending an email to [privacy@m-w.com](mailto:privacy@m-w.com).
    
* #### Payment card information
    
    You may choose to purchase goods or services from Merriam-Webster using a payment card. Typically, payment card information is provided directly by users, via the Services, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the Merriam-Webster subscribes, and Merriam-Webster does not, itself, process or store your card information. We strongly encourage you not to submit this information by email. When Merriam-Webster employees receive payment card information from users by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as instructed and then deleted or destroyed.
    

Links to Third-Party Websites or Apps
-------------------------------------

You may find advertising or other content on the Services that link to websites, apps, products, or services belonging to our third-party partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties, or offer content, functionality, or apps developed and maintained by third parties not controlled by Merriam-Webster. These third-party linked websites, apps, products, services and advertisements may use automated means to collect information about you and your use of these features. Merriam-Webster provides these links solely as a convenience to you. Merriam-Webster does not control and is not responsible for the practices employed by websites, apps, products, services, or advertisements linked to or from the Services. Therefore, Merriam-Webster disclaims liability for any information, materials, products or services offered at any third-party website linked to or from the Services.  Such third-party websites, apps, products, or services may have terms and conditions (as well as privacy policies) that are different from those set forth here.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the activities of Merriam-Webster’s third-party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners that may collect your user information while you access or use such third party’s services in connection with your use of the Services (e.g., social media and sharing services). Merriam-Webster is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party linked services once you leave the Services, click an advertisement or sign up for a special offer. We encourage you to read and review the privacy statement of each third-party service that you may choose to use, and we urge all users of our Services to follow safe internet practices: _Once you leave the Merriam-Webster Services, do not supply personal data to these third-party linked services unless you have verified their security and privacy policies._

Use of Our Services - Information Collected Automatically & Other Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like other commercial websites, Merriam-Webster and our authorized partners use cookies (small files transferred from a website to its users' hard drives or browsers for record-keeping purposes), including strictly necessary, performance, functional, and personalization cookies, software logs, and other similar information gathering technologies throughout our Services to collect certain information automatically and store it in log files to monitor the use of the Services, gather non-personal informational about our users, and for a variety of other legitimate business interests and purposes. This information may include (but is not limited to) internet protocol (IP) addresses, mobile device identifiers, the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), operating system (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), your internet provider (for example, Comcast), and other usage information about your use of our Services, including a history of the pages you view.

We may work with DigiTrust to set a cookie (DigiTrust Cookie) in your browser to enable us to collect web-viewing data that includes visits to a Merriam-Webster service and other non-affiliated websites over time.

We also may work with third-party analytics providers, ad networks, and advertisers in order to track your online activities over time and across third party websites, apps and devices, by obtaining information through the automated means (including cookies) mentioned above. The information received by us through these automated methods may include (but is not limited to) information about your activities across unrelated websites and mobile applications, information about the possible relationships between different browsers and devices, information that we receive from our third-party service providers, demographic data, information from social media providers, and information about your interests. We may add this information to the data we have already collected through our Services.

Please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy) and [Your Rights & Choices](#toc5) below for more information.

* #### Purposes for processing (using) information collected automatically & other information
    
    We may use and disclose information collected automatically through our Services and other information for any purpose, except if it is considered personal data under applicable law. If we combine information collected automatically with the personal data provided by you, we treat the combined information as personal data and use it only in the manner described above. See [Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you](#purposes1) above.
    
    On the basis of legitimate interests, we use this information (or combined information) to help us design our Services to better suit our users' needs, to provide and improve our Services, for identification verification, to provide support, for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns, for analytic purposes through tools such as Google Analytics, and to personalize your experience by presenting content, products, and offers tailored to you. This information, along with other information we gather when you login, also can be used to understand use across websites and devices to further improve our Services and show you advertisements on the Services or other third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests and enable us to offer the Services to you free of charge. We also may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Services, analyze trends, track user movements and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying user preferences.
    

* #### Relevant content and recommendations
    
    We use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reporting, which is a Google Analytics Advertiser feature that collects and stores standard internet log and user information on our behalf and gathers information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit. This Google Analytics data is not tied to personal information, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. For our legitimate business interests, we use the data provided by Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reports to develop our services and content around our user demographics, interests, and behavior on our Services.
    
* #### Advertising and interest-based, behavioral advertising
    
    To provide you with premium content, free-of-charge, Merriam works with third-party service providers to display advertising, including interest-based or behavioral advertising, on the Services.
    
    We participate in the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework and comply with its [Specifications and Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/). Our Consent Management Platform (CMP) is OneTrust LLC with the CMP identification number 28.
    
    In addition, some of the pages on the Services may be affiliated with CMI Marketing, Inc., d/b/a Raptive ("Raptive") for the purposes of placing advertising on the Services, and Raptive will collect and use certain data for advertising purposes. Raptive's CMP is LiveRamp with the CMP identification number 3. To learn more about Raptive's data usage and your related rights, click here: [Raptive's Advertising Privacy Statement](https://cafemedia.com/publisher-advertising-privacy-policy/).
    
    We also may rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this: **e820bb4aba5ad74c5a6ff1aca16641f6**) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers – doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.  Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies (‘LiveRamp’). IX and LiveRamp may use our first-party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser. You have the choice to opt out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.  Please find more information about opting out [below](#toc5).
    
    Since our Services are provided to you free of charge, we have a legitimate business interest in monetizing the delivery of our premium content to you on the Services through the display of advertising. To the extent required by applicable law or contractual obligations, we obtain your consent before using your information for interest-based, behavioral advertising – please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy).
    
    Merriam-Webster does not provide any personal information to third-party ad networks or advertisers about visitors to the Services, however these third parties may use automated means, such as cookies, to collect information, which may include your IP address, directly from you when you use our Services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you on the Services or other websites or the use of data that you provide directly to such third-party partners; that usage is governed by the third-party partner's privacy policy. For information about opting out of interest-based, behavioral advertising, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy) and [Your Rights and Choices](#toc5) below.
    
* #### Mobile device identifiers
    
    When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more "device identifiers," which are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may deliver information to a third-party partner or us about how you browse and use the Services. Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. For more information, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy) and [Your Rights and Choices](#toc5) below
    
* #### Anonymous aggregated data
    
    We may provide anonymous aggregated data to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes.
    

Your Rights & Choices
---------------------

Please read our [Cookie Policy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy), which more fully describes the cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies used on the Merriam-Webster Services and includes a “[Cookie Settings](https://www.merriam-webster.com/cookie-policy#cookie-settings)” button that explains each cookie category and enables you to opt-out of certain cookies, such as personalization cookies, which are related to interest-based advertising.

* #### Browser controls
    
    You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services. For more information about cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way.
    
* * To manage or delete browser cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings.
    * To manage or delete Flash cookies, please use the Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager here: [http://​www.macromedia.com/​support/​documentation/​en/​flashplayer/​help/​settings\_manager07.​html](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)

* #### Google Analytics Ad Settings
    
    You can opt-out of this Google Analytics Advertiser feature using the Ads Settings located at [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). You also can use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to disable tracking by Google Analytics. To delete these cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings or follow the above instructions.
    

* #### IX & LiveRamp
    
    You can control the use of your personal data by IX and LiveRamp as follows:
    
    * IX's options for users to opt-out of personalized advertising can be found on the IX website at this link: [https://​www.indexexchange.com/​privacy/](https://www.indexexchange.com/privacy).  IX may continue to add opt-out options.
    * To opt out of LiveRamp's use of your personal data, please head here: [https://liveramp.com/opt\_out/](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/).

* #### Interest-based, behavioral advertising opt-out choices
    
    You can exercise choice about the collection of data for interest-based, behavioral advertising, including by DigiTrust, by visiting the [Digital Advertising Alliance's choice page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and opting out from DigiTrust. Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier. Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners.
    
    Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an "opt-out" cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. Please know:
    
* * **If you opt-out of interest-based, behavioral advertising you will continue to receive ads on our free, ad-supported Services, but not behaviorally targeted ads**. Also, if you opt out of Merriam-Webster's practices, you may continue to receive interest-based, behavioral advertising through other companies.
    * If you erase your browser's cookies, you may need to perform this process again.
    * If you would like to learn more about interest-based, behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt-out of receiving interest-based, behavioral ads from them at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).
    * If you would like to avoid all advertisements on our Services, sign up for a paid-for subscription service or upgrade your mobile application.
* You also can opt-out of interest-based, behavioral advertisements on the Services by Merriam-Webster (and other companies employing online advertising) via the following options:
    
    * [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)
    * [Digital Advertising Alliance Canada](http://www.youradchoices.ca/)
    * [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)
    * [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

How we respond to “Do Not Track” signals
----------------------------------------

When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tool such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider. This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Merriam-Webster does not currently respond to DNT signals.

Children's Privacy
------------------

**A note to minors:** If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services, including [Puku](#tocPuku), or sending any email to us. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible.

Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Merriam-Webster has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at [privacy@m-w.com](mailto:privacy@m-w.com).

Puku Privacy Notice

* #### Children's Online Privacy Protection
    
    To respect your and your child's privacy, Puku collects the minimum amount of information necessary to operate and provide Puku's services to you and your child. In addition, we have taken steps to ensure that Puku complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For example, we do not use Puku to collect personal information (as broadly defined by COPPA) without a parent or guardian's consent or for purposes of online behavioral advertising. We do, however, use COPPA-compliant, third party services that automatically collect or share certain information and usage data with us to support our internal operations as described under [How we use your information](#tocHowWeUse) and [Puku third-party service providers](#tocPukuThirdParty) below.

    * #### Information you provide about yourself or your child.
