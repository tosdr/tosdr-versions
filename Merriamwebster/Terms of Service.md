**Merriam-Webster, Incorporated (“Merriam-Webster”)**  
_Terms of Use for Website, Mobile Application and Online Services_

Last Updated and Effective as of: October 23, 2024

Unless other terms and conditions or agreements with Merriam-Webster expressly govern, these Terms of Use govern your use of our websites, mobile applications or online services that link to these Terms of Use (collectively, the "Services"). Please note, these Terms of Use are subject to and incorporate the terms of all other legal notices that appear on the Services, including our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/i/privacy-policy), which describes how we process the data we collect from our Services.

Unless otherwise provided in a written agreement with Merriam, your use of the Services constitutes your agreement to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, please do not use the Services. Merriam reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Use at any time. If we make any material changes to these Terms of Use that impact your rights, we will notify you by email (sent to the email address in your account) and by a notice on the Services prior to the effective date of such changes with an opportunity for you to review the same, unless otherwise required by applicable law. All non-material amended terms automatically will take effect when they are posted on the Services. Please check this page periodically for any modifications. Your continued use of any of the Services following the posting of any non-material changes to these Terms of Use shall mean that you have accepted those changes. All other amended terms will take effect 30 days after you are notified of the same.

THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN [DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES](#disclaimers), [LIMITATION OF LIABILITY](#lim-of-liability), [GOVERNING LAW & VENUE](#governing-law) AND [CLASS ACTION WAIVER](#class-action) PROVISIONS. THESE PROVISIONS AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH MERRIAM-WEBSTER. PLEASE READ THEM.

Merriam-Webster offers three types of access to its Services: (1) advertising-supported; (2) individual and family consumer subscriptions; and (3) institutional subscriptions. [Section 1](#section-1) of these Terms of Use applies to all individuals who use our Services, both advertising-supported and subscription-based. [Section 2](#section-2) applies only to individuals with consumer subscriptions. [Section 3](#section-3) applies only to individuals who are Authorized Users under institutional subscriptions. [Section 4](#section-4)\-Legal Notices-applies to everyone.

Section 1. Terms of Use for Everyone
------------------------------------

**COPPA Compliance:** In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age without the consent of their educational institution or the child's parent or guardian. If an educational institution with students that are under thirteen (13) years of age uses our Services, the educational institution also may provide us with personally identifiable information about its students. We use student information to provide the Services to the educational institution and its students, consistent with our [Merriam-Webster Unabridged Privacy Notice](https://www.merriam-webster.com/i/privacy-policy).

**Links to Third-Party Websites; Affiliate Marketing Links:** The Services may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites. Our Services also may contain affiliate marketing links, which means we may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases from a third-party merchant whose products or services we write about. Our editorial content is not influenced by advertiser or affiliate- marketing relationships. When you purchase products or services from third-party merchants through affiliate marketing links on our Services, you are purchasing directly from the third- party product or service provider, not from Merriam-Webster. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any third-party merchant (including the content of their websites, their website availability, or their product or service pricing). In addition, Merriam-Webster does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, or content of any third-party merchant. These third parties may have their own terms and privacy policies, which you should review carefully.

**User Login:** To use our mobile-application Services or access certain features of our Merriam-Webster Online (www.Merriam-Webster.com) Service, including the 'Save Word' and 'Game' features, you will have to register with us by providing your email address and creating a username and password. When registering your account, please create a username that you like and will find easy to remember. We do not allow usernames that include profane or obscene language, third-party trademarks, email or web addresses, or the words "Merriam-Webster," and your username must comply with our [Username Policy.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/username-policy)

Once registered with us, please go to 'Settings' if you prefer to turn off the 'recent lookup' feature associated with your account. If you want to delete the email and all other information associated with your account, please email us at [customerservice@merriam-webster.com](mailto:customerservice@merriam-webster.com).

Our information collection and use policies with respect to the privacy of personal information provided by you when registering with us are set forth in our [Privacy Notice](https://www.merriam-webster.com/i/privacy-policy). You acknowledge and agree that between you and Merriam-Webster, you are solely responsible for the accuracy and content of your personal information, and agree to keep it up to date.

**Ownership**: The content on the Services is the property of Merriam-Webster and its affiliated companies or licensors, and is protected by international copyright, patent, and trademark laws.

**Advertising**: Advertisements, promotions, and marketing messages may appear on the Services from time to time, unless you or your institution has a subscription-based Service.

**Use of Content**: You may display, reproduce, print or download content, including images, from the Services only for your personal, non-commercial use. If you are a teacher, scholar or student, you may copy reasonable portions of the content, including images, for lesson plans, interactive whiteboards, reports, dissertations, presentations, school newspapers and for similar nonprofit educational purposes to the extent permitted by applicable law. In each case, however, you may not remove or alter any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary notices or legends. You may not publish, distribute, retransmit, sell or provide access to the content on the Services, except as permitted under applicable law or as described in these Terms of Use. Merriam-Webster works to ensure that all the content on its Services complies with applicable U.S. copyright laws. However, in the case of works on the Services authored by parties other than Merriam-Webster, including User-Generated Content as contemplated by the UGC paragraph below, you may wish to check on their copyright status before downloading them if you are in another country. You may not use data mining, robots, screen scraping, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on the Services, **such as artificial intelligence ("AI") for purposes of developing or training AI or conducting computer analysis**, except with our express written consent. You may not decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the Services, insert any code or product or manipulate the content of the Services in any way that affects the user's experience.

If you want to reproduce or use content for any purpose or in any manner other than as described above, **including for purposes of developing or training AI or to conduct computer analysis**, you will need Merriam-Webster's permission. Requests should be submitted using our [**Contact Form**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/contact-us).

**User-Generated Content**: This section applies to the extent we have enabled posting of user-submitted comments, audio, video, text or other materials in the Services or otherwise allow you to send information or materials through the Services (collectively, UGC).

You are responsible for your own UGC and are responsible for the consequences of sending it through the Services. You must not do the following things: send or post UGC that is copyrighted, unless you are the copyright owner or have the permission of the copyright owner to post it; send or post UGC that reveals trade secrets, unless you own them or have the permission of the owner; send or post UGC that infringes on any other intellectual property rights of others or on the privacy or publicity rights of others or is otherwise unlawful; send or post UGC that is obscene, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful or embarrassing to any other person or entity; send or post a sexually-explicit image; send or post advertisements or solicitations of business; send or post chain letters or the like; or impersonate another person.

By sending or posting UGC, you warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content, and use of your UGC by Merriam-Webster will not infringe or violate the rights of any third-party. By sending UGC, you automatically grant to Merriam-Webster a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display it alone or as part of other works in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, and to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees. You retain the right to reuse your UGC as submitted to Merriam-Webster.

You may not use the Services or other communication mechanisms to sell, to trade, or for other commercial purposes. You may not send UGC through the Services that violates the rights of any third-party or contains a virus or other harmful component. Nor may you use language or engage in any activity that is threatening, abusive, vulgar, discourteous, disruptive, or unlawful.

Please be aware that once you post UGC, there is the potential for the general public to read your words, even years from now. Merriam-Webster suggests that you exercise caution when posting UGC on the Services and that you not disclose personal identifiable information like your location, medical record number, financial information, etc.

The opinions and/or views expressed in UGC represent the thoughts of individuals, and not those necessarily of Merriam-Webster or any of its affiliated companies or any of their respective directors, officers, attorneys, employees, or members of their board of directors. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms of Use, Merriam-Webster should not be seen as endorsing any UGC in any way. Merriam-Webster, its affiliated companies, any of their respective directors, officers, attorneys, employees, and/or members of their board of directors shall not be liable for any UGC posted or sent by users of the Services.

Merriam-Webster does not have any obligation to monitor, edit or delete UGC, but may do so in its sole discretion. UGC including, but not limited to, the following may be deleted or edited by Merriam-Webster:

* Abusive or hurtful UGC about a commentor or another participant;
* Off-topic and redundant UGC (this includes promotion of events, groups, pages, Web sites, organizations and programs not related to or affiliated with Merriam-Webster);
* UGC that uses foul or hateful language;
* Personal attacks or defamatory statements or comments;
* UGC that violate the privacy of our users;
* UGC that is obscene, threatening, harassing, deceptive or fraudulent;
* UGC directed at children under the age of 13;
* UGC that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party or individual; and
* UGC that violates applicable laws or regulations.

By submitting UGC, you understand and acknowledge that this information is available to the public, and that we may use this information for internal and external promotional purposes. Please note that other visitors to the Services may use your posted UGC beyond the control of Merriam-Webster. Except as expressly permitted by these Terms of Use, no other rights or licenses are granted to or implied for the use of UGC by visitors to the Services, **including any right to use UGC for purposes of training a machine learning or AI model**, without the express permission of rightsholders in the applicable UGC. If you do not wish to have the UGC you have made available via the Services used, published, copied and/or reprinted as permitted herein, please do not post UGC on the Services.

**Linking to the Services**: For details on how to link to the Services, [click here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/contact-us).

Any linking to the Services will be at your own risk and expense.

By linking to the Services, you agree that you will not:

* imply in any way, by manner of presentation of the link or otherwise, that Merriam-Webster endorses your site, products or services, or that you are affiliated with Merriam-Webster in any way;
* frame Merriam-Webster content, surround it with your own advertising or identity, or charge a fee for any link to the Services;

**Limitation of Liability**: IN NO EVENT SHALL MERRIAM-WEBSTER, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS, OR CONTENT PROVIDERS BE LIABLE: (i) FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF MERRIAM-WEBSTER WAS PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE IN CONTRACT, TORT, UNDER STATUTE, IN EQUITY, AT LAW, OR OTHERWISE; AND (ii) FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES AND/OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEEDING ONE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US $1,000) IN THE AGGREGATE.

**Indemnification**: To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold Merriam-Webster, its directors, officers, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and licensors harmless from and against all losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of (i) the information or material you submit, including, but not limited to, liability for violations of copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights, or any other intellectual property rights, or the privacy or publicity rights of others, or liability for information or material you provide that is obscene, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful or embarrassing to any other person or entity, or is fraudulent or deceptive, (ii) your use or unauthorized copying of the Services or any of their content, or (iii) your violation of these Terms of Use or any applicable laws or regulations.

**Governing Law & Venue: You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Services and these Terms of Use, including all claims or disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws, including the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. By accessing or using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories, or jurisdictions. Any claim or dispute relating to your access to or use of the Services or asserted under or relating to these Terms of Use shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in New Castle County, Delaware, and we and you each irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in New Castle County, Delaware, for the adjudication of any such claim or dispute.**

**CLASS ACTION WAIVER**: YOU AND MERRIAM-WEBSTER AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, A FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.

Nothing in this paragraph limits your right or Merriam-Webster's right to bring a lawsuit against each other as an individual plaintiff.

**Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year**: To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute arising out of or related to the use of the Services or these Terms of Use must be filed within one year after such claim or dispute arose. The one-year period begins when the notice of such claim or dispute first could be filed. If such a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it shall be permanently barred. Any claim by you that may arise in connection with these Terms of Use will be compensable by monetary damages and you will in no event be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief.

**Survival.** The provisions of these Terms of Use which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms of Use shall survive such termination.

**Waiver.** No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and your or our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**Entire Agreement.** These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between Merriam-Webster and you, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic).

Section 2. Additional Terms of Use for Consumer Subscriptions and Parents and Guardians of Children Under 16 Years Old

If you have questions about whether the Subscription Service is appropriate for your child, please review contact us.
