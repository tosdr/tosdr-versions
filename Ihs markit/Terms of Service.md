    **3\. Additional Product Specific Restrictions on Use**
    
    **3.1 S&P Global Ratings.**
    
    **Historical Ratings pursuant to SEC Rule 17g-7(b)**
    
    Historical S&P Global Ratings credit ratings in each class of credit rating for which S&P Global Ratings is registered as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (**"NRSRO"**) is available at the Regulatory Tab (collectively, the **"Ratings History"**) at [**www.spglobal.com/ratings**](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/). The Ratings History is made available free of charge subject to applicable time delays. It is intended that the availability of Ratings History on this Website will advance the Securities and Exchange Commission (**"SEC"**) goal of fostering accountability and comparability among NRSROs with respect to issuer-paid credit ratings. As such, the Ratings History may be used to, inter alia, perform analysis comparing how different NRSROs perform in the class of credit ratings for which they are registered.
    
    Ratings History may not be used or disseminated in a manner that would serve as a substitute for any S&P Global Ratings product or service for which a fee is charged. This restriction is not intended to prevent the use of the Ratings History in accordance with the SEC’s stated objectives for SEC Rule 17g-7(b).
    
    **Non-Historical Ratings**
    
    All ratings on this Website, excluding only the Ratings History, are referred to as **"Non-Historical Ratings,"** regardless of their currency or date of issuance.
    
    Except as expressly set forth below, you agree not to copy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, or store any Non-Historical Ratings, in whole or in part, from this Website or to display, perform, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast or circulate any Non-Historical Ratings to anyone, or use any Non-Historical Ratings for any commercial purpose, without the express prior written consent of S&P Global Ratings. You may, (a) on an ad hoc basis, use individual Non-Historical Ratings in the ordinary course of securities disclosure activities and the drafting of transaction documents internally within your organization or publish, on a non-commercial basis, selected individual Non-Historical Ratings, and (b) only insofar as you are directly compelled by applicable law or regulation: (1) include credit ratings within a report required by that law or regulation and (2) deliver such report only to such regulator, or authority or government agency as is identified by that law or regulation and solely insofar as to meet your own obligations under that law or regulation and not for the benefit of another party.
    
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Non-Historical Ratings may not (i) be compiled into a database; (ii) be used or disseminated in a manner that would serve as a substitute for any S&P Global product or service for which a fee is charged; or (iii) be systematically distributed or shared.
    
    **Narrative and Other Content**
    
    You may also, on an occasional, ad hoc basis, reproduce, distribute, display or transmit an insubstantial portion of other narrative (non-ratings) content (**"Narrative Content"**), for a non-commercial purpose and without charge, to a limited number of individuals, provided you include all copyright and other proprietary rights notices and the S&P Global Ratings disclaimer with such portion of the Narrative Content in the same form in which the notices and disclaimer appear on the Website, the original source attribution, and the phrase "Used with permission from S&P Global Ratings." However, you may not post Narrative Content from this Website to forums, newsgroups, list serves, mailing lists, electronic bulletin boards, or other sites, without the prior written consent of S&P Global Ratings.

    **3.2 S&P Dow Jones Indices**. Unless otherwise permitted, S&P Dow Jones Indices (**“SPDJI”**) data may be used solely for internal business purposes. You understand and agree that you shall not: (i) use the SPDJI data to create, issue, manage, sponsor or develop any financial products (including, without limitation, derivatives, funds, structured products or contracts for difference) or asset management where the price, return and/or performance of such product is based on or intended to track any index published by SPDJI including, without limitation, customized versions thereof, such as direct indexing; (ii) use the SPDJI data to create or develop indices, a classification system or historical databases; (iii) create any derived data based on the SPDJI data, except with SPDJI’s express written consent; (or) disclose, duplicate, display, redistribute, resell or otherwise convey the SPDJI data or any portion thereof internally within your organization except to other authorized end users of the relevant SPDJI services or externally to any third party.   
    
    SPDJI licenses its indices for use with financial products and receives compensation in connection with such licensing.  SPDJI does not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, to the owners of such financial products or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in such financial products or the ability of SPDJI’s indices to track market performance.  SPDJI is not a fiduciary, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator or a broker dealer.  Inclusion of a security, commodity, cryptocurrency or other asset within an index is not a recommendation by SPDJI to buy, sell, or hold such security, commodity, cryptocurrency or other asset, nor is it considered to be investment advice or commodity trading advice.  The opinions, observations, and analysis of SPDJI included within this Website are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell any securities, other assets or make any investment decisions. SPDJI assumes no obligation to update any Content included within this Website following publication. Users of the Website should not rely on any of the Content in making any investment decision. SPDJI’s opinions, observations and analyses do not address the suitability of any security or other asset.  While SPDJI has obtained information from sources it believes to be reliable, SPDJI does not perform an audit and undertakes no duty of due diligence or independent verification of any information it receives. 
    
    PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE/BACK-TESTED DATA. All SPDJI Index information presented on the Website prior to an index’s Launch Date is hypothetical (back-tested), not actual performance. The back-test calculations are based on the same methodology that was in effect on the index Launch Date. However, when creating back-tested history for periods of market anomalies or other periods that do not reflect the general current market environment, index methodology rules may be relaxed to capture a large enough universe of securities to simulate the target market the index is designed to measure or strategy the index is designed to capture. For example, market capitalization and liquidity thresholds may be reduced. Complete index methodology details are available at [**www.spdji.com**](http://www.spdji.com/). Past performance of the Index is not an indication of future results. Back-tested performance reflects application of an index methodology and selection of index constituents with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of factors that may have positively affected its performance, cannot account for all financial risk that may affect results and may be considered to reflect survivor/look ahead bias. Actual returns may differ significantly from, and be lower than, back-tested returns. Past performance is not an indication or guarantee of future results. Please refer to the methodology for the index for more details about the index, including the manner in which it is rebalanced, the timing of such rebalancing, criteria for additions and deletions, as well as all index calculations. Back-tested performance is for use with institutions only, not for use with retail investors.
    
    SPDJI defines various dates to assist our clients in providing transparency. The First Value Date is the first day for which there is a calculated value (either live or back-tested) for a given index. The Base Date is the date at which the index is set to a fixed value for calculation purposes. The Launch Date designates the date when the values of an index are first considered live: index values provided for any date or time period prior to the index’s Launch Date are considered back-tested. SPDJI defines the Launch Date as the date by which the values of an index are known to have been released to the public, for example via the company’s public Website or its data feed to external parties. For Dow Jones-branded indices introduced prior to May 31, 2013, the **“Launch Date”** (which prior to May 31, 2013, was termed “Date of introduction”) is set at a date upon which no further changes were permitted to be made to the index methodology, but that may have been prior to the Index’s public release date.
    
    Typically, when SPDJI creates back-tested index data, SPDJI uses actual historical constituent-level data (e.g., historical price, market capitalization, and corporate action data) in its calculations. As ESG investing is still in early stages of development, certain datapoints used to calculate S&P DJI’s ESG indices may not be available for the entire desired period of back-tested history. The same data availability issue could be true for other indices as well. In cases when actual data is not available for all relevant historical periods, SPDJI may employ a process of using “Backward Data Assumption” (or pulling back) of ESG data for the calculation of back-tested historical performance. “Backward Data Assumption” is a process that applies the earliest actual live data point available for an index constituent company to all prior historical instances in the index performance. For example, Backward Data Assumption inherently assumes that companies currently not involved in a specific business activity (also known as “product involvement”) were never involved historically and similarly also assumes that companies currently involved in a specific business activity were involved historically too. The Backward Data Assumption allows the hypothetical back-test to be extended over more historical years than would be feasible using only actual data. For more information on “Backward Data Assumption” please refer to the [**FAQ**](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/education/article/faq-esg-back-testing-backward-data-assumption-overview/). The methodology and factsheets of any index that employs backward assumption in the back-tested history will explicitly state so. The methodology will include an Appendix with a table setting forth the specific data points and relevant time period for which backward projected data was used.
    
    Index returns shown do not represent the results of actual trading of investable assets/securities. SPDJI maintains the index and calculates the index levels and performance shown or discussed but does not manage actual assets. Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or investment funds that are intended to track the performance of the index. The imposition of these fees and charges would cause actual and back-tested performance of the securities/fund to be lower than the Index performance shown. As a simple example, if an index returned 10% on a US $100,000 investment for a 12-month period (or US $10,000) and an actual asset-based fee of 1.5% was imposed at the end of the period on the investment plus accrued interest (or US $1,650), the net return would be 8.35% (or US $8,350) for the year. Over a three-year period, an annual 1.5% fee taken at year end with an assumed 10% return per year would result in a cumulative gross return of 33.10%, a total fee of US $5,375, and a cumulative net return of 27.2% (or US $27,200).

None of Bloomberg, ISDA or, where applicable, ICE guarantees or makes any claim, prediction, warranty or representation whatsoever, express or implied, regarding the timeliness, accuracy, completeness of, or fitness for a particular purpose with respect to, the Fallback Rates Data and each shall have no liability in connection with the Fallback Rates Data. Without limiting the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, none of Bloomberg, ISDA or, where applicable, ICE will be liable in contract or tort (including negligence), for breach of statutory duty or nuisance, or under antitrust laws, for misrepresentation or otherwise, in respect of any inaccuracies, errors, omissions, delays, failures, cessations or changes (material or otherwise) in the Fallback Rates Data, or for any damage, expense or other loss (whether direct or indirect) suffered by any person arising out of or in connection with the Fallback Rates Data or any reliance placed upon it by any person, and all implied terms, conditions and warranties, including, without limitation, as to quality, merchantability, fitness for purpose, title or non-infringement, in relation to the Fallback Rates Data, are hereby excluded. None of Bloomberg, ISDA or, where applicable, ICE makes any representations regarding whether the Fallback Rates Data would be appropriate for derivative or non-derivative financial instruments, including derivatives transacted outside of standard ISDA documentation and related protocols. Market participants are encouraged to consider and analyze the details of the Fallback Rates Data and determine independently whether they would be appropriate for any such use. Where Fallback Rates Data is used by IHS Markit as an input into: (i) a transaction, valuation, payment amount or settlement price and/or amount of an Approved Financial Product, or (ii) an index or benchmark, or constituents in any index or benchmark, and such Fallback Rates Data is disclosed by IHS Markit to you, you may only use it to identify how the Fallback Rates Data is used in connection with such use set out at (i) and (ii). “Approved Financial Product” means all financial products (created by any entity) incorporating or based upon ISDA Documentation for which the Fallback Rate(s) act as fallbacks as well as all other derivatives as well as cash security instruments, including, but not limited to, bonds, FRNs, loans and mortgages that have opted to use the Fallback Rate(s) as fallbacks in use cases not covered by ISDA Documentation. “ISDA Documentation” means standard documents produced and maintained by ISDA (such as the Supplement to the 2006 ISDA Definitions and related protocols) or instruments that incorporate such ISDA-maintained documents, including by exchange, clearing or other rule or reference.
    
    Any other usage of any Fallback Rates Data (including pursuant to the usage terms referenced below) is prohibited without a separate agreement with Bloomberg in respect of such usage, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

    Purchase Order Terms and Conditions - German (Deutsche)
    
    **1\. Allgemeines, Geltungsbereich**  
    1.1 Die vorliegenden Allgemeinen Einkaufsbedingungen ("AEB") gelten für alle Geschäftsbeziehungen mit unseren Geschäftspartnern und Lieferanten (nachfolgend: "Lieferanten"). Sie gelten in ihrer jeweiligen Fassung als Rahmenvereinbarung auch für zukünftige Vertrage mit demselben Lieferanten, ohne dass wir in jedem Einzelfall wieder auf sie hinweisen müssten; über Änderungen unserer AEB werden wir den Lieferanten in diesem Fall unverzüglich informieren.  
      
    1.2 Unsere AEB gelten ausschließlich. Entgegenstehende oder von unseren AEB oder von gesetzlichen Bestimmungen abweichende Bedingungen des Lieferanten erkennen wir nicht an, es sei denn wir haben ausdrücklich schriftlich ihrer Geltung zugestimmt. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn wir nicht ausdrücklich widersprochen haben oder in Kenntnis der Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen des Lieferanten dessen Lieferungen vorbehaltlos annehmen.
    
    1.3 Alle Vereinbarungen, die zwischen uns und dem Lieferanten zwecks Ausführung dieses Vertrags getroffen werden, sind in diesem Vertrag schriftlich niedergelegt. Rechtserhebliche Erklärungen und Anzeigen, die nach Vertragsschluss vom Lieferanten uns gegenüber abzugeben sind (z.B. Fristsetzungen, Mahnungen, Erklärung von Rücktritt), bedürfen zu ihrer Wirksamkeit der Schriftform.  
      
    1.4 Im Einzelfall getroffene, individuelle Vereinbarungen (einschließlich Nebenabreden, Ergänzungen, Änderungen) haben in jedem Fall Vorrang vor diesen AEB. Für den Inhalt derartiger Vereinbarungen ist ein schriftlicher Vertrag bzw. unsere schriftliche Bestätigung maßgebend.  
      
    1.5 Hinweise auf die Geltung gesetzlicher Vorschriften haben nur klarstellende Bedeutung. Auch ohne eine derartige Klarstellung gelten daher die gesetzlichen Vorschriften, soweit sie in diesen AEB nicht unmittelbar abgeändert oder ausdrücklich ausgeschlossen werden.  
      
    1.6 Unsere AEB gelten nur gegenüber Unternehmern gemäß § 14 BGB, sowie gegenüber juristischen Personen des öffentlichen Rechts oder gegenüber öffentlich-rechtlichem Sondervermögen.
    
    **2\. Bestellung und Auftragsbestätigung, Vertragsschluss**  
    2.1 Unsere Bestellung gilt frühestens mit schriftlicher Abgabe oder Bestätigung als verbindlich. Auf offensichtliche Irrtümer (z.B. Schreib- und Rechenfehler) und Unvollständigkeiten der Bestellung einschließlich der Bestellunterlagen hat uns der Lieferant zum Zweck der Korrektur bzw. Vervollständigung vor Annahme hinzuweisen; ansonsten gilt der Vertrag als nicht geschlossen.  
      
    **3\. Preise und Zahlungsbedingungen, Rechnungsangaben**  
    3.1 Der in der Bestellung angegebene Preis ist bindend. Alle Preise verstehen sich einschließlich gesetzlicher Umsatzsteuer, wenn diese nicht gesondert ausgewiesen ist.  
      
    3.2 Sofern im Einzelfall nicht etwas Anderes vereinbart ist, schließt der Preis alle Leistungen und Nebenleistungen des Lieferanten (z.B. Montage, Einbau) sowie alle Nebenkosten (z.B. ordnungsgemäße Verpackung, Transportkosten einschließlich eventueller Transport- und Haftpflichtversicherung) ein. Verpackungsmaterial hat der Lieferant auf unser Verlangen zurückzunehmen.  
      
    3.3 In sämtlichen Rechnungen, Auftragsbestätigungen und Lieferpapieren sind unsere Bestellnummer die Artikel-Nr., Liefermenge und Lieferanschrift anzugeben. Sollten eine oder mehrere dieser Angaben fehlen und sich dadurch im Rahmen unseres normalen Geschäftsverkehrs die Bearbeitung durch uns verzögern, verlängern sich die in Ziffer 3.5 genannten Zahlungsfristen um den Zeitraum der Verzögerung. Rechnungszweitschriften sind als Duplikate zu kennzeichnen. Der Lieferant soll die Rechnung innerhalb von zehn Werktagen nach Vertragsschluss an uns übermitteln.  
      
    3.4 Jede Rechnung des Lieferanten muss die Voraussetzungen des § 15 Abs. 4 UStG, wie z.B. die gesonderte Ausweisung der gesetzlichen Mehrwertsteuer, erfüllen. Andernfalls ist der Vorsteuerabzug aus dem Rechnungsbetrag nicht möglich. In diesen Fällen geraten wir nicht in Zahlungsverzug.  
      
    3.5 Sofern im Einzelfall nicht etwas Anderes vereinbart ist, ist der vereinbarte Preis innerhalb von 60 Kalendertagen ab vollständiger Lieferung und Leistung (einschließlich einer etwa vereinbarten Abnahme) sowie Zugang einer ordnungsgemäßen Rechnung zur Zahlung fällig. Soweit der Lieferant Materialtests, Prüfprotokolle, Qualitätsdokumente oder andere Unterlagen zur Verfügung zu stellen hat, setzt die Vollständigkeit der Lieferung auch den Eingang dieser Unterlagen bei uns voraus.
    
    3.6 Wir schulden keine Fälligkeitszinsen (§ 353 HGB). Der Anspruch des Lieferanten auf Zahlung von Verzugszinsen bleibt unberührt. Für den Eintritt unseres Verzugs gelten die gesetzlichen Vorschriften. In jedem Fall ist aber eine Mahnung durch den Lieferanten erforderlich.  
      
    3.7 Aufrechnungs- und Zurückbehaltungsrechte sowie die Einrede des nicht erfüllten Vertrags stehen uns in gesetzlichem Umfang zu. Wir sind insbesondere berechtigt, fällige Zahlungen zurückzuhalten, solange uns noch Ansprüche aus unvollständigen oder mangelhaften Leistungen gegen den Lieferanten zustehen.  
      
    3.8 Der Lieferant hat ein Aufrechnungs- oder Zurückbehaltungsrecht nur wegen rechtskräftig festgestellter oder unbestrittener Gegenforderungen.  
      
    3.9 Zahlungen bedeuten keine Anerkennung der Lieferungen oder Leistungen des Lieferanten als vertragsgemäß.  
      
    **4\. Lieferzeit und Lieferverzug**  
    4.1 Die in der Bestellung angegebene Lieferzeit (Liefertermin oder -frist) ist bindend. Vorzeitige Lieferungen sind nicht zulässig. Wenn die Lieferzeit in der Bestellung nicht angegeben wurde und auch nicht anderweitig vereinbart wurde, beträgt die Lieferzeit vier Wochen ab Vertragsschluss.  
      
    4.2 Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, uns unverzüglich schriftlich zu informieren, wenn Umstände eintreten oder erkennbar werden, wonach die Lieferzeit nicht eingehalten werden kann.  
      
    4.3 Im Falle des Lieferverzugs stehen uns uneingeschränkt die gesetzlichen Ansprüche zu, einschließlich des Rücktrittsrechts und des Anspruchs auf Schadensersatz statt der Leistung nach fruchtlosem Ablauf einer angemessenen Nachfrist. Die Regelungen in Ziffer 4.4 bleiben unberührt.  
      
    4.4 Im Falle des Lieferverzugs sind wir berechtigt, eine Vertragsstrafe in Höhe von 0,5 % des Lieferwerts pro vollendete Kalenderwoche zu verlangen, nicht jedoch mehr als 5 % des Lieferwertes. Wir sind berechtigt, eine Vertragsstrafe neben der Erfüllung geltend zu machen. Nehmen wir die verspätete Leistung an, müssen wir die Vertragsstrafe spätestens mit der Schlusszahlung geltend machen. Weitergehende Ansprüche und Rechte bleiben vorbehalten. Verlangen wir Schadensersatz, steht dem Lieferanten das Recht zu, nachzuweisen, dass uns überhaupt kein Schaden entstanden ist.
    
    **5\. Lieferung, Gefahrübergang, Annahmeverzug**  
    5.1 Der Lieferant ist ohne unsere vorherige schriftliche Zustimmung nicht berechtigt, die von ihm geschuldete Leistung durch Dritte (z.B. Subunternehmer) erbringen zu lassen.  
      
    5.2 Die Lieferung erfolgt, sofern nichts Anderes schriftlich vereinbart ist, "frei Haus" an den in der Bestellung angegebenen Ort. Ist der Bestimmungsort nicht angegeben und nichts Anderes vereinbart, so hat die Lieferung an unseren Geschäftssitz in Frankfurt zu erfolgen. Der jeweilige Bestimmungsort ist auch der Erfüllungsort (Bringschuld). Wird Lieferung "ab Werk" vereinbart, hat der Lieferant zu den jeweils niedrigsten Kosten zu versenden, soweit keine bestimmte Beförderungsart vereinbart ist.  
      
    5.3 Der Lieferung ist ein Lieferschein unter Angabe von Datum (Ausstellung und Versand), Inhalt der Lieferung (Artikelnummer und Anzahl) sowie unserer vollständigen Bestellkennzeichen (Datum und Nummer) beizulegen. Fehlt der Lieferschein oder ist er unvollständig, so sind die dadurch entstehenden Verzögerungen in der Bearbeitung nicht von uns zu vertreten. Getrennt vom Lieferschein ist uns eine entsprechende Versandanzeige mit dem gleichen Inhalt zuzusenden.  
      
    5.4 Die Gefahr des zufälligen Untergangs und der zufälligen Verschlechterung des Liefergegenstands geht mit Übergabe am Erfüllungsort auf uns über. Soweit eine Abnahme vereinbart ist, ist diese für den Gefahrübergang maßgebend. Auch im Übrigen gelten bei einer Abnahme die gesetzlichen Vorschriften des Werkvertragsrechts. Der Übergabe bzw. Abnahme steht es gleich, wenn wir uns im Annahmeverzug befinden.  
      
    5.5 Für den Eintritt unseres Annahmeverzuges gelten die gesetzlichen Vorschriften. Der Lieferant muss uns seine Leistung aber auch dann ausdrücklich anbieten, wenn für eine Handlung oder Mitwirkung unsererseits (z.B. Bereitstellung von Material) eine bestimmte oder bestimmbare Kalenderzeit vereinbart ist. Geraten wir in Annahmeverzug, so kann der Lieferant nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften Ersatz seiner Mehraufwendungen verlangen. Betrifft der Vertrag eine vom Lieferanten herzustellende, unvertretbare Sache (Einzelanfertigung), so stehen dem Lieferanten weitergehende Rechte nur zu, wenn wir uns zur Mitwirkung verpflichtet und das Unterbleiben der Mitwirkung zu vertreten haben.  
      
    5.6 Sofern nichts Anderes schriftlich vereinbart ist, sind Teil-, Mehr- oder Minderlieferungen nicht zulässig.
    
    **6\. Erfüllungsgehilfen**  
    6.1 Zum Einsatz von Subunternehmern oder sonstigen Erfüllungsgehilfen für die Erbringung der vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen ist der Lieferant nur nach unserer vorigeren schriftlichen Zustimmung berechtigt. Dies gilt nicht für freie Mitarbeiter des Lieferanten, die in die Arbeits- und Organisationsstruktur des Lieferanten eingebunden sind.  
      
    6.2 Auch nach unserer Zustimmung im Sinne von Ziffer 6.1 hat der Lieferant sicherzustellen, dass Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen und freie Mitarbeiter die Vorgaben dieser AEB einhalten.  
      
    6.3 Soweit der Lieferant im Rahmen der Zurverfügungstellung aller zur Durchführung eines Projekts erforderlichen personellen und sachlichen Mittel Vereinbarungen mit Dritten abschließt, erfolgt dies im eigenen Namen und auf eigene Rechnung.  
      
    **7\. Eigentumssicherung, Beistellung, Werkzeuge**  
    7.1 An Abbildungen, Plänen, Zeichnungen, Berechnungen, Ausführungsanweisungen, Produktbeschreibungen und sonstigen Unterlagen und Informationen behalten wir uns Eigentums- und Urheberrechte vor. Derartige Unterlagen und Informationen sind ausschließlich für die vertragliche Leistung zu verwenden und nach Erfüllung des Vertrags an uns zurückzugeben. Gegenüber Dritten sind die Unterlagen geheim zu halten, und zwar auch nach Beendigung des Vertrags. Die Geheimhaltungsverpflichtung erlischt erst, wenn und soweit das in den überlassenen Unterlagen enthaltene Wissen allgemein bekannt geworden ist.  
      
    7.2 Ziffer 7.1 gilt entsprechend für Stoffe und Materialien die wir dem Lieferanten zur Herstellung beistellen. Derartige Gegenstände sind – solange sie nicht verarbeitet werden – auf Kosten des Lieferanten gesondert zu verwahren, zu bezeichnen und zu verwalten sowie in üblichem Umfang gegen Zerstörung und Verlust zu versichern. Bei Wertminderung oder Verlust ist vom Lieferanten Ersatz zu leisten.  
      
    7.3 Sofern wir Stoffe und Materialien beim Lieferanten beistellen, wird die Verarbeitung oder Umbildung durch den Lieferanten für uns vorgenommen. Wird unsere Vorbehaltsware mit anderen, uns nicht gehörenden Gegenständen verarbeitet, so erwerben wir das Miteigentum an der neuen Sache im Verhältnis des Wertes unserer Sache zu den anderen verarbeiteten Gegenständen zur Zeit der Verarbeitung.
    
    7.4 Werden von uns beigestellte Stoffe und Materialien mit anderen, uns nicht gehörenden Gegenständen untrennbar vermischt, so erwerben wir das Miteigentum an der neuen Sache im Verhältnis des Wertes der Vorbehaltssache zu den anderen vermischten Gegenständen zum Zeitpunkt der Vermischung. Erfolgt die Vermischung in der Weise, dass die Sache des Lieferanten als Hauptsache anzusehen ist, so gilt als vereinbart, dass der Lieferant uns anteilmäßig Miteigentum überträgt; der Lieferant verwahrt das Alleineigentum oder das Miteigentum unentgeltlich für uns mit der Sorgfalt eines ordentlichen Kaufmanns.  
      
    7.5 Werkzeuge, Formen, Muster, Modelle, Profile, Zeichnungen, Normenblätter, Druckvorlagen und Lehren, die wir dem Lieferanten zur Verfügung stellen oder die zu Vertragszwecken gefertigt und uns durch den Lieferanten gesondert berechnet werden, bleiben unser Eigentum oder gehen in unser Eigentum über. Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, diese Gegenstände ausschließlich für die Herstellung der von uns bestellten Liefergegenstände einzusetzen. Sie sind durch den Lieferanten als unser Eigentum kenntlich zu machen und gegen unbefugte Einsichtnahme oder Verwendung zu sichern. Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, die uns gehörenden Werkzeuge zum Neuwert auf eigene Kosten gegen Feuer-, Wasser- und Diebstahlschaden zu versichern. Gleichzeilig tritt er uns schon jetzt alle Entschädigungsansprüche aus dieser Versicherung ab; wir nehmen die Abtretung hiermit an. Der Lieferant ist ferner verpflichtet, etwa erforderliche Wartungs­ und Inspektionsarbeiten an unseren Werkzeugen sowie alle Instandhaltungs- und Instandsetzungsarbeiten auf eigene Kosten rechtzeitig durchzuführen. Etwaige Störfälle hat er uns sofort anzuzeigen; unterlässt er dies schuldhaft, so bleiben Schadenersatzansprüche unberührt. Der Lieferant ist nach Aufforderung verpflichtet, die Werkzeuge und andere Gegenstände in ordnungsgemäßen Zustand an uns herauszugeben, wenn sie von ihm nicht mehr zur Erfüllung der mit uns geschlossenen Verträge benötigt werden.  
      
    7.6 Die Übereignung der vom Lieferanten gelieferten Liefergegenstände an uns erfolgt unbedingt und ohne Rücksicht auf die Zahlung des Preises. Ausgeschlossen sind jedenfalls alle Formen des erweiterten oder verlängerten Eigentumsvorbehalts, so dass ein vom Lieferanten ggf. wirksam erklärter Eigentumsvorbehalt nur bis zur Bezahlung der an uns gelieferten Ware und für diese gilt.
    
    **8\. Mängeluntersuchung**  
    8.1 Für unsere Rechte bei Sach- und Rechtsmängeln der Liefergegenstände (einschließlich Falsch- und Minderlieferung sowie unsachgemäßer Montage, mangelhafter Montage-, Betriebs- oder Bedienungsanleitung) und bei sonstigen Pflichtverletzungen durch den Lieferanten gelten die gesetzlichen Vorschriften, soweit nachfolgend nichts Anderes bestimmt ist.  
      
    8.2 Nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften haftet der Lieferant insbesondere dafür, dass die Liefergegenstände bei Gefahrübergang auf uns die vereinbarte Beschaffenheit haben. Als Vereinbarung über die Beschaffenheit gelten jedenfalls diejenigen Produktbeschreibungen, die – insbesondere durch Bezeichnung oder Bezugnahme in unserer Bestellung – Gegenstand des jeweiligen Vertrags sind oder in gleicher Weise wie diese AEB in den Vertrag einbezogen wurden. Es macht dabei keinen Unterschied, ob die Produktbeschreibung von uns, vom Lieferanten oder vom Hersteller stammt.  
      
    8.3 Abweichend von § 442 Abs. 1 Satz 2 BGB stehen uns Mängelansprüche uneingeschränkt auch dann zu, wenn uns der Mangel bei Vertragsschluss infolge grober Fahrlässigkeit unbekannt geblieben ist.  
      
    8.4 Für die kaufmännische Untersuchungs- und Rügepflicht gelten, sofern nichts anderes schriftlich vereinbart ist (z.B. Qualitätssicherungsvereinbarung), die gesetzlichen Vorschriften (§§ 377, 381 HGB) mit folgender Maßgabe: Unsere Untersuchungspflicht beschränkt sich auf Mängel, die bei unserer Wareneingangskontrolle unter äußerlicher Begutachtung einschließlich der Lieferpapiere sowie bei unserer Qualitätskontrolle im Stichprobenverfahren offen zu Tage treten (z.B. Transportbeschädigungen, Falsch- und Minderlieferung). Soweit eine Abnahme vereinbart ist, besteht keine Untersuchungspflicht. Im Übrigen kommt es darauf an, inwieweit eine Untersuchung unter Berücksichtigung der Umstände des Einzelfalls nach ordnungsgemäßem Geschäftsgang tunlich ist. Unsere Rügepflicht für später entdeckte Mängel bleibt unberührt. In allen Fällen gilt unsere Rüge (Mängelanzeige) als unverzüglich und rechtzeitig, wenn sie innerhalb von fünf Arbeitstagen, gerechnet ab Wareneingang oder bei versteckten Mängeln ab Entdeckung, beim Lieferanten eingeht.  
      
    8.5 Die zum Zweck der Prüfung und Nachbesserung vom Lieferanten aufgewendeten Kosten trägt dieser auch dann, wenn sich herausstellt, dass tatsächlich kein Mangel vorlag. Unsere Schadensersatzhaftung bei unberechtigtem Mängelbeseitigungsverlangen bleibt unberührt; insoweit haften wir jedoch nur, wenn wir erkannt oder grob fahrlässig nicht erkannt haben, dass kein Mangel vorlag.
    
    8.6 Kommt der Lieferant seiner Verpflichtung zur Nichterfüllung – nach unserer Wahl durch Beseitigung des Mangels (Nachbesserung) oder durch Lieferung einer mangelfreien Sache (Ersatzlieferung) – innerhalb einer von uns gesetzten, angemessenen Frist nicht nach, so können wir den Mangel selbst beseitigen und vom Lieferanten Ersatz der hierfür erforderlichen Aufwendungen bzw. einen entsprechenden Vorschuss verlangen. Ist die Nichterfüllung durch den Lieferanten fehlgeschlagen oder für uns unzumutbar (z.B. wegen besonderer Dringlichkeit Gefährdung der Betriebssicherheit oder drohendem Eintritt unverhältnismäßiger Schaden) bedarf es keiner Fristsetzung; der Lieferant ist unverzüglich, nach Möglichkeit vorher, zu unterrichten.  
      
    8.7 Im Übrigen sind wir bei einem Sach- oder Rechtsmangel nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften zur Minderung des Kaufpreises oder zum Rücktritt vom Vertrag berechtigt. Außerdem haben wir nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften Anspruch auf Schadens- und Aufwendungsersatz.  
      
    8.8 Durch Abnahme oder durch Billigung von vorgelegten Mustern oder Proben verzichten wir nicht auf Gewährleistungsansprüche.
    
    **9\. Compliance-Grundsätze für die Zusammenarbeit**  
    9.1 Der Lieferant, seine Mitarbeiter und von ihm möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen werden die vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen im Einklang mit den anwendbaren nationalen und internationalen Rechtsvorschriften erbringen. Das gilt insbesondere, jedoch nicht ausschließlich, für die anwendbaren Rechtsvorschriften der folgenden Länder: • Deutschland; • USA; • Irland; und • UK.  
      
    9.2 Ferner gilt dies insbesondere, jedoch nicht ausschließlich, für die anwendbaren Rechtsvorschriften in den folgenden Rechtsgebieten: • Antikorruptionsrecht; • Kartell- und Wettbewerbsrecht; • Außenwirtschaftsrecht; • Umweltrecht; • Datenschutzrecht.  
      
    9.3 Der Lieferant sichert zu, dass seine Mitarbeiter und von ihr möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen mit den Geboten und Verboten der Rechtsvorschriften vertraut sind, die auf die vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen anwendbar sind.  
      
    9.4 Der Lieferant, seine Mitarbeiter und von ihm möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen werden die vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen insbesondere im Einklang mit den anwendbaren Rechtsvorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Korruption erbringen. Sie werden weder selbst noch über Dritte Geld, Geschenke, Einladungen oder andere unzulässige Vorteile Personen gewahren oder versprechen, die Entscheidungen im Hinblick auf uns treffen. Sie können solchen Personen nur dann Geschenke, Bewirtungen oder sonstige Vorteile anbieten oder gewahren, wenn wir vorher schriftlich zugstimmt hat.  
      
    9.5 Der Lieferant verpflichtet sich, nach jedem vollen Jahr der Vertragslaufzeit innerhalb von vierzehn Tagen eine schriftliche Bestätigung an uns zu schicken, dass er, seine Mitarbeiter sowie von ihm möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen bei allen vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen die Bestimmungen der Ziffern 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 und 6.1 – Subunternehmer befolgt haben. Solange der Lieferant die Bestätigung nicht geschickt hat, haben wir das Recht, alle ausstehenden Zahlungen zurückzuhalten.  
      
    9.6 Wenn der Lieferant, seine Mitarbeiter und von ihm möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmen oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen gegen Bestimmungen der Ziffern 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 und 6.1 - Subunternehmer verstoßen, sind wir berechtigt die vertragliche Beziehung mit dem Lieferanten außerordentlich fristlos zu kündigen.
    
    9.7 Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, uns den Schaden, insbesondere einschließlich Mehrsteuern, hoheitlicher Sanktionen, Rechtsverteidigungskosten etc.) zu ersetzen.  
      
    **10\. Produkthaftung, Freistellung, Haftpflichtversicherung**  
    10.1 Der Lieferant haftet dafür, dass die gelieferte Ware den vereinbarten Produktspezifikationen sowie den aktuellen gesetzlichen Bestimmungen des jeweiligen Landes, in Ermangelung solcher zumindest den handelsüblichen Qualitätsbestimmungen, entspricht und darüber hinaus frei von Mängeln oder Fehlern im Sinne des Produkthaftungsgesetzes ist.  
      
    10.2 Soweit der Lieferant für einen Produktschaden verantwortlich ist, ist er verpflichtet, uns insoweit von Schadenersatzansprüchen Dritter auf erstes Anfordern freizustellen, als die Ursache in seinem Herrschafts- und Organisationsbereich gesetzt ist und er im Außenverhältnis selbst haftet.  
      
    10.3 Bei Rohstoffen und Primär-Packstoffen garantiert der Lieferant die jederzeitige lückenlose Rückverfolgbarkeit der jeweiligen Produkte.  
      
    10.4 Im Rahmen seiner Haftung für Schadensfälle im Sinn von Ziffer 10.1 ist der Lieferant auch verpflichtet, etwaige Aufwendungen gemäß §§ 683, 670 BGB oder gemäß §§ 830, 840, 426 BGB zu erstatten, die sich aus oder im Zusammenhang mit einer von uns durchgeführten Rückrufaktion ergeben. Über Inhalt und Umfang der durchzuführenden Rückrufmaßnahmen werden wir den Lieferanten – soweit möglich und zumutbar – unterrichten und ihm Gelegenheit zur Stellungnahme geben. Unberührt bleiben sonstige gesetzliche Ansprüche.  
      
    10.5 Der Lieferant verpflichtet sich, eine Produkthaftpflicht-Versicherung mit einer Deckungssumme von mindestens EUR 1.000.000 pro Personenschaden / Sachschaden – pauschal – zu unterhalten; stehen uns weitergehende Schadenersatzansprüche zu, so bleiben diese unberührt.  
      
    10.6 Wir sind berechtigt, im Rahmen durchzuführender Bewertungen des vereinbarten Qualitätsstandards während der üblichen Betriebs- und Geschäftsstunden nach vorheriger Anmeldung das Werk des Lieferanten zu betreten.
    
    **11\. Schutzrechte Dritter**  
    11.1 Der Lieferant gewährleistet, dass im Zusammenhang mit seiner Lieferung keine Schutzrechte Dritter in Ländern der Europäischen Union, Nordamerika oder anderen Ländern, in denen er die Produkte herstellt oder herstellen lässt, verletzt werden.  
      
    11.2 Werden wir von einem Dritten wegen der in Ziffer 11.1 genannten Verletzung von Schutzrechten in Anspruch genommen, so ist der Lieferant verpflichtet, uns von diesen Ansprüchen freizustellen sofern diese Ansprüche nicht offensichtlich unbegründet sind.  
      
    11.3 Wir sind nicht berechtigt, mit dem Dritten – ohne Zustimmung des Lieferanten – irgendwelche Vereinbarungen zu treffen, insbesondere einen Vergleich abzuschließen.  
      
    11.4 Die Freistellungspflicht des Lieferanten bezieht sich auf alle Aufwendungen, die uns aus oder im Zusammenhang mit der Inanspruchnahme durch einen Dritten notwendigerweise erwachsen.  
      
    **12\. Nutzungsrechte an Software**  
    12.1 Der Lieferant gewährt uns das nichtausschließliche, übertragbare, weltweite, inhaltlich und zeitlich unbegrenzte Recht,  
    12.1.1 Software und die dazugehörige Dokumentation (zusammen im folgenden "Software" genannt) zu nutzen oder nutzen zu lassen;  
    12.1.2 das Nutzungsrecht gemäß Ziffer 12.1.1 an mit uns verbundene Unternehmen i.S.v. § 15 AktG, an Distributoren und an Endkunden zu unterlizenzieren;  
    12.1.3 mit uns verbundenen Unternehmen i.S.v. § 15 AktG und anderen Distributoren das Recht einzuräumen, Endkunden das Nutzungsrecht gemäß Ziffer 12.1.1 zu lizensieren;  
    12.1.4 die Software zu kopieren oder durch mit uns verbundene Unternehmen i.S.v. § 15 AktG oder andere Distributoren kopieren zu lassen, soweit dies für die Nutzung, Übertragung, Unterlizensierung oder als Sicherungskopie erforderlich ist.  
      
    12.2 Wir, unsere verbundenen Unternehmen i.S.v. § 15 AktG und andere Distributoren sind zusätzlich zu den nach Ziffer 12.1 eingeräumten Rechten befugt, Endkunden die Übertragung der Softwarelizenzen zu gestatten.  
      
    12.3 Alle von uns gewährten Unterlizenzen müssen angemessenen Schutz für das geistige Eigentum des Lieferanten an der Software vorsehen, indem gegenüber den Unterlizenznehmern / Übertragungsempfängern dieselben vertraglichen Bestimmungen verwendet werden, die der Lieferant zum Schutz des eigenen geistigen Eigentums verwendet.
    
    **13\. Abtretung, Insolvenz des Lieferanten**  
    13.1 Der Lieferant ist nicht berechtigt, seine Forderungen aus dem Vertragsverhältnis mit uns an Dritte abzutreten. Dies gilt nicht, soweit es sich um Geldforderungen handelt.  
    13.2 Wir können vom Vertrag zurücktreten, wenn der Lieferant seine Zahlungen einstellt oder das Insolvenzverfahren oder ein vergleichbares gesetzliches Verfahren beantragt oder ein solches Verfahren eröffnet wird oder dessen Eröffnung mangels Masse abgelehnt wird.  
      
    **14\. Kündigung, Change of Control**  
    14.1 Wir sind berechtigt, die vertragliche Beziehung zum Lieferanten jederzeit durch schriftliche Erklärung unter Angabe des Grundes zu kündigen, wenn wir die bestellten Produkte in unserem Geschäftsbetrieb aufgrund bei Vertragsschluss nicht erkennbaren Umständen nicht mehr verwenden können. Dem Lieferanten werden wir in diesem Fall die von ihm erbrachte Teilleistung vergüten.  
      
    14.2 Im Falle eines Kontrollwechsels im Sinne von Ziffer 14.3 haben wir ein einmaliges Sonderkündigungsrecht, die vertragliche Beziehung mit dem Lieferanten mit einer Kündigungsfrist von vier Wochen zum Monatsende zu kündigen. Das Sonderkündigungsrecht besteht innerhalb von drei Monaten, nachdem dem uns der Kontrollwechsel bekannt geworden ist. Dem Lieferanten werden wir in diesem Fall die von ihm erbrachte Teilleistung vergüten.  
      
    14.3 Ein Kontrollwechsel liegt vor, wenn ein Dritter oder mehrere gemeinsam handelnde Dritte mehr als 50 % der Geschäftsanteile des Lieferanten erwerben.  
      
    **15\. Vertraulichkeit**  
    15.1 Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, den Inhalt unserer Geschäftsbeziehung vertraulich zu behandeln und Dritten nicht zu offenbaren oder sonst unmittelbar oder mittelbar zuganglich zu machen.  
      
    15.2 Der Lieferant wird Geschäfts- und Betriebsgeheimnisse, die ihm im Zusammenhang mit unserer vertraglichen Beziehung anvertraut oder bekannt geworden sind ("Geheime Informationen"), geheim halten und vertraulich behandeln, nicht weitergeben, ausschließlich zur Durchführung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung verwenden und auch nach Beendigung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung weder für sich noch für andere verwerten.
    
    15.3 Der Lieferant darf Geheime Informationen an seine Mitarbeiter oder an Dritte, soweit diese in die Durchführung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung eingebunden sind und die Geheimen Informationen kennen müssen, weitergeben. Soweit eine Weitergabe Geheimer Informationen hiernach zulässig ist, verpflichtet der Lieferant, die Informationsweitergabe an solche Mitarbeiter oder Dritte auf den für die Durchführung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung erforderlichen Umfang zu begrenzen. Der Lieferant verpflichtet sich, solche Mitarbeiter oder Dritte über die aufgrund unserer Geschäftsbeziehung bestehende Geheimhaltungsverpflichtung vor Bekanntgabe einer Geheimen Information zu informieren und entsprechend zur Geheimhaltung zu verpflichten, bevor die Mitarbeiter oder Dritte Zugang zu Geheimen Informationen erhalten. Der Lieferant steht für die Einhaltung der Verpflichtungen gemäß diesen AEB durch die vorgenannten Personen ein.  
      
    15.4 Die Verpflichtung zur Geheimhaltung und Nicht-Weitergabe findet nur Anwendung auf Informationen, die • nicht bereits allgemein bekannt sind oder • der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Lieferanten nicht bereits vorher von uns oder auf nicht vertraulicher Basis gewahrt worden waren oder • der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Partei nicht von Dritten auf nicht vertraulicher Basis zugänglich gemacht wurden, es sei denn, dass der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Partei bekannt war, dass dieser Dritte seinerseits durch die Weitergabe eine Geheimhaltungsvereinbarung mit der anderen Partei verletzt hat.  
      
    15.5 Eine Geheimhaltungspflicht besteht nicht, soweit die die Geheimen Informationen empfangende Partei gesetzlich verpflichtet ist, geheime Informationen in gerichtlichen, behördlichen oder sonstigen Verfahren zu offenbaren.  
      
    15.6 Der Lieferant verpflichtet sich, auf schriftliche Anforderung von uns, jedenfalls aber spätestens mit Beendigung der vertraglichen Beziehung, sämtliche ihr im Zusammenhang der vertraglichen Beziehung überlassenen Unterlagen, Dateien und Datenträger (gleich welcher Art) sowie sämtliche Kopien oder Teile hiervon, die sich noch in seinem Besitz befinden und Geheime Informationen beinhalten oder sich auf solche beziehen, an uns zurückzugeben oder zu zerstören und die Zerstörung schriftlich zu bestätigen soweit nicht aus Gründen zwingenden Rechts oder zur Wahrung berechtigter Interessen der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Lieferanten ohne Gefährdung der Vertraulichkeit ein Verbleib solcher Unterlagen oder Kopien hiervon bei ihr erforderlich ist.  
      
    15.7 Ohne unsere vorherige schriftliche Zustimmung darf der Lieferant in Werbematerial, Broschüren, etc. nicht auf die Geschäftsverbindung mit uns hinweisen und für uns gefertigte Liefergegenstände nicht ausstellen.
    
    **16\. Verjährung**  
    16.1 Die wechselseitigen Ansprüche der Vertragsparteien verjähren nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften, soweit nachfolgend nichts Anderes bestimmt ist.  
      
    16.2 Abweichend von § 438 Abs. 1 Nr. 3 BGB beträgt die allgemeine Verjährungsfrist für Mängelansprüche drei Jahre ab Gefahrübergang. Soweit eine Abnahme vereinbart ist, beginnt die Verjährung mit der Abnahme. Die 3-jährige Verjährungsfrist gilt entsprechend auch für Ansprüche aus Rechtsmängeln, wobei die gesetzliche Verjährungsfrist für dingliche Herausgabeansprüche Dritter (§ 438 Abs. 1 Nr. 1 BGB) unberührt bleibt; Ansprüche aus Rechtsmängeln verjähren darüber hinaus in keinem Fall, solange der Dritte das Recht – insbesondere mangels Verjährung – noch gegen uns geltend machen kann.  
      
    16.3 Die Verjährungsfristen des Kaufrechts einschließlich vorstehender Verlängerung gelten – im gesetzlichen Umfang – für alle vertraglichen Mängelansprüche. Soweit uns wegen eines Mangels auch außervertragliche Schadenersatzansprüche zustehen, gilt hierfür die regelmäßige gesetzliche Verjährung (§§ 195, 199 BGB), wenn nicht die Anwendung der Verjährungsfristen des Kaufrechts im Einzelfall zu einer längeren Verjährungsfrist führt.  
      
    16.4 Bei Ersatzlieferung und Mängelbeseitigung beginnt die Gewährleistungsfrist für ersetzte und nachgebesserte Teile erneut, es sei denn, wir mussten nach dem Verhalten des Lieferanten davon ausgehen, dass dieser sich nicht zu der Maßnahme verpflichtet sah, sondern die Ersatzlieferung oder Mängelbeseitigung nur aus Kulanzgründen oder ähnlichen Gründen vornahm.  
      
    **17\. Schlussbestimmungen**  
    17.1 Soweit der Vertrag oder diese AEB Regelungslücken enthalten, gelten zur Ausfüllung dieser Lücken diejenigen rechtlich wirksamen Regelungen als vereinbart, welche die Vertragspartner nach den wirtschaftlichen Zielsetzungen des Vertrags und dem Zweck dieser AEB vereinbart hatten, wenn sie die Regelungslücke gekannt hatten.  
      
    17.2 Ausschließlicher Gerichtsstand für alle Rechtsstreitigkeiten aus der Geschäftsbeziehung zwischen uns und dem Lieferanten ist Frankfurt am Main; wir sind jedoch auch berechtigt, Klage am allgemeinen Gerichtsstand des Lieferanten zu erheben.  
      
    17.3 Für alle Rechtsbeziehungen zwischen uns und dem Lieferanten gilt ausschließlich das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland unter Ausschluss des Übereinkommens der Vereinten Nationen über Verträge über den internationalen Wareneinkauf (UN­Kaufrecht/CISG) vom 1. April 1980.

Ratings History may not be used or disseminated in a manner that would serve as a substitute for any S&P Global Ratings product or service for which a fee is charged. This restriction is not intended to prevent the use of the Ratings History in accordance with the SEC’s stated objectives for SEC Rule 17g-7(b).

**Non-Historical Ratings**

PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE/BACK-TESTED DATA. All SPDJI Index information presented on the Website prior to an index’s Launch Date is hypothetical (back-tested), not actual performance. The back-test calculations are based on the same methodology that was in effect on the index Launch Date. However, when creating back-tested history for periods of market anomalies or other periods that do not reflect the general current market environment, index methodology rules may be relaxed to capture a large enough universe of securities to simulate the target market the index is designed to measure or strategy the index is designed to capture. For example, market capitalization and liquidity thresholds may be reduced. Complete index methodology details are available at [**www.spdji.com**](http://www.spdji.com/). Past performance of the Index is not an indication of future results. Back-tested performance reflects application of an index methodology and selection of index constituents with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of factors that may have positively affected its performance, cannot account for all financial risk that may affect results and may be considered to reflect survivor/look ahead bias. Actual returns may differ significantly from, and be lower than, back-tested returns. Past performance is not an indication or guarantee of future results. Please refer to the methodology for the index for more details about the index, including the manner in which it is rebalanced, the timing of such rebalancing, criteria for additions and deletions, as well as all index calculations. Back-tested performance is for use with institutions only, not for use with retail investors.

SPDJI defines various dates to assist our clients in providing transparency. The First Value Date is the first day for which there is a calculated value (either live or back-tested) for a given index. The Base Date is the date at which the index is set to a fixed value for calculation purposes. The Launch Date designates the date when the values of an index are first considered live: index values provided for any date or time period prior to the index’s Launch Date are considered back-tested. SPDJI defines the Launch Date as the date by which the values of an index are known to have been released to the public, for example via the company’s public Website or its data feed to external parties. For Dow Jones-branded indices introduced prior to May 31, 2013, the **“Launch Date”** (which prior to May 31, 2013, was termed “Date of introduction”) is set at a date upon which no further changes were permitted to be made to the index methodology, but that may have been prior to the Index’s public release date.

Typically, when SPDJI creates back-tested index data, SPDJI uses actual historical constituent-level data (e.g., historical price, market capitalization, and corporate action data) in its calculations. As ESG investing is still in early stages of development, certain datapoints used to calculate S&P DJI’s ESG indices may not be available for the entire desired period of back-tested history. The same data availability issue could be true for other indices as well. In cases when actual data is not available for all relevant historical periods, SPDJI may employ a process of using “Backward Data Assumption” (or pulling back) of ESG data for the calculation of back-tested historical performance. “Backward Data Assumption” is a process that applies the earliest actual live data point available for an index constituent company to all prior historical instances in the index performance. For example, Backward Data Assumption inherently assumes that companies currently not involved in a specific business activity (also known as “product involvement”) were never involved historically and similarly also assumes that companies currently involved in a specific business activity were involved historically too. The Backward Data Assumption allows the hypothetical back-test to be extended over more historical years than would be feasible using only actual data. For more information on “Backward Data Assumption” please refer to the [**FAQ**](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/education/article/faq-esg-back-testing-backward-data-assumption-overview/). The methodology and factsheets of any index that employs backward assumption in the back-tested history will explicitly state so. The methodology will include an Appendix with a table setting forth the specific data points and relevant time period for which backward projected data was used.

Index returns shown do not represent the results of actual trading of investable assets/securities. SPDJI maintains the index and calculates the index levels and performance shown or discussed but does not manage actual assets. Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or investment funds that are intended to track the performance of the index. The imposition of these fees and charges would cause actual and back-tested performance of the securities/fund to be lower than the Index performance shown. As a simple example, if an index returned 10% on a US $100,000 investment for a 12-month period (or US $10,000) and an actual asset-based fee of 1.5% was imposed at the end of the period on the investment plus accrued interest (or US $1,650), the net return would be 8.35% (or US $8,350) for the year. Over a three-year period, an annual 1.5% fee taken at year end with an assumed 10% return per year would result in a cumulative gross return of 33.10%, a total fee of US $5,375, and a cumulative net return of 27.2% (or US $27,200).

Purchase Order Terms and Conditions - German (Deutsche)

**1\. Allgemeines, Geltungsbereich**  
1.1 Die vorliegenden Allgemeinen Einkaufsbedingungen ("AEB") gelten für alle Geschäftsbeziehungen mit unseren Geschäftspartnern und Lieferanten (nachfolgend: "Lieferanten"). Sie gelten in ihrer jeweiligen Fassung als Rahmenvereinbarung auch für zukünftige Vertrage mit demselben Lieferanten, ohne dass wir in jedem Einzelfall wieder auf sie hinweisen müssten; über Änderungen unserer AEB werden wir den Lieferanten in diesem Fall unverzüglich informieren.  
  
1.2 Unsere AEB gelten ausschließlich. Entgegenstehende oder von unseren AEB oder von gesetzlichen Bestimmungen abweichende Bedingungen des Lieferanten erkennen wir nicht an, es sei denn wir haben ausdrücklich schriftlich ihrer Geltung zugestimmt. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn wir nicht ausdrücklich widersprochen haben oder in Kenntnis der Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen des Lieferanten dessen Lieferungen vorbehaltlos annehmen.

1.3 Alle Vereinbarungen, die zwischen uns und dem Lieferanten zwecks Ausführung dieses Vertrags getroffen werden, sind in diesem Vertrag schriftlich niedergelegt. Rechtserhebliche Erklärungen und Anzeigen, die nach Vertragsschluss vom Lieferanten uns gegenüber abzugeben sind (z.B. Fristsetzungen, Mahnungen, Erklärung von Rücktritt), bedürfen zu ihrer Wirksamkeit der Schriftform.  
  
1.4 Im Einzelfall getroffene, individuelle Vereinbarungen (einschließlich Nebenabreden, Ergänzungen, Änderungen) haben in jedem Fall Vorrang vor diesen AEB. Für den Inhalt derartiger Vereinbarungen ist ein schriftlicher Vertrag bzw. unsere schriftliche Bestätigung maßgebend.  
  
1.5 Hinweise auf die Geltung gesetzlicher Vorschriften haben nur klarstellende Bedeutung. Auch ohne eine derartige Klarstellung gelten daher die gesetzlichen Vorschriften, soweit sie in diesen AEB nicht unmittelbar abgeändert oder ausdrücklich ausgeschlossen werden.  
  
1.6 Unsere AEB gelten nur gegenüber Unternehmern gemäß § 14 BGB, sowie gegenüber juristischen Personen des öffentlichen Rechts oder gegenüber öffentlich-rechtlichem Sondervermögen.

**2\. Bestellung und Auftragsbestätigung, Vertragsschluss**  
2.1 Unsere Bestellung gilt frühestens mit schriftlicher Abgabe oder Bestätigung als verbindlich. Auf offensichtliche Irrtümer (z.B. Schreib- und Rechenfehler) und Unvollständigkeiten der Bestellung einschließlich der Bestellunterlagen hat uns der Lieferant zum Zweck der Korrektur bzw. Vervollständigung vor Annahme hinzuweisen; ansonsten gilt der Vertrag als nicht geschlossen.  
  
**3\. Preise und Zahlungsbedingungen, Rechnungsangaben**  
3.1 Der in der Bestellung angegebene Preis ist bindend. Alle Preise verstehen sich einschließlich gesetzlicher Umsatzsteuer, wenn diese nicht gesondert ausgewiesen ist.  
  
3.2 Sofern im Einzelfall nicht etwas Anderes vereinbart ist, schließt der Preis alle Leistungen und Nebenleistungen des Lieferanten (z.B. Montage, Einbau) sowie alle Nebenkosten (z.B. ordnungsgemäße Verpackung, Transportkosten einschließlich eventueller Transport- und Haftpflichtversicherung) ein. Verpackungsmaterial hat der Lieferant auf unser Verlangen zurückzunehmen.  
  
3.3 In sämtlichen Rechnungen, Auftragsbestätigungen und Lieferpapieren sind unsere Bestellnummer die Artikel-Nr., Liefermenge und Lieferanschrift anzugeben. Sollten eine oder mehrere dieser Angaben fehlen und sich dadurch im Rahmen unseres normalen Geschäftsverkehrs die Bearbeitung durch uns verzögern, verlängern sich die in Ziffer 3.5 genannten Zahlungsfristen um den Zeitraum der Verzögerung. Rechnungszweitschriften sind als Duplikate zu kennzeichnen. Der Lieferant soll die Rechnung innerhalb von zehn Werktagen nach Vertragsschluss an uns übermitteln.  
  
3.4 Jede Rechnung des Lieferanten muss die Voraussetzungen des § 15 Abs. 4 UStG, wie z.B. die gesonderte Ausweisung der gesetzlichen Mehrwertsteuer, erfüllen. Andernfalls ist der Vorsteuerabzug aus dem Rechnungsbetrag nicht möglich. In diesen Fällen geraten wir nicht in Zahlungsverzug.  
  
3.5 Sofern im Einzelfall nicht etwas Anderes vereinbart ist, ist der vereinbarte Preis innerhalb von 60 Kalendertagen ab vollständiger Lieferung und Leistung (einschließlich einer etwa vereinbarten Abnahme) sowie Zugang einer ordnungsgemäßen Rechnung zur Zahlung fällig. Soweit der Lieferant Materialtests, Prüfprotokolle, Qualitätsdokumente oder andere Unterlagen zur Verfügung zu stellen hat, setzt die Vollständigkeit der Lieferung auch den Eingang dieser Unterlagen bei uns voraus.

3.6 Wir schulden keine Fälligkeitszinsen (§ 353 HGB). Der Anspruch des Lieferanten auf Zahlung von Verzugszinsen bleibt unberührt. Für den Eintritt unseres Verzugs gelten die gesetzlichen Vorschriften. In jedem Fall ist aber eine Mahnung durch den Lieferanten erforderlich.  
  
3.7 Aufrechnungs- und Zurückbehaltungsrechte sowie die Einrede des nicht erfüllten Vertrags stehen uns in gesetzlichem Umfang zu. Wir sind insbesondere berechtigt, fällige Zahlungen zurückzuhalten, solange uns noch Ansprüche aus unvollständigen oder mangelhaften Leistungen gegen den Lieferanten zustehen.  
  
3.8 Der Lieferant hat ein Aufrechnungs- oder Zurückbehaltungsrecht nur wegen rechtskräftig festgestellter oder unbestrittener Gegenforderungen.  
  
3.9 Zahlungen bedeuten keine Anerkennung der Lieferungen oder Leistungen des Lieferanten als vertragsgemäß.  
  
**4\. Lieferzeit und Lieferverzug**  
4.1 Die in der Bestellung angegebene Lieferzeit (Liefertermin oder -frist) ist bindend. Vorzeitige Lieferungen sind nicht zulässig. Wenn die Lieferzeit in der Bestellung nicht angegeben wurde und auch nicht anderweitig vereinbart wurde, beträgt die Lieferzeit vier Wochen ab Vertragsschluss.  
  
4.2 Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, uns unverzüglich schriftlich zu informieren, wenn Umstände eintreten oder erkennbar werden, wonach die Lieferzeit nicht eingehalten werden kann.  
  
4.3 Im Falle des Lieferverzugs stehen uns uneingeschränkt die gesetzlichen Ansprüche zu, einschließlich des Rücktrittsrechts und des Anspruchs auf Schadensersatz statt der Leistung nach fruchtlosem Ablauf einer angemessenen Nachfrist. Die Regelungen in Ziffer 4.4 bleiben unberührt.  
  
4.4 Im Falle des Lieferverzugs sind wir berechtigt, eine Vertragsstrafe in Höhe von 0,5 % des Lieferwerts pro vollendete Kalenderwoche zu verlangen, nicht jedoch mehr als 5 % des Lieferwertes. Wir sind berechtigt, eine Vertragsstrafe neben der Erfüllung geltend zu machen. Nehmen wir die verspätete Leistung an, müssen wir die Vertragsstrafe spätestens mit der Schlusszahlung geltend machen. Weitergehende Ansprüche und Rechte bleiben vorbehalten. Verlangen wir Schadensersatz, steht dem Lieferanten das Recht zu, nachzuweisen, dass uns überhaupt kein Schaden entstanden ist.

**5\. Lieferung, Gefahrübergang, Annahmeverzug**  
5.1 Der Lieferant ist ohne unsere vorherige schriftliche Zustimmung nicht berechtigt, die von ihm geschuldete Leistung durch Dritte (z.B. Subunternehmer) erbringen zu lassen.  
  
5.2 Die Lieferung erfolgt, sofern nichts Anderes schriftlich vereinbart ist, "frei Haus" an den in der Bestellung angegebenen Ort. Ist der Bestimmungsort nicht angegeben und nichts Anderes vereinbart, so hat die Lieferung an unseren Geschäftssitz in Frankfurt zu erfolgen. Der jeweilige Bestimmungsort ist auch der Erfüllungsort (Bringschuld). Wird Lieferung "ab Werk" vereinbart, hat der Lieferant zu den jeweils niedrigsten Kosten zu versenden, soweit keine bestimmte Beförderungsart vereinbart ist.  
  
5.3 Der Lieferung ist ein Lieferschein unter Angabe von Datum (Ausstellung und Versand), Inhalt der Lieferung (Artikelnummer und Anzahl) sowie unserer vollständigen Bestellkennzeichen (Datum und Nummer) beizulegen. Fehlt der Lieferschein oder ist er unvollständig, so sind die dadurch entstehenden Verzögerungen in der Bearbeitung nicht von uns zu vertreten. Getrennt vom Lieferschein ist uns eine entsprechende Versandanzeige mit dem gleichen Inhalt zuzusenden.  
  
5.4 Die Gefahr des zufälligen Untergangs und der zufälligen Verschlechterung des Liefergegenstands geht mit Übergabe am Erfüllungsort auf uns über. Soweit eine Abnahme vereinbart ist, ist diese für den Gefahrübergang maßgebend. Auch im Übrigen gelten bei einer Abnahme die gesetzlichen Vorschriften des Werkvertragsrechts. Der Übergabe bzw. Abnahme steht es gleich, wenn wir uns im Annahmeverzug befinden.  
  
5.5 Für den Eintritt unseres Annahmeverzuges gelten die gesetzlichen Vorschriften. Der Lieferant muss uns seine Leistung aber auch dann ausdrücklich anbieten, wenn für eine Handlung oder Mitwirkung unsererseits (z.B. Bereitstellung von Material) eine bestimmte oder bestimmbare Kalenderzeit vereinbart ist. Geraten wir in Annahmeverzug, so kann der Lieferant nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften Ersatz seiner Mehraufwendungen verlangen. Betrifft der Vertrag eine vom Lieferanten herzustellende, unvertretbare Sache (Einzelanfertigung), so stehen dem Lieferanten weitergehende Rechte nur zu, wenn wir uns zur Mitwirkung verpflichtet und das Unterbleiben der Mitwirkung zu vertreten haben.  
  
5.6 Sofern nichts Anderes schriftlich vereinbart ist, sind Teil-, Mehr- oder Minderlieferungen nicht zulässig.

**6\. Erfüllungsgehilfen**  
6.1 Zum Einsatz von Subunternehmern oder sonstigen Erfüllungsgehilfen für die Erbringung der vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen ist der Lieferant nur nach unserer vorigeren schriftlichen Zustimmung berechtigt. Dies gilt nicht für freie Mitarbeiter des Lieferanten, die in die Arbeits- und Organisationsstruktur des Lieferanten eingebunden sind.  
  
6.2 Auch nach unserer Zustimmung im Sinne von Ziffer 6.1 hat der Lieferant sicherzustellen, dass Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen und freie Mitarbeiter die Vorgaben dieser AEB einhalten.  
  
6.3 Soweit der Lieferant im Rahmen der Zurverfügungstellung aller zur Durchführung eines Projekts erforderlichen personellen und sachlichen Mittel Vereinbarungen mit Dritten abschließt, erfolgt dies im eigenen Namen und auf eigene Rechnung.  
  
**7\. Eigentumssicherung, Beistellung, Werkzeuge**  
7.1 An Abbildungen, Plänen, Zeichnungen, Berechnungen, Ausführungsanweisungen, Produktbeschreibungen und sonstigen Unterlagen und Informationen behalten wir uns Eigentums- und Urheberrechte vor. Derartige Unterlagen und Informationen sind ausschließlich für die vertragliche Leistung zu verwenden und nach Erfüllung des Vertrags an uns zurückzugeben. Gegenüber Dritten sind die Unterlagen geheim zu halten, und zwar auch nach Beendigung des Vertrags. Die Geheimhaltungsverpflichtung erlischt erst, wenn und soweit das in den überlassenen Unterlagen enthaltene Wissen allgemein bekannt geworden ist.  
  
7.2 Ziffer 7.1 gilt entsprechend für Stoffe und Materialien die wir dem Lieferanten zur Herstellung beistellen. Derartige Gegenstände sind – solange sie nicht verarbeitet werden – auf Kosten des Lieferanten gesondert zu verwahren, zu bezeichnen und zu verwalten sowie in üblichem Umfang gegen Zerstörung und Verlust zu versichern. Bei Wertminderung oder Verlust ist vom Lieferanten Ersatz zu leisten.  
  
7.3 Sofern wir Stoffe und Materialien beim Lieferanten beistellen, wird die Verarbeitung oder Umbildung durch den Lieferanten für uns vorgenommen. Wird unsere Vorbehaltsware mit anderen, uns nicht gehörenden Gegenständen verarbeitet, so erwerben wir das Miteigentum an der neuen Sache im Verhältnis des Wertes unserer Sache zu den anderen verarbeiteten Gegenständen zur Zeit der Verarbeitung.

7.4 Werden von uns beigestellte Stoffe und Materialien mit anderen, uns nicht gehörenden Gegenständen untrennbar vermischt, so erwerben wir das Miteigentum an der neuen Sache im Verhältnis des Wertes der Vorbehaltssache zu den anderen vermischten Gegenständen zum Zeitpunkt der Vermischung. Erfolgt die Vermischung in der Weise, dass die Sache des Lieferanten als Hauptsache anzusehen ist, so gilt als vereinbart, dass der Lieferant uns anteilmäßig Miteigentum überträgt; der Lieferant verwahrt das Alleineigentum oder das Miteigentum unentgeltlich für uns mit der Sorgfalt eines ordentlichen Kaufmanns.  
  
7.5 Werkzeuge, Formen, Muster, Modelle, Profile, Zeichnungen, Normenblätter, Druckvorlagen und Lehren, die wir dem Lieferanten zur Verfügung stellen oder die zu Vertragszwecken gefertigt und uns durch den Lieferanten gesondert berechnet werden, bleiben unser Eigentum oder gehen in unser Eigentum über. Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, diese Gegenstände ausschließlich für die Herstellung der von uns bestellten Liefergegenstände einzusetzen. Sie sind durch den Lieferanten als unser Eigentum kenntlich zu machen und gegen unbefugte Einsichtnahme oder Verwendung zu sichern. Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, die uns gehörenden Werkzeuge zum Neuwert auf eigene Kosten gegen Feuer-, Wasser- und Diebstahlschaden zu versichern. Gleichzeilig tritt er uns schon jetzt alle Entschädigungsansprüche aus dieser Versicherung ab; wir nehmen die Abtretung hiermit an. Der Lieferant ist ferner verpflichtet, etwa erforderliche Wartungs­ und Inspektionsarbeiten an unseren Werkzeugen sowie alle Instandhaltungs- und Instandsetzungsarbeiten auf eigene Kosten rechtzeitig durchzuführen. Etwaige Störfälle hat er uns sofort anzuzeigen; unterlässt er dies schuldhaft, so bleiben Schadenersatzansprüche unberührt. Der Lieferant ist nach Aufforderung verpflichtet, die Werkzeuge und andere Gegenstände in ordnungsgemäßen Zustand an uns herauszugeben, wenn sie von ihm nicht mehr zur Erfüllung der mit uns geschlossenen Verträge benötigt werden.  
  
7.6 Die Übereignung der vom Lieferanten gelieferten Liefergegenstände an uns erfolgt unbedingt und ohne Rücksicht auf die Zahlung des Preises. Ausgeschlossen sind jedenfalls alle Formen des erweiterten oder verlängerten Eigentumsvorbehalts, so dass ein vom Lieferanten ggf. wirksam erklärter Eigentumsvorbehalt nur bis zur Bezahlung der an uns gelieferten Ware und für diese gilt.

**8\. Mängeluntersuchung**  
8.1 Für unsere Rechte bei Sach- und Rechtsmängeln der Liefergegenstände (einschließlich Falsch- und Minderlieferung sowie unsachgemäßer Montage, mangelhafter Montage-, Betriebs- oder Bedienungsanleitung) und bei sonstigen Pflichtverletzungen durch den Lieferanten gelten die gesetzlichen Vorschriften, soweit nachfolgend nichts Anderes bestimmt ist.  
  
8.2 Nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften haftet der Lieferant insbesondere dafür, dass die Liefergegenstände bei Gefahrübergang auf uns die vereinbarte Beschaffenheit haben. Als Vereinbarung über die Beschaffenheit gelten jedenfalls diejenigen Produktbeschreibungen, die – insbesondere durch Bezeichnung oder Bezugnahme in unserer Bestellung – Gegenstand des jeweiligen Vertrags sind oder in gleicher Weise wie diese AEB in den Vertrag einbezogen wurden. Es macht dabei keinen Unterschied, ob die Produktbeschreibung von uns, vom Lieferanten oder vom Hersteller stammt.  
  
8.3 Abweichend von § 442 Abs. 1 Satz 2 BGB stehen uns Mängelansprüche uneingeschränkt auch dann zu, wenn uns der Mangel bei Vertragsschluss infolge grober Fahrlässigkeit unbekannt geblieben ist.  
  
8.4 Für die kaufmännische Untersuchungs- und Rügepflicht gelten, sofern nichts anderes schriftlich vereinbart ist (z.B. Qualitätssicherungsvereinbarung), die gesetzlichen Vorschriften (§§ 377, 381 HGB) mit folgender Maßgabe: Unsere Untersuchungspflicht beschränkt sich auf Mängel, die bei unserer Wareneingangskontrolle unter äußerlicher Begutachtung einschließlich der Lieferpapiere sowie bei unserer Qualitätskontrolle im Stichprobenverfahren offen zu Tage treten (z.B. Transportbeschädigungen, Falsch- und Minderlieferung). Soweit eine Abnahme vereinbart ist, besteht keine Untersuchungspflicht. Im Übrigen kommt es darauf an, inwieweit eine Untersuchung unter Berücksichtigung der Umstände des Einzelfalls nach ordnungsgemäßem Geschäftsgang tunlich ist. Unsere Rügepflicht für später entdeckte Mängel bleibt unberührt. In allen Fällen gilt unsere Rüge (Mängelanzeige) als unverzüglich und rechtzeitig, wenn sie innerhalb von fünf Arbeitstagen, gerechnet ab Wareneingang oder bei versteckten Mängeln ab Entdeckung, beim Lieferanten eingeht.  
  
8.5 Die zum Zweck der Prüfung und Nachbesserung vom Lieferanten aufgewendeten Kosten trägt dieser auch dann, wenn sich herausstellt, dass tatsächlich kein Mangel vorlag. Unsere Schadensersatzhaftung bei unberechtigtem Mängelbeseitigungsverlangen bleibt unberührt; insoweit haften wir jedoch nur, wenn wir erkannt oder grob fahrlässig nicht erkannt haben, dass kein Mangel vorlag.

8.6 Kommt der Lieferant seiner Verpflichtung zur Nichterfüllung – nach unserer Wahl durch Beseitigung des Mangels (Nachbesserung) oder durch Lieferung einer mangelfreien Sache (Ersatzlieferung) – innerhalb einer von uns gesetzten, angemessenen Frist nicht nach, so können wir den Mangel selbst beseitigen und vom Lieferanten Ersatz der hierfür erforderlichen Aufwendungen bzw. einen entsprechenden Vorschuss verlangen. Ist die Nichterfüllung durch den Lieferanten fehlgeschlagen oder für uns unzumutbar (z.B. wegen besonderer Dringlichkeit Gefährdung der Betriebssicherheit oder drohendem Eintritt unverhältnismäßiger Schaden) bedarf es keiner Fristsetzung; der Lieferant ist unverzüglich, nach Möglichkeit vorher, zu unterrichten.  
  
8.7 Im Übrigen sind wir bei einem Sach- oder Rechtsmangel nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften zur Minderung des Kaufpreises oder zum Rücktritt vom Vertrag berechtigt. Außerdem haben wir nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften Anspruch auf Schadens- und Aufwendungsersatz.  
  
8.8 Durch Abnahme oder durch Billigung von vorgelegten Mustern oder Proben verzichten wir nicht auf Gewährleistungsansprüche.

**9\. Compliance-Grundsätze für die Zusammenarbeit**  
9.1 Der Lieferant, seine Mitarbeiter und von ihm möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen werden die vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen im Einklang mit den anwendbaren nationalen und internationalen Rechtsvorschriften erbringen. Das gilt insbesondere, jedoch nicht ausschließlich, für die anwendbaren Rechtsvorschriften der folgenden Länder: • Deutschland; • USA; • Irland; und • UK.  
  
9.2 Ferner gilt dies insbesondere, jedoch nicht ausschließlich, für die anwendbaren Rechtsvorschriften in den folgenden Rechtsgebieten: • Antikorruptionsrecht; • Kartell- und Wettbewerbsrecht; • Außenwirtschaftsrecht; • Umweltrecht; • Datenschutzrecht.  
  
9.3 Der Lieferant sichert zu, dass seine Mitarbeiter und von ihr möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen mit den Geboten und Verboten der Rechtsvorschriften vertraut sind, die auf die vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen anwendbar sind.  
  
9.4 Der Lieferant, seine Mitarbeiter und von ihm möglicherweise beauftragte Subunternehmer oder sonstige Erfüllungsgehilfen werden die vertragsgegenständlichen Leistungen insbesondere im Einklang mit den anwendbaren Rechtsvorschriften zur Bekämpfung von Korruption erbringen. Sie werden weder selbst noch über Dritte Geld, Geschenke, Einladungen oder andere unzulässige Vorteile Personen gewahren oder versprechen, die Entscheidungen im Hinblick auf uns treffen. Sie können solchen Personen nur dann Geschenke, Bewirtungen oder sonstige Vorteile anbieten oder gewahren, wenn wir vorher schriftlich zugstimmt hat.

Unberührt bleiben sonstige gesetzliche Ansprüche.  
  
10.5 Der Lieferant verpflichtet sich, eine Produkthaftpflicht-Versicherung mit einer Deckungssumme von mindestens EUR 1.000.000 pro Personenschaden / Sachschaden – pauschal – zu unterhalten; stehen uns weitergehende Schadenersatzansprüche zu, so bleiben diese unberührt.  
  
10.6 Wir sind berechtigt, im Rahmen durchzuführender Bewertungen des vereinbarten Qualitätsstandards während der üblichen Betriebs- und Geschäftsstunden nach vorheriger Anmeldung das Werk des Lieferanten zu betreten.

**11\. Schutzrechte Dritter**  
11.1 Der Lieferant gewährleistet, dass im Zusammenhang mit seiner Lieferung keine Schutzrechte Dritter in Ländern der Europäischen Union, Nordamerika oder anderen Ländern, in denen er die Produkte herstellt oder herstellen lässt, verletzt werden.

12.3 Alle von uns gewährten Unterlizenzen müssen angemessenen Schutz für das geistige Eigentum des Lieferanten an der Software vorsehen, indem gegenüber den Unterlizenznehmern / Übertragungsempfängern dieselben vertraglichen Bestimmungen verwendet werden, die der Lieferant zum Schutz des eigenen geistigen Eigentums verwendet.

**13\. Abtretung, Insolvenz des Lieferanten**  
13.1 Der Lieferant ist nicht berechtigt, seine Forderungen aus dem Vertragsverhältnis mit uns an Dritte abzutreten. Dies gilt nicht, soweit es sich um Geldforderungen handelt.  
13.2 Wir können vom Vertrag zurücktreten, wenn der Lieferant seine Zahlungen einstellt oder das Insolvenzverfahren oder ein vergleichbares gesetzliches Verfahren beantragt oder ein solches Verfahren eröffnet wird oder dessen Eröffnung mangels Masse abgelehnt wird.  
  
**14\. Kündigung, Change of Control**  
14.1 Wir sind berechtigt, die vertragliche Beziehung zum Lieferanten jederzeit durch schriftliche Erklärung unter Angabe des Grundes zu kündigen, wenn wir die bestellten Produkte in unserem Geschäftsbetrieb aufgrund bei Vertragsschluss nicht erkennbaren Umständen nicht mehr verwenden können. Dem Lieferanten werden wir in diesem Fall die von ihm erbrachte Teilleistung vergüten.

14.3 Ein Kontrollwechsel liegt vor, wenn ein Dritter oder mehrere gemeinsam handelnde Dritte mehr als 50 % der Geschäftsanteile des Lieferanten erwerben.  
  
**15\. Vertraulichkeit**  
15.1 Der Lieferant ist verpflichtet, den Inhalt unserer Geschäftsbeziehung vertraulich zu behandeln und Dritten nicht zu offenbaren oder sonst unmittelbar oder mittelbar zuganglich zu machen.  
  
15.2 Der Lieferant wird Geschäfts- und Betriebsgeheimnisse, die ihm im Zusammenhang mit unserer vertraglichen Beziehung anvertraut oder bekannt geworden sind ("Geheime Informationen"), geheim halten und vertraulich behandeln, nicht weitergeben, ausschließlich zur Durchführung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung verwenden und auch nach Beendigung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung weder für sich noch für andere verwerten.

15.3 Der Lieferant darf Geheime Informationen an seine Mitarbeiter oder an Dritte, soweit diese in die Durchführung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung eingebunden sind und die Geheimen Informationen kennen müssen, weitergeben. Soweit eine Weitergabe Geheimer Informationen hiernach zulässig ist, verpflichtet der Lieferant, die Informationsweitergabe an solche Mitarbeiter oder Dritte auf den für die Durchführung unserer Geschäftsbeziehung erforderlichen Umfang zu begrenzen. Der Lieferant verpflichtet sich, solche Mitarbeiter oder Dritte über die aufgrund unserer Geschäftsbeziehung bestehende Geheimhaltungsverpflichtung vor Bekanntgabe einer Geheimen Information zu informieren und entsprechend zur Geheimhaltung zu verpflichten, bevor die Mitarbeiter oder Dritte Zugang zu Geheimen Informationen erhalten. Der Lieferant steht für die Einhaltung der Verpflichtungen gemäß diesen AEB durch die vorgenannten Personen ein.  
  
15.4 Die Verpflichtung zur Geheimhaltung und Nicht-Weitergabe findet nur Anwendung auf Informationen, die • nicht bereits allgemein bekannt sind oder • der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Lieferanten nicht bereits vorher von uns oder auf nicht vertraulicher Basis gewahrt worden waren oder • der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Partei nicht von Dritten auf nicht vertraulicher Basis zugänglich gemacht wurden, es sei denn, dass der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Partei bekannt war, dass dieser Dritte seinerseits durch die Weitergabe eine Geheimhaltungsvereinbarung mit der anderen Partei verletzt hat.  
  
15.5 Eine Geheimhaltungspflicht besteht nicht, soweit die die Geheimen Informationen empfangende Partei gesetzlich verpflichtet ist, geheime Informationen in gerichtlichen, behördlichen oder sonstigen Verfahren zu offenbaren.  
  
15.6 Der Lieferant verpflichtet sich, auf schriftliche Anforderung von uns, jedenfalls aber spätestens mit Beendigung der vertraglichen Beziehung, sämtliche ihr im Zusammenhang der vertraglichen Beziehung überlassenen Unterlagen, Dateien und Datenträger (gleich welcher Art) sowie sämtliche Kopien oder Teile hiervon, die sich noch in seinem Besitz befinden und Geheime Informationen beinhalten oder sich auf solche beziehen, an uns zurückzugeben oder zu zerstören und die Zerstörung schriftlich zu bestätigen soweit nicht aus Gründen zwingenden Rechts oder zur Wahrung berechtigter Interessen der die Geheimen Informationen empfangenden Lieferanten ohne Gefährdung der Vertraulichkeit ein Verbleib solcher Unterlagen oder Kopien hiervon bei ihr erforderlich ist.  
  
15.7 Ohne unsere vorherige schriftliche Zustimmung darf der Lieferant in Werbematerial, Broschüren, etc. nicht auf die Geschäftsverbindung mit uns hinweisen und für uns gefertigte Liefergegenstände nicht ausstellen.

**16\. Verjährung**  
16.1 Die wechselseitigen Ansprüche der Vertragsparteien verjähren nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften, soweit nachfolgend nichts Anderes bestimmt ist.  
  
16.2 Abweichend von § 438 Abs. 1 Nr. 3 BGB beträgt die allgemeine Verjährungsfrist für Mängelansprüche drei Jahre ab Gefahrübergang. Soweit eine Abnahme vereinbart ist, beginnt die Verjährung mit der Abnahme. Die 3-jährige Verjährungsfrist gilt entsprechend auch für Ansprüche aus Rechtsmängeln, wobei die gesetzliche Verjährungsfrist für dingliche Herausgabeansprüche Dritter (§ 438 Abs. 1 Nr. 1 BGB) unberührt bleibt; Ansprüche aus Rechtsmängeln verjähren darüber hinaus in keinem Fall, solange der Dritte das Recht – insbesondere mangels Verjährung – noch gegen uns geltend machen kann.  
  
16.3 Die Verjährungsfristen des Kaufrechts einschließlich vorstehender Verlängerung gelten – im gesetzlichen Umfang – für alle vertraglichen Mängelansprüche. Soweit uns wegen eines Mangels auch außervertragliche Schadenersatzansprüche zustehen, gilt hierfür die regelmäßige gesetzliche Verjährung (§§ 195, 199 BGB), wenn nicht die Anwendung der Verjährungsfristen des Kaufrechts im Einzelfall zu einer längeren Verjährungsfrist führt.  
  
16.4 Bei Ersatzlieferung und Mängelbeseitigung beginnt die Gewährleistungsfrist für ersetzte und nachgebesserte Teile erneut, es sei denn, wir mussten nach dem Verhalten des Lieferanten davon ausgehen, dass dieser sich nicht zu der Maßnahme verpflichtet sah, sondern die Ersatzlieferung oder Mängelbeseitigung nur aus Kulanzgründen oder ähnlichen Gründen vornahm.  
  
**17\. Schlussbestimmungen**  
17.1 Soweit der Vertrag oder diese AEB Regelungslücken enthalten, gelten zur Ausfüllung dieser Lücken diejenigen rechtlich wirksamen Regelungen als vereinbart, welche die Vertragspartner nach den wirtschaftlichen Zielsetzungen des Vertrags und dem Zweck dieser AEB vereinbart hatten, wenn sie die Regelungslücke gekannt hatten.  
  
17.2 Ausschließlicher Gerichtsstand für alle Rechtsstreitigkeiten aus der Geschäftsbeziehung zwischen uns und dem Lieferanten ist Frankfurt am Main; wir sind jedoch auch berechtigt, Klage am allgemeinen Gerichtsstand des Lieferanten zu erheben.  
  
17.3 Für alle Rechtsbeziehungen zwischen uns und dem Lieferanten gilt ausschließlich das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland unter Ausschluss des Übereinkommens der Vereinten Nationen über Verträge über den internationalen Wareneinkauf (UN­Kaufrecht/CISG) vom 1. April 1980.
