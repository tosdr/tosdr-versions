All credit card transactions and such are processed with industry standard encryption through third party processors who only use your financial information and personal information for that purpose.

All such information provided to a third party is subject to their terms and conditions.

10\. Members’ and Models’ Profile
---------------------------------

Members and/or Models should be aware that all information directly provided on the Website when they create an account is public and can be viewed by all other Members and Browsers of the Website, unless otherwise stated. Even if a Member’s and/or Model’s profile does not contain any personal information, there is a possibility of identification by others through other information on the Member’s and/or Model’s profile. Accordingly, Members and/or Models should understand that they are in control of all of the information they upload on the Website and/or display on their profile and are fully responsible for any consequences arising out of such information.

11\. User Submissions
---------------------

We may provide areas on our Website where you can submit or post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.), and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such submissions and or postings are governed by the [Terms of Use](https://stripchat.com/terms) of the Website. If you use a forum, blog, user commenting features, community or other interactive sharing or social features that may be offered through our Website, you should be aware that any personal information you submit, display, or publish there is considered publicly available and can be read, collected, used, and disclosed by other users of those features, by us, and other third parties without restriction, except to the extent limited access features are available, if any. In addition, such submissions and or postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. If you submit and or post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your submission and or posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily submit and or post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have submitted and or posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information. To request removal of your personal information which you have posted or submitted in the manner stated above, send us an e-mail at [help@stripchat.com](mailto:help@stripchat.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

12\. Security of your personal data
-----------------------------------

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure. For instance, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal data, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your personal data between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal data. However, please be advised that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of personal data as we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party hackers from illegally obtaining this information.

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. We are not responsible for circumventions of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.

13\. Information we transfer
----------------------------

Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) so the processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your data outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

* a) We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
* b) Where we use service providers outside the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the European Union.
* c) Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the European Union and the US.

We may additionally, in rare occasions, transfer your personal data to a party outside the EEA where we have your prior explicit consent to do so or where such transfer is necessary for the provision of our services to you.

14\. Marketing information
--------------------------

We may process your personal data so as to inform you about existing and/or future services that may be of interest to you by sending you periodic announcements with details on existing and/or new services and/or programs.

You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes, by sending us an email at [help@stripchat.com](mailto:help@stripchat.com) or by clicking at the opt-out link at the bottom of any marketing emails we send you.

We can only use your personal data to promote our services to you if we have your explicit consent to do so, or in certain cases such as for example when you are a Member of our Website, if we consider that it is in our legitimate interest to do so. You may also occasionally receive marketing communications from our affiliates, but only provided you have given your explicit consent in receiving such communications.

Even if you inform us that you no longer wish to receive marketing material, you will still receive from us system notices and other information specifically related to your account from time to time.

15\. How long we keep your personal data for
--------------------------------------------

We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Where we no longer need to process your personal data for purposes set out in this privacy policy, we will delete your personal data from our systems. However, we may keep your data for longer if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons. If we do, we will make sure that your privacy is protected and that your data are only used for those purposes. The period for which we keep your personal information that is necessary for compliance and legal enforcement purposes varies and depend on the nature of our legal obligations and claims in the individual case.

Where permissible, we will also delete your personal data upon your request. Information on how to make a deletion request can be found under the paragraph “Your data protection rights” below.

If you have questions about our data retention practices, please contact us electronically by sending as an email at [help@stripchat.com](mailto:help@stripchat.com).

16\. Your data protection rights
--------------------------------

Subject to local law, you have certain rights regarding the personal data we collect, use or disclose and that is related to you. We want to make sure you are aware of your rights in relation to the personal data we process about you. We have described those rights and the circumstances in which they apply further below.

* **Right to Access:** This enables you to get access or receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.  
      
    
* **Right to Data Rectification and Correction:** If you believe that any of the information that we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have a right to request that we correct the inaccurate personal information.  
      
    
* **Right to be Forgotten / Erasure:** You may request that we delete your personal information if you believe that:
    
    * a) we no longer need to process your information for the purposes for which it was provided;
    * b) we have requested your permission to process your personal information and you wish to withdraw your consent; or
    * c) we are not using your information in a lawful manner.
    
      
    
* **Right to object:** You have the right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. If you exercise your right to object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedom or for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims.  
    
    You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This also includes profiling in as much as it is related to direct marketing.
    
    If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, then we shall stop the processing of your personal data for such purposes.
    
    Depending on the circumstances, we may need to restrict or cease processing your personal data altogether or, where requested, delete your personal data. Please note that if you object us processing your personal data, we may have to suspend the services we provide to you.
    
* **Right to Restriction of Processing:** You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data if:
    
    * a) it is not accurate; or
    * b) it has been used unlawfully but you do not want us to delete it; or
    * c) it is not relevant any more, but you want us to keep it for use in possible legal claims; or
    * d) you have already asked us to stop using your personal data but you are waiting for us to confirm if we have legitimate grounds to use your personal data.
    
      
    
    Please note that if you request us to restrict processing of your personal data, we may have to suspend the services we provide to you.
    
* **Right to data portability:** Where we have requested your permission to process your personal data or you have provided us with information for the purposes of entering into a contract with us, you have the right to receive the personal data you provided to us in a portable format. You may also request us to provide it directly to a third party, if technically feasible. We are not responsible for any such third party’s use of your account information, which will be governed by their agreement with you and any privacy statement they provided to you.

  

If we ask for your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that in case of a withdrawal of your consent you may no longer be able to use several functionalities of our Website and our services.

Please note that some requests to delete certain personal data will require the deletion of your account as a Member and/or Model and/or Studio Operator as the provision of Member and/or Model and/or Studio Operator accounts is inextricably linked to the use of certain personal data (e.g. your email address). Also note that it is possible that we require additional information from you in order to verify your authorization to make the request and to honor your request.

To exercise any of your rights, or if you have any other questions about our use of your personal data, please contact us electronically by sending us an email at [help@stripchat.com](mailto:help@stripchat.com) or by post at .

We endeavor to address all your requests promptly.
