**FATMAP PRIVACY POLICY**
=========================

Last updated: January 2023

We at FATMAP want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding the collection, use, sharing, retention, and transfer of your personal data. The data controller responsible for your personal data is Terrascope Limited of Berners House, 47-48 Berners Street, C/O Jag Shaw Baker, London W1T 3NF.

### **1\. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

The most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy as needed. We will update this page whenever we revise this policy. We will also provide you notice of any changes to this policy that we determine to be material. By continuing to use our services after changes are made, you are agreeing to accept the changes.

### **2\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND WHAT WE USE IT FOR**

* **Location Information** \- FATMAP uses a high-resolution 3D map to display the terrain around you or anywhere in the world. If you consent to sharing your location with FATMAP, your location may be derived from GPS, WiFi positioning and/or your IP address to use FATMAP for navigation or to enable other location-specific features such as track recording.. Your location information or location history may be used for the reasons listed below:
    

* **Displaying Your Position on the Map -** We use your location information from your device to display your current position on the map. 
    
* **Route Recording -** If you choose to record your route or outing, a detailed history of your location (in the form of a list of latitude and longitude coordinates) is saved for the duration that you explicitly choose to record. This is saved as a route recording in your FATMAP account and is accessible to you at any time on any device where you are logged in with your FATMAP account.
    
* **Location-relevant Adventure Content Recommendations -** In order to provide you with relevant adventure content, your location may be processed in order to show you adventure content, for example, routes, in areas that are relevant to you.  
    
* **Providing the FATMAP Service -** To help us understand our users and improve our services, we need to understand where people are using FATMAP. This helps us, for example, prioritise where to add more map imagery or adventure route content. To do this, we deidentify your device location and securely store it when you perform certain actions in the app, for example, searching for a location or viewing the map.  
    

* **Account and Profile Information-** You may provide us with personal information for the purpose of creating and managing your unique user profile on FATMAP.
    

* **Private Account Information -** Basic information such as your name, email address, username, and password are collected so that we can provide you access to our services and manage your FATMAP account, as well as contact you about your account or relevant FATMAP products. We do not use your contact details for marketing or advertising purposes without your explicit consent. If you do provide your consent for marketing, you may opt out at any time. We never sell, share or transmit your personal data to any other company or organisation except for the purpose of providing our services. 
    
* **Public Account Information -** Some information that you provide may be part of your public FATMAP profile. This information may include your name, photo, a description or bio, and other information that you choose to provide for the purpose of building and maintaining your public profile. This information is visible to all other FATMAP users. You can choose which information you publish on your public profile, and you can remove any content at any time by editing your profile.
    

* **Payment Information** \- When you make a payment on FATMAP, you may provide payment information such as your payment card or other payment details.  We use Payment Card Industry compliant third-party payment services and we do not store or collect payment information.
    
* **Information That You Provide To Us About Your Adventures And Outings  -** Your usage of the FATMAP product may result in you saving or submitting information about your adventures or outings. This may include waypoints or points of interest that you have saved, routes you have planned or recorded, photos you have attached to your outings or plans, the time and date you recorded an outing, or other information you provide about your adventures and outings. You can always choose which information you save in your FATMAP account. You can access this or remove it at any time. Your plans, routes or other content is never shared with anyone without your consent. You can choose to share any content you have created with anyone you like by using share features within the app.  
    

* **Information You Provide for the FATMAP Guidebook -** If you choose to submit your adventure content to the FATMAP Guidebook, you understand that this content will become public and you give FATMAP the right to display and use that content for FATMAP Guidebooks. 
    

* **Early Access (BETA) Program -** If you are part of the Early Access Program, your name and email address are stored for the purpose of distributing new application versions to you.  If you choose to send us feedback on the product as part of the beta program, this feedback will be saved and shared with members of the FATMAP product development team who will use your feedback to help improve the product. We may also use your contact details to contact you directly about your feedback. We don't share the feedback with anyone other than the FATMAP team.
