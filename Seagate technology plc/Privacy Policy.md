Supplier is hereby instructed to Process Personal Data to the extent necessary to provide the Services as set forth in the Agreement(s) and this DPA.

**2.2  CCPA Roles.** For the purposes of the CCPA/CPRA (where applicable), Supplier shall Process Personal Data as a Service Provider acting upon instructions of Seagate as a Business.

**2.3  Nondisclosure of Seagate Personal** **Information**. Supplier shall not disclose Seagate Personal Information in any manner for any purpose to any third party without obtaining prior written authorization from Seagate, other than disclosures to Sub-processors in accordance with Section 2.5 below. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event may Supplier sell or otherwise disclose Seagate Personal Information to any third party for the commercial benefit of Supplier or any third party.

**2.4  Limitations on Processing**. Supplier shall only Process Seagate Personal Information for the purposes of providing the Services to Seagate under the Agreement(s) and in accordance with Seagate's documented lawful instructions ("**Permitted Purposes**"). For these purposes, Seagate instructs Supplier to Process Seagate Personal Information for the purposes described in Annex I (Description of Transfer). Supplier shall not Process or permit the Processing of Seagate Personal Information except as necessary to provide services to Seagate in accordance with any Agreement between the parties and/or their Affiliates or other written instructions of Seagate. 

**2.5  Processing Requirements**. Supplier shall at all times: (a) Process the Personal Data solely for the Permitted Purposes; and (b) not Process Personal Data for its own purposes or those of any third party. Supplier shall not: (i) Sell or Share Personal Data; (ii) retain, use or disclose Personal Data for any purposes other than for the Permitted Purpose(s), including retaining, using or disclosing Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than performing the Services under the Agreement(s); or (iii) retain, use or disclose Personal Data outside the direct business relationship between Seagate and Supplier. Supplier certifies that it understands and will comply with the requirements and restrictions set out in this Section 2.5 and will further comply with the requirements applicable to Service Providers under the CCPA/CPRA.  Further, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the exchange of Personal Data between the Parties does not constitute a sale (as such term is defined under Data Protection Laws), nor form part of any monetary or other valuable consideration exchanged between the Parties with respect to the Agreement(s) or this DPA. In all cases, Supplier will comply with any applicable restrictions under the CPRA or other Data Protection Laws on combining Personal Data received from Seagate with Personal Data that Supplier receives from, or on behalf of, another person or persons, or that Supplier Collects from any interaction between it and a Consumer.

**2.6  Information Security Program**. Supplier will implement, maintain, monitor and, where necessary, update a comprehensive written information security program that contains appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect Seagate Personal Information against anticipated threats or hazards to its security, confidentiality or integrity (such as unauthorized access, collection, use, copying, modification, disposal or disclosure, unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental loss, destruction, acquisition, or damage or any other unauthorized form of Processing) (“**Information Security Program**”). The Information Security Program will include the requirements and measures listed in the Security Standards attached as Annex II.

**2.7  Restrictions on Sub-processors**. Supplier may disclose Seagate Personal Information to Sub-processors as necessary to perform its services for Seagate, subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 2.7. Supplier shall maintain a list of the Sub-processors to which it discloses Seagate Personal Information and will provide this list to Seagate upon Seagate’s request. As of the effective date of the Agreement(s), if applicable, a current list of Supplier’s Sub-processor(s) is included either in the Agreement(s) or in any other document provided by the Supplier to Seagate and signed by both parties, setting out the list of Sub-processor(s). Supplier shall notify Seagate at [corporatecontracts@seagate.com](mailto:corporatecontracts@seagate.com) at least **30 business days** before adding any Sub-processor to the list. If Seagate does not object to the proposed Sub-processor within **30 business days** of receipt of notice, the Sub-processor is deemed to have been approved. If Seagate objects to any Sub-processor having access to Seagate Personal Information, then Supplier shall not disclose Seagate Personal Information to the Sub-processor. If at any time either party finds a Sub-processor is not providing sufficient guarantees of security appropriate to the risk associated with the Seagate Personal Information being Processed, Seagate may in its sole discretion, remove the Sub-processor from the list. In the event a Sub-Processor is objected to or removed by Seagate, Supplier will be provided a reasonable amount of time to replace the Sub-processor. If Supplier cannot provide the Services without disclosing Seagate Personal Information to the objected to Sub-processor, then Seagate may terminate any applicable Agreement(s) between the parties and/or their Affiliates without cost or liability owed to Supplier.

**2.8  Sub-processor Compliance and Breach**. Supplier’s use of Sub-processors does not reduce Supplier’s obligation to comply with this DPA or applicable Data Protection Laws. Supplier will be liable to Seagate for performance of the services, Data Privacy Breaches and breaches of this DPA and applicable Data Protection Laws by its Sub-processors to the same extent as if Supplier breached.

**2.9  Obligations of Supplier Personnel and Sub-processors**. Supplier shall ensure that any person or Sub-processor who has access to Seagate Personal Information is bound by written privacy and data protection terms at least as restrictive as those in this DPA. Supplier shall ensure that all privacy and data protection obligations continue after their Processing for Seagate ends. This obligation continues in perpetuity, or alternatively, at least until Supplier has certified that all Seagate Personal Information has been deleted, destroyed, and is irretrievable.

**2.10  Limited Access**. Supplier shall limit access to Seagate Personal Information to Supplier Personnel or Sub-processors who require access for Supplier to perform its obligations under any Agreement(s) between the parties and/or their Affiliates or Seagate’s written instruction, who have (a) been trained on data protection and security requirements, and (b) agreed to comply with data confidentiality requirements at least as restrictive as those required by Seagate during and after their Processing for Seagate.

**2.11  Notice of Requests or Complaints**. Unless prohibited by law, Supplier shall notify Seagate at [data.protection.officer@seagate.com](mailto:data.protection.officer@seagate.com) within **2 business days** after receiving any request or complaint relating to the Processing of Seagate Personal Information, including:

i.  requests from a Data Subject for data portability, requests to access, change, delete, or restrict, and similar requests; or

ii.  complaints or allegations that the Processing infringes on a Data Subject’s rights.

**2.12  Supplier Responses**. Supplier shall not respond to any request or complaint under Section 2.11 unless expressly authorized to do so by Seagate. Supplier shall cooperate with Seagate with respect to any action taken relating to any request or complaint including, without limitation, deletion requests. Supplier shall seek to implement appropriate processes (including technical and organizational measures) to assist Seagate in responding to requests or complaints, unless prohibited by law.

**2.13  Requests for Disclosure.** Unless prohibited by law, Supplier shall immediately notify Seagate if Supplier receives any document requesting or purporting to compel the disclosure of Seagate Personal Information (such as oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, or other similar requests or processes; collectively, **“Disclosure Requests”**). If a Disclosure Request is not binding, Supplier will not respond. If a Disclosure Request is binding, Supplier shall, unless prohibited by applicable law, notify Seagate at least **48 hours** before responding so that Seagate may exercise such rights as it may have to prevent or limit the disclosure. Supplier shall exercise reasonable efforts to prevent and limit any disclosure and to preserve the confidentiality of Seagate Personal Information. Supplier shall cooperate with Seagate with respect to any action taken in response to Disclosure Request, including cooperating to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance to protect the confidentiality of the Seagate Personal Information.

**2.14  Cooperation.** Supplier shall assist Seagate in meeting its obligations under Data Protection Laws regarding (a) registration and notification; (b) accountability; (c) ensuring the security of Seagate Personal Information; and (d) fulfilling privacy and data protection impact assessments (including audits and risk assessments under Data Protection Laws) and related consultations of Supervisory Authorities.

**2.15  Participation in Regulatory Investigations**. Supplier shall assist and support Seagate in any investigation by any Supervisory Authority to the extent the investigation relates to Seagate Personal Information Processed by Supplier or Supplier’s Sub-processor.

**2.16  Notice of Potential Violations or Inability to Comply**. Supplier shall immediately notify Seagate if:

i.  Supplier has reason to believe that any instructions from Seagate regarding Processing of Seagate Personal Information would violate applicable law;

ii.  Supplier has reason to believe that it is unable to comply with any of its obligations under this DPA or Data Protection Laws and it cannot cure this inability to comply within a reasonable timeframe; or

iii.  Supplier becomes aware of any circumstances or changes in applicable law that are likely to prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under this DPA.

**2.17  Suspension or Adjustments for Compliance**. Seagate may suspend Supplier’s or Sub-processors’ Processing of Seagate Personal Information to prevent potential violations of or noncompliance with applicable law, this DPA, or any applicable Agreement(s) between the parties and/or their Affiliates related to privacy or data protection. Supplier shall cooperate with Seagate to adjust the Processing to remedy any potential violation or noncompliance. If adjustment is not possible, Seagate may terminate any applicable Agreement(s) between the parties and/or their Affiliates, without cost or liability owed to Supplier.  
 

**3.  DATA TRANSFERS**

**3.1  European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland Standard Clauses**.

i.  The parties agree that where transfer of Seagate Personal Information from Seagate to Supplier is a Restricted Transfer, then it shall be subject to the appropriate Standard Clauses, which are automatically incorporated by reference and form an integral part of this DPA as set out below:

1.  in relation to Seagate Personal Information that is protected by EU GDPR, the EU SCCs will apply as follows:

a.  Seagate will be the "data exporter" and Supplier will be the "data importer"

b.  Module Two (C2P) will apply;

c.  in Clause 7, the optional docking clause shall apply;

d.  in Clause 9 of Module Two (C2P), Option 2 will apply, and the time period for prior notice of Sub-processor changes shall be as set out in Section 7 of this DPA;

e.  in Clause 11, the optional language will not apply

f.  in Clause 17;

i.  for Module Two (C2P), Option 1 will apply, and

ii.  the EU SCCs will be governed by Irish law;

g.  in Clause 18(b), disputes shall be resolved before the courts of Ireland;

h.  Annex I of the EU SCCs shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Annex I to this DPA; and

i.  Annex II of the EU SCCs shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Annex II to this DPA.

2.  In relation to data that is protected by the UK GDPR, the EU SCCs:(i) shall apply as completed in accordance paragraph (1) above; and (ii) shall be deemed amended as specified by the UK Addendum, which shall be deemed executed by the parties and incorporated into and form an integral part of this DPA. Any conflict between the terms of the EU SCCs and the UK Addendum shall be resolved in accordance with Section 10 and Section 11 of the UK Addendum. In addition, tables 1 to 3 in Part 1 of the UK Addendum shall be completed respectively with the information set out in Annex I and II of this DPA and table 4 in Part 1 shall be deemed completed by selecting "neither party". 

3.  In relation to Seagate Personal Information that is protected by the Swiss DPA, the EU SCCs as implemented in accordance with paragraph (1) above will apply provided that: 

a.  references in the EU SCCs to "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" or the "GDPR" shall be interpreted as references to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP); 

b.  references to "EU", "Union" and "Member State law" shall be interpreted as references to Switzerland and to Swiss law, as the case may be; 

c.  the term ’member state’ shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude data subjects in Switzerland from the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland);  

d.  the EU SCC clauses should be interpreted as protecting the data of legal entities until the entry into force of the revised FADP; and  

e.  references to the "competent supervisory authority" and "competent courts" shall be interpreted as references to the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and competent courts in Switzerland. 

4.  In the event that any provision of this DPA or the Agreement(s) contradicts, directly or indirectly, the Standard Clauses, the Standard Clauses shall prevail. 

**ii.  Alternative Transfer Mechanisms:** To the extent that the Supplier adopts an alternative data export mechanism not described in this DPA (including any new version of or successor to the Standard Clauses adopted pursuant to applicable European Data Protection Law) for the transfer of Personal Data ("Alternative Transfer Mechanism"), the Alternative Transfer Mechanism shall apply instead of any applicable transfer mechanism described in this DPA (but only to the extent such Alternative Transfer Mechanism (i) complies with European Data Protection Law, (ii) extends to the territories to which Personal Data is transferred, and (iii) satisfies the notification considerations below) and (iv) the Supplier executes such other and further documents and takes such other and further actions as may be reasonably necessary to give legal effect to such Alternative Transfer Mechanism. In addition, if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or a supervisory authority with binding authority orders or determines (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this DPA cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer such Seagate Personal Information, Seagate acknowledges and agrees that subject to the notification considerations described below, the Supplier may implement any additional measures or safeguards that may be reasonably required to enable the lawful transfer of such Seagate Personal Information. The notification considerations require Supplier to notify Seagate at [data.protection.officer@seagate.com](mailto:corporatecontracts@seagate.com) at least 30 business days before implementing Alternative Transfer Mechanisms or any additional measures. If Seagate does not object to the proposed Alternative Transfer Mechanism or additional measures within 30 business days of receipt of notice, the Alternative Transfer Mechanism or the measures are deemed to have been approved. If Seagate objects to any such Alternative Transfer Mechanism or additional measures, then Supplier shall not utilize such Alternative Transfer Mechanisms or any additional measures. In the event an Alternative Transfer Mechanism or additional measure is objected to by Seagate, then Seagate in its sole discretion, may terminate any applicable Agreement(s) between the parties and/or their Affiliates without cost or liability owed to Supplier.

**iii.  Transfers out of countries with data export requirements.** If any Data Protection Laws require that further steps be taken in relation to any applicable data export restriction to permit the transfer of Seagate Personal Information to Supplier (including its Sub-processors), Supplier will comply with such data protection requirements including acquiring requisite consents or executing any applicable data transfer agreements (e.g., standard contractual clauses) or an alternative solution to ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfer. 

**iv.**  Supplier shall ensure that any Sub-processors also execute the Standard Clauses, where applicable.

**3.2  Other Jurisdiction Provisions**. Where applicable, Supplier shall comply with the Requirements for Specific Jurisdictions, attached as Annex III.  
 

**4.  COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY**

**4.1  Compliance**. Supplier shall ensure that Supplier’s and Sub-processors’ Processing of Seagate Personal Information complies with all applicable laws, self-regulatory frameworks, and contract requirements applicable to Supplier and Sub-processor. Supplier shall annually review Supplier’s and Sub-processors’ practices to ensure they comply with this DPA and with all applicable laws. Supplier shall cooperate, at its own expense, with Seagate’s requests that Supplier demonstrate compliance with the data protection and security terms referenced in this DPA.

**4.2  Records of Processing Activities.** Supplier will maintain an up-to-date record of the details of the Supplier’s representative and data protection officer, categories of Processing activities performed, information regarding cross-border data transfer, a general description of the security measures implemented in respect of the Processed data, the name, contact and Processing details of each Sub-processor of Seagate Personal Information, and, where applicable, any Sub-processors’ representative and data protection officer. Upon request, Supplier will provide an historical and current copy of this record to Seagate.

**4.3  Audit.** Supplier shall make available to Seagate, on written request, all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA, and shall allow for and contribute to audits, including onsite inspections, by Seagate or an independent third-party audit or mandated by Seagate in relation to the Processing of Seagate Personal Information. Any such independent third-party auditor shall be required to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the parties. Supplier shall remedy any non-compliance within a reasonable amount of time.
