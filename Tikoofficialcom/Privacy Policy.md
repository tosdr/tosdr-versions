Third Party Privacy Policies May Be Applicable



Our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party’s use or handling of your information once it is

shared. Instead, the privacy policies of the third party(ies) will govern. We encourage you to visit

the websites of those third parties and fully read and understand their privacy policies.



Our Site may contain links to other websites, such as Fanjoy Co. found at shop.tikoofficial.com.

Tiko disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices of third parties that may have links to

or from our website, or any framed content on our website. We encourage you to review the

privacy policies/statements of every website that you visit that collects personally identifiable

information.

Unless you opt out of certain communication features, we may use your information to

communicate with you, such as through e-mail, newsletters, and telephone. You may opt out

and/or unsubscribe to communications from Tiko at any time. See the Opt-Out Provisions and

Updating Your Information, below for applicable contact information and directions.



Your Information Will Not Be Sold



We will not sell any information you submit to us to any unrelated third-party without prior written

notice to you and an opportunity to opt-out.



Opt-Out Provisions and Updating Your Information



We value our user’s privacy and provide them with the option to “opt-out” of having their

information used for purposes not directly related to our Site. The opt-out option is available at

the time you sign up for your account. If you wish to change your opt-out preference or update

Your request will generally be responded to within three (3) business days if your inquiry is via

e-mail, or thirty (30) days if your inquiry is via United States mail.



Please note that changing your opt-out preference will only affect future activities or

communications from us. In other words, if we already provided your information to a third party

before you changed your opt-out preferences, you will need to contact the third party directly. To

opt-out of communications from our third party business partners, if any, please contact them

directly.



Information Retention and Security



We may store your information for more than one (1) year from the time of initial submission, as

well as automated personal information we collect about you.



We take reasonable security measures to protect users’ information against unauthorized access,

loss, alteration, or destruction. Despite these reasonable measures, we cannot guarantee our

security measures are impenetrable. Therefore, although we take reasonable steps to secure your

information, we cannot and do not promise or warrant that your information will always remain

secure.
