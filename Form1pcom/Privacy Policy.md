We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy practices. Our Services are intended for general audiences over the age of 16 years old. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 years old.

#### IF YOU ARE NOT AT LEAST 16 YEARS OLD, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

**2) INFORMATION COLLECTED AND MEANS OF COLLECTION.** We collect information about you from a variety of sources, including from you directly providing it to us (e.g., when you contact us or register for a specific service), from cookies and other tracking technologies that automatically collect information in the course of your use of the Services (Learn more about these trackers in our Cookie Policy) and from various third parties and public sources.

**Information you provide directly to us.** Access to web search results or other general content on our Sites does not require you to provide us any personal (e.g., name, date of birth), contact (e.g., email address, phone number) and/or account (username and password) information.

You may provide personal information to us, if you choose to:

* sign up to receive any additional services or request to receive certain communications from us;
* submit a help request, a customer services inquiry or other inquiry to us, or fill in any other forms for the purposes of receiving our Services;

* otherwise use the Services in a manner that you have requested.

Depending on which of these or any other Services you use, the personal information you provide may include your name, email address, user name, home address, telephone number, information posted by you on sites accessed via the Services and/or information provided by you in any help request or inquiry you make to us.

There is no need to provide to us, and we strongly discourage you from, providing any sensitive information about you or anyone else including, details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership or information about your health.

**Information collected via automated technologies and interactions.** As you interact with the Services, we may collect information via automated means about your computer or device, your preference settings, your location and your activities, including:

* IP address of your computer;
* Unique mobile device identifier;
* Technical information about your computer or mobile device such as type of device, mobile device ID number, screen resolution, web browser information and operating system or platform;
* Your preferences and settings (time zone, language, etc.);
* Internet provider or mobile carrier name;
* The URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting the Site;
* Information about your activity on the Services (e.g., your search queries, mis-formatted DNS entries, search results selected, clicks, pages viewed, search history, comments);
* If you are using a mobile device, your mobile device’s geographic location (specific geographic location if you’ve enabled collection of that information, or general geographic location automatically; and
* If you installed an Application, we may also collect information about that Application (e.g. the specific release date and distribution source of your Application, a unique Application ID, Application partner ID, the ads you click on, and information contained in error log files or cookies, aggregate query or click data and erroneous domain name system requests).

Third-parties who provide us with products and services may also place cookies, ad tags and/or beacons that collect the information outlined above in order to provide us with products and services including:

* Analytics tools (e.g., [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics)) allowing us to analyze the performance of our Services.
* Service features and functionalities such as those that enable videos to be played and you to connect to your social media accounts.
* Advertisers and ad networks allowing the delivery of targeted advertisements.

These third parties may also collect information about you from other sources and combine it with other information collected about you from third party websites not affiliated with us. For example, advertiser and advertising networks, as well as data analytics companies who service them, may participate in Online Behavioral Advertising and track your activity across various sites and/or devices where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you.

Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. However, our [Cookie Policy](https://form1-p.com/11/cookie.html) provides information and opt-out links to help you can control the collection of information about you on our Sites.

* These third parties may also provide us with information about your interactions with their products and services and/or activities on third party websites. For example, use of Service functions that connect to your social media account (e.g., Facebook Connect) may permit us access to your social network profile information, including your first name, last name, gender, birth date and email address, in accordance with your settings on the social network. If you choose to post information to your social media account via the Services, you will be making this information available to other users of these Services. We encourage you to be careful about revealing any sensitive details about yourself via our Services or otherwise.

**5) YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES.** You have choices when it comes to the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy. A few of those choices are set forth below and others are available in our [Cookie Policy](https://form1-p.com/11/cookie.html).

* Choices relating to information we collect. We may be required by law to collect certain personal information about you or as a consequence of any contractual relationship we have with you. Failure to provide this information may prevent us from providing certain Services or all of the Services to you.
* Online Behavioral Advertising. You can opt-out of third-party advertising-related cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, in which case our advertising should not be targeted to you. You will continue to see advertisements on our Sites. However, they will not be tailored to you. You can choose to opt-out through these (and other) sites:
    * Network Advertising Initiative ([http://www.networkadvertising.org/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/))

Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you. You can stop your location information from being collected by disabling this function within the settings available on your device.

**6) SECURITY.** We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.

**7) RETENTION.** We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose we collected it for and for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information we process, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

In some circumstances we may aggregate and de-identify your information in such a way that you may not reasonably be re-identified by us or any other company in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [ACCESS, REVIEW, REVISION & DELETION RIGHTS](#8) below for further information.

**8) ACCESS, REVIEW, REVISION & DELETION RIGHTS.** If you would like to access, review, revise or delete personal information we have collected from you, please contact us as provided [below](#12).

**Note regarding Search Results.** Our search results list and link to content that exits on web pages that are most likely not owned or controlled by us and the same or similar results are likely available through other search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo! etc.). If content about you is included in search results displayed on our Sites, it only means that the information exists on the Internet and it doesn’t mean that we endorse it or have the ability to remove content available on any other site and/or block such sites. To remove the content from the site linked to in the search results you should contact the owner of that site.

Legal rights applicable to personal data collected in the EEA. Pursuant to the [EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC) (“GDPR”) natural persons (called data subjects) are afforded certain rights regarding their personal data, including the right access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of, and receive a portable copy in a usable electronic format of your personal information. You also have the right withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us.

If you would like to exercise any of the rights outlines above rights, and the law of your jurisdiction requires us to honor that request, please send your request in writing to the address above. To assist us in processing your request in timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so. Your request should include any information relevant to your request, including, without limitation: (i) your name, email and postal address; (ii) the specific right you are asserting (e.g., removal); (iii) if you are requesting removal, a brief explanation of why you believe such information should be removed; and (iv) if you are requesting the removal of search results generated using your name as the search term (a) an explanation as to why the contents of the link you wish to have removed relate to you and (b) the URL (i.e., "web address") for each link that you are requesting to be removed.

To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies your identity. You need not provide a government-issued document; a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice. You may also obscure parts of the document such as identifying numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you. If you are requesting the removal of search results that contain photographs of you, please ensure that the identifying document includes your photograph. If you are making the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will be reviewed by form1-p.com’s legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about privacy. If, however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your complaint or concern, you may have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your country of residence.

**9) INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER.** If you are receiving the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in our servers in the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.

Further, if you are receiving the Services from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) we note you’re your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country that is not regarded as providing the same level of protection for personal information as the laws of your home country, and may be available to the government of those countries under a lawful order made in those countries. However, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

* Model Contracts. Where appropriate, we put in place specific contractual commitments in accordance with applicable legal requirements to provide adequate protections for your information. For further details, see [European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en).
* Privacy Shield. We may also transfer data to the U.S. under the [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/) framework which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EU and the US.
