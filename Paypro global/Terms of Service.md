and/or software) ("Products") which are owned by (a) us, the Seller, and sold through this

website ("Site"):



The Seller:



PayPro Global, Inc., 225 The East Mall, Suite 1117, Toronto, ON, M9B 0A9, Canada, PayPro

U.S. Inc., 500 7th Avenue, Office 06-108, New York, NY 10018, USA, or PayPro Europe Limited,

being construed accordingly), to (b) you, the purchaser (references to "you" or "your" being

construed accordingly).



1.2 By placing an order on this site you agree to abide by these conditions.



2. Instruction to Right to Revocation (Only for Consumers)



2.1 Right to revocation: as a consumer, you will have a legal "cooling off period" during which

you may revoke your order for any reason without statements of reasons. This period is up to

two weeks and commences not earlier than the delivery of this instruction. In the case of

delivery of a physical product, this period starts with the delivery of the product. The right to

revocation will be treated as exercised on the date of posting the notice of revocation or the

date of dispatching the returned product. All revocation notices must be in text form (e.g. mail,

fax, e-mail) and have to be addressed to:



PayPro Global, Inc., 225 The East Mall, Suite 1117, Toronto, ON, M9B 0A9, Canada



You can also contact us using the following address:

https://www.payproglobal.com/support_request.aspx



2.2 Please note: you have no right to revocation.



2.2.1 Where you order audio records or video records or software, where you have unsealed

the software.



2.2.2 Where you order bespoke or customized products made specifically to your order or your

needs or can not be returned because of their nature, e.g. download products.

2.3 Legal consequences: if you exercise the above right to revocation, you are required to return

the relevant products to us including fruits thereof and we are required to reimburse your

prepayments including fruits thereof (e.g. interests).



This does not apply to products, which deterioration is due solely to the inspection of the

products - like you would do it in shops. You may prevent yourself from having to pay

compensation for damaged products, if you do not make use of the products in your possession

and if you take reasonable care of the products in your possession. You have to bear the costs

of returning the products unless your order has a value of more than 40 USD. In case your order

has a value of more than 40 USD, we will only bear the costs of returning the products if you

had already made payment.



Where wrong products have been delivered to you, we will bear the costs of returning the

products regardless of the value of your order. Any compensation payments for damaged

products have to be made by you within 30 days after you have given your declaration of

revocation.



The product must be returned to the return address stated on the delivery note that was

accompanied with the product.



2.4 Please note that such right to revocation, where you order services, terminates if those

services commence with your agreement before the cooling-off period expires (e.g. download of

products).



If you require more information on your rights, you should contact customer support.



3. Offer, Acknowledgment and Acceptance



3.1 Any prices, quotations and descriptions made or referred to on this Site do not constitute an

made for that item.



3.3 An order submitted by you constitutes an offer by you to us to purchase products on these

conditions and is subject to our subsequent acceptance.

such offer is expressly accepted by us dispatching your order.

reserve our right to claim more damages occurred due to your default.

software product you purchased, without additional information to you. As a result of this, the

vendor can claim the receivable from you.

proprietary rights of any third party.

and other information on the site or made available by us are intended to represent no more

for us to remedy the defect.

product from your computer and destroy any digital or disk copies of the product.

of the products. If you are not a consumer, your rights hereunder shall expire after 12 months

after the delivery of the products.

where agreed otherwise) be negated or rendered void where:



13.7.1 Products have been repaired or altered by persons other than the manufacturer, us or

any authorized dealer; and/or

maintenance or installation, or failure to observe any manufacturers' instructions or other

directions issued or made available by us in connection with the delivered products.



13.8 In case you consider that you have a right to rescind the contract, please tell us the reason

for this rescission. We will check back with the vendor's applicable procedures.

acquisition, carriage or use of the Products by you, you shall obtain such license or consent at

your own expense and if necessary produce evidence to us on demand. Failure so to do shall

not entitle you to withhold or delay payment of the price. Any additional expenses or charges

incurred by us resulting from such failure shall be met by you.

laws and regulations in the Territory or other relevant jurisdiction where you take delivery or use

allowance). You may be subject to customs charges, import duties and taxes, levied when the

or import duties or taxes must be met by you since we have no control over what these charges

are. You should contact the local customs office in the relevant jurisdiction for further

information on customs policies or duties.

same by hand delivery, pre-paid post, fax or e-mail to the latest address and contact that one

party has notified in writing to the other. This will also be to address for service of legal

proceedings in the manner prescribed by law.
