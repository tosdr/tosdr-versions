The Data Protection Office
--------------------------

Teachit has established a Data Protection Office to oversee the activities we undertake to ensure that your personal data is handed ethically and in line with our legal obligations. If you have any questions about the way in which we collect, hold or process your data please send them to our Data Protection Office at [dpo@teachit.co.uk](mailto:dpo@teachit.co.uk?subject=Teachit%20GDPR%20enquiry).

What is personal data?
----------------------

“Personal data” is any information about a living individual, which allows them to be identified from that data (for example a name, photographs, videos, email address, or address).  Identification can be by directly using the data itself or by combining it with other information.

The processing of personal data is governed by legislation relating to personal data, which applies in the United Kingdom including the Data Protection Act 2018 and other legislation relating to personal data and rights such as the Human Rights Act.

How we keep your data secure
----------------------------

We have put appropriate organisational safeguards and security measures in place to protect your data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We keep your data confidential within a secure infrastructure protected by multiple firewalls and we are committed to keeping the security of these systems as up-to-date and as secure as possible. We also limit access to your personal data to those employees, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know it. They will only be permitted to process your data on our instructions and will always be subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We require any third party who is contracted to process your personal data on our behalf to have security measures in place to protect your data and to treat such data in accordance with the law. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and the UK Information Commissioner of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

The data we collect about you
-----------------------------

The following groups of personal data may be collected and processed by Teachit:

* **Identity Data** such as your first name, last name, title, member ID;
* **Contact Data** such as your e-mail address, address, and telephone number;
* **Financial Data** such as your bank account details;
* **Transaction Data** such as details of the services you have obtained from us, purchase order details, and payments made to/from us;
* **Technical Data** such as your internet protocol (IP) address, login data, operating system and platform;
* **Marketing Data** such as your marketing and communication preferences in receiving communications from us and our third parties, the technologies used, and any related correspondence;
* **Usage Data** such as your use of our website, performance and other communication data;
* **Survey Data** such as your comments and opinions provided in response to a survey.

In addition, we may collect the following additional groups of data with respect to job applicants, employees or ex-employees, contractors, and temporary employees:

* **Identity Data** such as proof of your identity (e.g. passport, valid driving licence or birth certificate);
* **Contact Data** such as information about your marital status, next of kin, dependants, personal and emergency contacts details to be used in the event of an emergency;
* **Recruitment Data** such as details of your education, qualifications, occupation, work history, experience, referees, training and skills development;
* nationality, entitlement to work in the UK, criminal record (if your role requires this) and equal opportunities monitoring information;
* **Employment Data** such as the terms and conditions of your employment, salary or fee payments, benefits, work patterns, NI number, attendance, holidays, sickness, disciplinary or grievance issues, medical or health conditions, disabilities (for which Teachit needs to make reasonable adjustments); and information about your vehicle, driving licence, MOT and insurance documents if you drive on company business;

* **Activity Data** such as the websites our employees visit while using a Teachit computer or Teachit network, and the activity logs held within Teachit systems and databases;
* **Communications Data** such as the emails you send or receive via the Teachit email system.

We also collect, use and share **aggregated data** such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is anonymous and is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

How we collect your data
------------------------

We may collect personal data from you when you: use our website, app, products or services or interact with us through social media, email, post, text or phone. In addition, we will also collect personal data from job applicants, employees, ex-employees, trustees, contractors and temporary employees during their recruitment screening and throughout the tenure of their employment with us.

Teachit does not carry out covert monitoring or surveillance (that is, where you are unaware that the monitoring or surveillance is taking place) unless, in highly exceptional circumstances, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that criminal activity or extremely serious malpractice is taking place and, after suitable consideration, Teachit reasonably believes there is no less intrusive way to tackle the issue.

Any covert monitoring or surveillance will be carried out for a limited and reasonable period of time consistent with the objectives of the monitoring or surveillance and will relate only to the specific suspected criminal activity or extremely serious malpractice.

The legal basis for processing your personal data
=================================================

The law requires us to inform you of the legal basis for collecting and processing your personal data, where we are the Data Controller, or Joint Data Controller. These include:

* **Performance of contract:** In most cases, this occurs when we have a contract with you to either provide a product or service to you, or to receive something from you. Examples include: employment contracts; agreements for the provision of our products or services; and procurement contracts. We are also acting under the performance of contract if we collect or process your data for the purposes of entering into a contract, if you have expressed an interest in working with us.

* **Legitimate interests:** We may have a legitimate interest in processing certain personal data, which does not relate to the performance of a contract agreed with you. If we rely on our legitimate interests to justify processing your data, we will have conducted an assessment to evaluate the fairness of this; and will only undertake the processing if it is reasonable to do so and will not cause undue risk to you.

* **Legal obligation:** We may be legally obliged to process certain data about you.

* **Consent:** In general, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to individuals via email or text message. Where we would like to be able to contact you about our products and services, and no other legal basis applies, we will seek your consent to retain and re-use your contact details for that purpose. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting our Data Protection Officer at [dpo@teachit.co.uk](mailto:dpo@teachit.co.uk?subject=Teachit%20GDPR%20enquiry)**.**

Your Rights
-----------

You have several rights under the data privacy legislation - details of each of these rights are set out below.

You have the right to:

* **Access your data:** You can access the data we hold on you at any time, by making a Subject Access Request. The more specific you can be about what you want to know, the better. We will need to confirm your identity before we release data to you.

* **Rectify your data:** You can ask us to correct any data we hold about you that is inaccurate.

* **Request erasure:** You have the right to ‘be forgotten’, in certain circumstances. This right does not apply if it would prevent the performance of a contract with you or if there is another legal requirement for us to retain your data. If erasure is not possible, you may be able to ask us to restrict processing.

* **Request the restriction of processing of your data:** You may ask us to suspend the processing of your data under certain circumstances, for example pending a review of the accuracy of the data or after you have objected to our use of the data, and we need to establish whether we may lawfully continue processing it.

* **Request the transfer of your data:** In some cases, you can ask us to transfer the data you originally provided to us to yourself or to another company. This only applies to data you provided directly, or that we observed about you through automated means.

* **Object to the processing of your data:** You can object to our processing of your data for direct marketing purposes, or on the basis of our stated legitimate interests (defined in the table above). In some cases, we may have compelling lawful grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms.

* **Object to automated decision-making:** You can also object to the processing of your personal data where profiling is being used to make assumptions about your behaviours or preferences; for example, to target marketing communications. You have the right not to be subject to automated decision-making and can require that any such decisions are reviewed by a human.

* **You can lodge a complaint:** If you believe your data is being handled in a way that breaches data protection legislation, you can lodge a complaint with us directly. You also have the right to complain to the UK Information Commissioner. Please be aware that we take the handling of your personal data very seriously. As such, we would always appreciate the opportunity to address any concerns you may have directly with you.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, or lodge a complaint please contact our Data Protection Office at [dpo@teachit.co.uk](mailto:dpo@teachit.co.uk?subject=Teachit%20GDPR%20enquiry). You will not normally have to pay a fee, however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will always try to respond to any legitimate request within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
