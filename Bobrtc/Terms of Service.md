TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT POLICY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bodis facilitates the monetization of certain domain names, as well as the sale and purchase of domain names, and provides various services in relation to such transactions. Bodis is NOT responsible for and has NO control over the use of any domain name listed for sale, nor does it have any underlying control over the actual domain names it provides services for, as it does not own or manage those domain names directly. Contacting the domain owner directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community. You may also file an Infringement Takedown Request Form using the link below to ensure that your complaint can be evaluated by our legal department:

[https://www.bodis.com/takedown-request](https://www.bodis.com/takedown-request)

All complaints should contain the information requested in our online Infringement Takedown Request Form. Failure to include necessary information may limit our ability to deal with your claims and may result in your complaint being denied. We may provide the account/domain holder with your contact information, including the email address and the name of the trademark owner, and/or details of the complaint, in accordance with our Term of Service and Privacy Policy.

A report alleging infringement or violation of legal rights must come from the trademark owner or someone authorized to report on their behalf. If you aren't the trademark owner or an authorized representative, we won't be able to process your complaint.

In addition, we won’t be able to process your complaint unless you certify that: (a) you have a good faith belief that the reported use of the trademark described above, in the manner complained of, is not authorized by the trademark owner, its agent, or the law; (b) you state under penalty of perjury that the information supplied is accurate, and that you are the trademark owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the trademark owner; and (c) you acknowledge that all information submitted in your trademark infringement notification may be forwarded to the domain or Bodis account holder.

Before submitting a complaint, please be aware that intentionally submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may lead to liability for damages under laws as may be applicable in some countries.

Once we have received your complaint, we will conduct a review and issue our decision to both you and the account holder associated with the complained of domain name(s).

The trademark complaint procedure can also be found in our Infringement Notification Policy (Schedule E) of our Terms of Service:

COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
----------------------

Any content placed on a webpage accessed through or via a domain name is the responsibility of the owner. Bodis does not provide webpage content creation services, or any other similar services, but merely provides domain monetization and services related to the sale and purchase of domains. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that copyright infringement claims will apply. However, Bodis provides you with the following information regarding claims of infringement and our policy for handling any such claims we may receive. Again, contacting the domain owner directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community.
