#### Digital Millennium Copyright Act

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any content posted by a user of this Site infringes upon your copyright, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):

* a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
* identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
* identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;
* information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address;
* a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

OSF’s designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is: [contact@opensocietyfoundations.org](mailto:contact@opensocietyfoundations.org). You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.

Counter-Notice. If you believe that your posting that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your posting, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

* your physical or electronic signature;
* identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
* a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
* your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in New York, New York, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, OSF may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.

#### Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated. OSF, in its sole discretion, may terminate your access to or use of the Site, at any time and for any reason, including if OSF believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement. Upon any such termination, your right to use the Site will immediately cease. You agree that any termination of your access to or use of the Site may be effected without prior notice, and that OSF may immediately deactivate or delete your password and user-name, and all related information and files associated with it, and/or bar any further access to such information or files. You agree that OSF and the Affiliated Entities shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Site or to any such information or files, and shall not be required to make such information or files available to you after any such termination.

#### Governing Law; Venue

This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without regards to its principles of conflicts of law. You agree to exclusive jurisdiction by the federal and state courts located in the County of New York in the State of New York, U.S.A., and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.

#### Miscellaneous

This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and OSF or any Affiliated Entities. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision. You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. OSF may assign, transfer, or sublicense any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption, or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. This, together with all policies referred to herein, is the entire Agreement between you and OSF relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and OSF relating to such subject matter. Notices to you may be made via posting to the Site, by email, or by regular mail, in OSF's discretion. The Site may also provide notices of changes to this Agreement or other matters by displaying such notices or by providing links to such notices. Without limitation, you agree that a printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
