You are solely responsible for the proper protection and storage of assigned password and log-in (credentials). **text|** may, at its sole discretion, provide advance notice before such actions, but is not obligated to do so.

2.6. You are responsible for compliance with the provisions of the Agreement by you, Agents, Guest-Users and End-Users and for any and all activities that occur under your Account.

Any questions, concerns or disputes that arise based on Customer’s use of Supporting Application should be addressed with the provider of such Supporting Application. **text|** does not warrant, or support Supporting Application, whether or not they are designated by **text|** as developer or otherwise. **text|** is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by such Supporting Application or its provider. **text|** cannot guarantee the continued availability of any functionality or feature that is made available as the outcome of integration with any Supporting Application and may cease providing them without notice and without entitling the Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation.

Legal stuff made easy

When setting up an Account, make sure all the info you provide about yourself is spot-on and up-to-date. You decide who operates the Services for you and on your behalf. Still, it's essential to note that you remain the contracting party tied to this Agreement.

You are responsible for ensuring that your Agents and Guest-Users or people use their login credentials properly. We use login credentials to identify and authenticate Agents and Guest-Users in the Services. It is important that You protect your login credentials and not share them with others.

Our Services are 16+ only. This means that everyone who uses our Services, must be at least 16 years old and Customers must ensure that no one younger than 16 years of age access or use the Services. If we find out that someone underage is using our Services, we'll have to revoke their Account and we reserve the right to delete their data. We don't make the rules, we just enforce them. But hey, you can always come back when you're old enough!

You're in charge of making sure everyone using your Account – you, Agents, and Guest-Users and End-Users – follows the rules in the Agreement. This includes using our Services to store and transmit Customer Data in a way that complies with the law and any other agreements you have with Agents, and Guest-Users or End-Users. If you’re subject to any regulations or restrictions and you decide to use the Services, then we won’t be liable if the Services do not meet or adhere to such rules, regulations or limitations. It's on you to ensure that the Services are compliant with those specific needs or requirements.

You acknowledge that you are responsible under the Agreement for any legal basis ex. consents and notices from End-Users required to permit **text|** processing of Customer Data (which will be deemed to include, but not be limited to, data submitted, stored, sent or received via Services by the Customer or its End-Users).  We're not responsible if you don't have the right to process and share your data with us, so it's important to do your due diligence.  
  
When integrating our Services onto your website, inform your End-Users about it. Let them know their data and chats will be stored within the Services when they interact with you on your website.

**text|’s** Marketplace offers some add-ons. If created by third-party providers, they come with their own set of rules, separate from these terms. If you get some questions or issues related to those apps, it's between you and their providers. 

Just something to bear in mind -they are optional extras and are not part of our core Services, so we cannot vouch for their long-term availability or performance.
