Cookies, cookies everywhere, right? Here you can find out why we use cookies and how you can handle them.

What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are information that is sent by us and stored on your device in your browser’s file directory. This information might be about you, your preferences, or your device, and is mostly used to make our website work as you expect it to. 

Do we use cookies?
------------------

Yes. Your browsing experience with our website should be fun and easy, and by accessing our website (as defined below) you agree to let us do our best to make your website experience more personal with ever-increasing levels of personalization and rich interactive functionality. When you, as a non-registered user to our Services (a “Visitor”) visits or browses any of our domains or subdomains operated by Text, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, the “website”) you give us and our partners your consent to store and retrieve cookies on your device to enhance your website experience, analyze its traffic and usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

What cookies are used for? 
---------------------------

Cookies are unique to your browser and can store a wide range of information (including your name, home address, email address, or telephone number, but only if you provide it).

### Advertising and Marketing cookies

These cookies are used to show you targeted ads, content, and recommendations that we and our partners believe may be relevant to you. They help us to understand your interests better, how you got to us, or know when content has been shown to you. We may also use them to help us to deliver you marketing campaigns and monitor their performance (e.g., when you visited our Help Center and then made a subscription to our Services) or to allow you to share certain pages with social networks, or to post comments on our website). These cookies store personally identifiable information.
