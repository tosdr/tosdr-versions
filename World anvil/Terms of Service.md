**4\. Copyright**

World Anvil is, unless otherwise stated, the owner of all copyright and data rights in the Service and its contents. Individuals who have posted works to World Anvil are either the copyright owners of the component parts of that work or are posting the work under license from a copyright owner or his or her agent or otherwise as permitted by law. You may not reproduce, distribute, publicly display or perform, or prepare derivative works based on any of the Content including any such works without the express, written consent of World Anvil or the appropriate owner of copyright in such works. World Anvil does not claim ownership rights in your works or other materials posted by you to World Anvil (Your Content).

**4a. Your Content's Copyright**

World Anvil makes no claim to any of your content and will never use it for anything without your permissions apart from displaying it in the pages of the service or any other third party that you have chosen to make the content available to (Read section 4). World Anvil will, at the best of its abilities, provide you with the means to prove any copyright infringment claim you wish to make against any other part. World Anvil strongly believes that the creators should be the sole owners of the content created and should always receive credit when due.

  

**5\. Reporting Copyright Violations**

At World Anvil's discretion and in appropriate circumstances, World Anvil may remove Your Content submitted to the Site, terminate the accounts of users or prevent access to the Site by users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe the copyright in your work or in the work for which you act as an agent has been infringed through this Service, please contact World Anvil's agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement, Daniel Sowers who can be reached through [\[email protected\]](https://www.worldanvil.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner.
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

2. If a subscription has been purchased without your prior knowledge and it is reported within the first 14 days of the purchase World Anvil will refund the purchase.

Users with access to CSS editing of the website are not permitted to alter the content and/or the design of the header and the footer of World Anvil. Any change will be penalised and be dealt in person by person case. This might lead to denial of use of CSS features, deletion of CSS code and/or permanent ban from the website.

**23\. Lifetime membership**

A lifetime membership is defined as a membership that lasts for the lifetime of this product or 30 years, whichever is less. Lifetime members are not excluded from World Anvil's terms or service or website etiquette rules - they are still subject to all #rules, terms and obligations of World Anvil as well as repercussions for breaking said terms.

* Lifetime Membership upgrades from Lifetime Grandmaster to Lifetime Sage are prorated. This is the only upgrade that can be performed on a Lifetime Membership.
* Lifetime Membership downgrades are not possible at any point after purchase.
* Lifetime Memberships cannot be transferred or sold to another user once purchased. An account with a Lifetime Membership attached to it cannot be transferred or sold to another user.
* As with all World Anvil memberships, Lifetime Memberships are considered used at the point of activation, and you, the customer, waive your rights to any refund that would have been otherwise related to a physical product.
