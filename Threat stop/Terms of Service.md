**7\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.**

**7.1** ThreatSTOP shall defend any action brought against Customer to the extent it is based on a third party claim that use by Customer of the Licensed Software as furnished hereunder, which use is in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, directly infringes any valid United States patent, copyright, or trade secret.  ThreatSTOP shall pay any liabilities, costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) finally awarded against Customer in such action that are attributable to such claim, provided: (a) Customer notifies ThreatSTOP in writing of any such claim within twenty (20) days of learning of such claim; (b) ThreatSTOP has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (c) Customer cooperates with ThreatSTOP, at ThreatSTOP’s expense, in defending or settling such claim (provided that ThreatSTOP shall not enter into any settlement or other compromise that materially adversely affects Customer without Customer’s written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).  In addition to the foregoing, Customer agrees to promptly notify ThreatSTOP of any known or suspected infringement or misappropriation of ThreatSTOP’s proprietary rights of which Customer becomes aware.  Should the Licensed Software or the ThreatSTOP Service become, or be likely to become in ThreatSTOP’s opinion, the subject of any claim of infringement, ThreatSTOP may, at its option: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the potentially infringing materials; (ii) replace or modify the potentially infringing materials to make them non-infringing; or (iii) terminate this Agreement.  

**7.2** ThreatSTOP shall have no liability for, and Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold ThreatSTOP harmless from and against, any claim based upon: (i) the use, operation, or combination of the Licensed Software or the ThreatSTOP Service with non-ThreatSTOP programs, data, equipment, or documentation if liability would have been avoided but for such use, operation, or combination; (ii) use of other than the then-current, unaltered version of the Licensed Software or ThreatSTOP Service; (iii) Customer’s activities after ThreatSTOP has notified Customer that ThreatSTOP believes such activities may result in infringement; (iv) any modifications to or markings of the Licensed Software or the ThreatSTOP Service that are not specifically authorized in writing by ThreatSTOP; (v) any third party software; (vi) any Customer Data or other Customer materials; or (vii) Customer’s breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.  Customer shall pay any liabilities, costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) awarded against ThreatSTOP in such action that are attributable to such claim provided: (x) ThreatSTOP notifies Customer in writing of any such claim within twenty (20) days of learning of such claim; (y) Customer has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations (provided that Customer shall not enter into any settlement or other compromise that materially adversely affects ThreatSTOP without ThreatSTOP's written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned); and (iii) ThreatSTOP cooperates with Customer, at Customer’s expense, in defending or settling such claim.  This Section 7 states the entire liability of ThreatSTOP and the exclusive remedy of Customer with respect to infringement of any intellectual property or other rights, whether under theory of warranty, indemnity, or otherwise.

Customer will notify ThreatSTOP immediately of any unauthorized use of Customer’s ThreatSTOP Service account or any other breach of security regarding Customer’s ThreatSTOP Service account.
2. **2** If Customer ordered the ThreatSTOP Service through a Reseller, Customer shall contact such Reseller for all support for the ThreatSTOP Service.  If Customer contracts ThreatSTOP for support services that Customer should have sought from a Reseller, ThreatSTOP will refer the Customer to its Reseller to provide such support.  If Customer ordered or is ordering the ThreatSTOP Service directly from ThreatSTOP, ThreatSTOP shall provide support for the ThreatSTOP Service to Customer at no additional charge in accordance with the support guidelines set forth in the Documentation, the User Interface, and on ThreatSTOP’s public website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no support services are provided for free trial versions of the ThreatSTOP Service. 
3. **3** ThreatSTOP will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the ThreatSTOP Service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (a) planned downtime (of which ThreatSTOP will give at least 8 hours notice via the ThreatSTOP Service and which ThreatSTOP will schedule to the extent practicable during the weekend hours from 6:00 p.m. Friday to 3:00 a.m. Monday Pacific Time), or (b) any unavailability resulting from an event of Force Majeure. 

**9\. CONFIDENTIALITY****.**

**9.1** “Confidential Information” includes, without limitation, the Documentation, Licensed Software, ThreatSTOP Service and results of ThreatSTOP Service comparative performance benchmarks, passwords provided to Customer for ThreatSTOP Service access, Customer Data, information related to past, present or future research, development or business affairs, any proprietary products, materials or methodologies, and any other information that which by its nature is normally and reasonably considered confidential or provides the disclosing party with a competitive advantage.  Confidential Information other than that described in the preceding sentence, shall be marked as confidential or proprietary or, if disclosed verbally, shall be identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure. The receiving party shall protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care that it regularly uses to protect its own Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party shall use the Confidential Information only for the limited purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not be provided or disclosed to anyone except those employees or contractors of the receiving party with a need to know in connection with the exercise of the receiving party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement who agree to be bound by these terms.  Confidential Information and any and all authorized copies thereof shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be destroyed or returned if requested by the disclosing party. 

**9.2** Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement, neither party shall be required to maintain in confidence any of the following: (i) information that, at the time of disclosure to the receiving party, is in the public domain; (ii) information that, after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain without restriction, except by breach of this Agreement; (iii) information that was in the receiving party’s possession at the time of disclosure, and which was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing party; (iv) information that the receiving party can demonstrate resulted from its own research and development, independent of and without reference to disclosure from the disclosing party; (v) information that the receiving party receives from third parties, provided such information was not obtained by such third parties from the disclosing party on a confidential basis; or (vi) information that is produced in compliance with applicable law or a court order, provided the other party is given reasonable notice of such law or order and an opportunity to attempt to preclude or limit such production.

**9.3** Customer acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of ThreatSTOP’s Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law to compensate ThreatSTOP for the breach of this Section 9 or of Sections 2, 3, or 4; that any such breach will allow Customer or third parties to compete unfairly with ThreatSTOP resulting in irreparable harm to ThreatSTOP that would be difficult to measure; and, therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, ThreatSTOP shall be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief (without the necessity of proving actual damages or of posting a bond), in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law, hereunder, or otherwise.

**10\. NO WARRANTIES.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND THREATSTOP SERVICE ARE PROVIDED **“AS IS”**, AND THREATSTOP DOES NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE RELATED TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND THREATSTOP SERVICE AND CUSTOMER’S USE OR INABILITY TO USE THEM, THE RESULTS OF THEIR USE AND THIS AGREEMENT.  This disclaimer shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its essential purpose.

**11\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

**11.1** EXCEPT (I) WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 7 (INFRINGEMENT INDEMNITY), OR (II) FOR DAMAGES RELATED TO CLAIMS BASED ON A BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 (CONFIDENTIALITY), THREATSTOP’ LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE THREATSTOP SERVICE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE THREATSTOP SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT THAT RESULTED IN SUCH CLAIM.  

**11.2** EXCEPT (I) WITH RESPECT TO  SECTION 7 (INFRINGEMENT INDEMNITY); (II) DAMAGES RELATED TO CLAIMS BASED ON EITHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 (CONFIDENTIALITY); OR (III) DAMAGES RELATED TO EITHER PARTY’S UNAUTHORIZED USE, DISTRIBUTION, OR DISCLOSURE OF THE OTHER PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, HOWEVER ARISING, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**12\. TERM AND TERMINATION.** 

**12.1** This Agreement is effective upon the Effective Date and unless sooner terminated by either party in accordance with this Section 12, shall remain effective for the Initial Term, and shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal within sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term. 

**12.2** Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately upon written notice if the other party: (i) becomes insolvent or ceases doing business for a period greater than ninety (90) days; or (ii) materially breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days following written notice to such party.  Additionally, ThreatSTOP may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Customer in the event that ThreatSTOP has not received payment for the ThreatSTOP Service provided to Customer for the then-current term, regardless of whether Customer has made payment to a Reseller.

**12.4** The provisions of Sections 1 (Definitions), 3 (License Restrictions), 4 (Ownership), 5 (Fees), 7 (Intellectual Property Infringement), 8.1 (Customer Responsibilities), 9 (Confidentiality), 10 (No Warranties), 11 (Limitation of Liability), 12.4 (Survival) and any other term that by its nature ought to survive termination will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

**12.5** Upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement: (i) ThreatSTOP will immediately cease providing the ThreatSTOP Service to Customer; (ii) Customer’s license to use the ThreatSTOP Service, and the Licensed Software through the ThreatSTOP Service will cease; (iii) any and all payment obligations of Customer incurred prior to the date of termination will immediately become due; and (iv) within thirty (30) days of such termination each party will return all copies of Confidential Information of the other party in its possession, except as permitted by this Agreement or required to comply with any applicable legal or accounting record keeping requirement.

No purchase order, other ordering document or any hand written or typewritten text which purports to modify or supplement the printed text of this Agreement or any Order Form shall add to or vary the terms of this Agreement unless signed by authorized representatives of each party.  However, to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail; provided, however, that an Order Form submitted through a Reseller must be pre-approved by ThreatSTOP in writing.
