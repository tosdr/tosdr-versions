Сarrying out such activities, we comply with the legal provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), and data protection provisions of other regions where Admixer services are in use. For Admixer, the protection of personal data is very serious and we strictly comply with the data privacy laws.

Users’ data is processed by Admixer EU GmbH (Graf-Luckner-Höhe 37, ESSEN, NORDRHEIN-WESTFALEN, 45239, GERMANY) (service provider and data controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation). Our services are intended for the general public and not for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users who are considered children under their respective national laws. This document also applies to technologies that we embed within the framework of our ad-serving services on third-party resources (websites and applications) through which we receive the information.

**What is personal information?**
---------------------------------

According to Art.4 No. 1 GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, therefore can be used to obtain personal or factual details about the data subject (such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth or e-mail address). Information that cannot (directly or indirectly) be associated with a natural person (or only with disproportionate effort), for example, anonymous information, is not personal information.

We specialize in displaying ads that are relevant to users. For maximum ad relevance, we use collected data about devices, sessions and resources used by users, as well as information about interaction with advertising creatives. We only use anonymized identifiers for these purposes – cookies and mobile advertising IDs.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small files that are placed on your browser to store information. Cookies are mainly used to adapt the operation of the website to your expectations, offering a more personalized browsing experience and memorizing the choices you made previously.

There are various types of cookies. Cookies do not record or store any personal data from your device.

* **Technical cookies** are necessary and help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies; therefore, it is not possible to refuse them.
* **Preference cookies** are used to keep track of your most preferable settings of websites. Preference cookies enable a website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.
* **Statistic cookies** are used by analytical services to track and analyze users’ engagements with online sources in order to improve their services. Statistic cookies help website owners to understand how visitors interact with websites by collecting and reporting information anonymously.
* **Advertising cookies** are set by us or our advertising partners and us to provide you with relevant ads and to understand that content’s effectiveness. They may be used to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites to predict your preferences and to display more relevant advertisements to you. These types of cookies also enables showing of remarketing ads (advertising of brands whose sites you visited)

**Admixer partners’ cookies**

As a part of advertising eco-system Admixer fulfill delivery of ads provided by our direct advertisers and external partners.  In case of third-party ad delivery advertising cookies of these parties could be used in accordance with our partners’ policies.

**Google advertising cookies. How Google uses cookies in advertising:**

Working with Google and its partners, Google may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).

Google stores a record of the ads Google serves in their logs. These server logs typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. Google stores this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve services and to maintain the security of systems. Google anonymizes this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).

We use Google services and share information with Google.
