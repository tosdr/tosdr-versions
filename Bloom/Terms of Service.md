Welcome to Bloom! Meemo Media, Inc. (“Bloom”) provides our website located at [www.dailybloom.app](https://www.enjoybloom.com/www.dailybloom.app) (the “Site”) and our learning videos accessible via our mobile device application (“App”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services and App are collectively called the “Services.” Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of our Services.

​

Agreement to Terms

Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users.

​

Changes to Terms or Services

We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

​

​​

Dispute Resolution

​

Governing Law

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

​

AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE

YOU AND BLOOM AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF OR THE USE OF THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR CONTENT (COLLECTIVELY, “DISPUTES”) WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT EACH PARTY RETAINS THE RIGHT: (I) TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND (II) TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION OR VIOLATION OF A PARTY’S COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS, PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (THE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THE FOREGOING CLAUSE (II), AN “IP PROTECTION ACTION”). WITHOUT LIMITING THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ANY OTHER DISPUTE IF YOU PROVIDE BLOOM WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR DESIRE TO DO SO BY EMAIL AT [SUPPORT@WATCHPLAYBOOK.COM](mailto:SUPPORT@WATCHPLAYBOOK.COM) WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FOLLOWING THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO THESE TERMS (SUCH NOTICE, AN “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE”). IF YOU DON’T PROVIDE BLOOM WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE WITHIN THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN CLAUSES (I) AND (II) ABOVE. THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY IP PROTECTION ACTION OR, IF YOU TIMELY PROVIDE BLOOM WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE, WILL BE THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN SUCH COURTS. UNLESS YOU TIMELY PROVIDE BLOOM WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BLOOM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND BLOOM OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS HELD UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION WILL BE DEEMED VOID. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.

​

ARBITRATION RULES

THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE “AAA RULES”) THEN IN EFFECT, EXCEPT AS MODIFIED BY THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION. (THE AAA RULES ARE AVAILABLE AT [WWW.ADR.ORG/ARB\_MED](http://www.adr.org/ARB_MED) OR BY CALLING THE AAA AT 1-800-778-7879.) THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT WILL GOVERN THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS SECTION.

​

ARBITRATION PROCESS

A PARTY WHO DESIRES TO INITIATE ARBITRATION MUST PROVIDE THE OTHER PARTY WITH A WRITTEN DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION AS SPECIFIED IN THE AAA RULES. (THE AAA PROVIDES A GENERAL DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION FORM AND A SEPARATE FORM FOR DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.) THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE EITHER A RETIRED JUDGE OR AN ATTORNEY LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW AND WILL BE SELECTED BY THE PARTIES FROM THE AAA’S ROSTER OF ARBITRATORS. IF THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO AGREE UPON AN ARBITRATOR WITHIN SEVEN (7) DAYS OF DELIVERY OF THE DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION, THEN THE AAA WILL APPOINT THE ARBITRATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AAA RULES.

​

ARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE

UNLESS YOU AND BLOOM OTHERWISE AGREE, THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED IN THE COUNTY WHERE YOU RESIDE. IF YOUR CLAIM DOES NOT EXCEED $5,000, THEN THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU AND BLOOM SUBMIT TO THE ARBITRATOR, UNLESS YOU REQUEST A HEARING OR THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THAT A HEARING IS NECESSARY. IF YOUR CLAIM EXCEEDS $5,000, YOUR RIGHT TO A HEARING WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE AAA RULES. SUBJECT TO THE AAA RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO DIRECT A REASONABLE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BY THE PARTIES, CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPEDITED NATURE OF THE ARBITRATION.

​

ARBITRATOR’S DECISION

THE ARBITRATOR WILL RENDER AN AWARD WITHIN THE TIME FRAME SPECIFIED IN THE AAA RULES. THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL INCLUDE THE ESSENTIAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS UPON WHICH THE ARBITRATOR BASED THE AWARD. JUDGMENT ON THE ARBITRATION AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD OF DAMAGES MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THE “LIMITATION OF LIABILITY” SECTION ABOVE AS TO THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES FOR WHICH A PARTY MAY BE HELD LIABLE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THE CLAIMANT’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. IF YOU PREVAIL IN ARBITRATION YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES, TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. BLOOM WILL NOT SEEK, AND HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO RECOVER, ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES IF IT PREVAILS IN ARBITRATION.  
 

​

Fees

Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Bloom will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

​

Changes

Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Bloom changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [feedback@watchBloom.com](mailto:feedback@watchBloom.com)) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Bloom’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Bloom in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

​

General Terms

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Bloom and you regarding the Services, Products and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Bloom and you regarding the Services, Products and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Bloom’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Bloom may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

Any notices or other communications provided by Bloom under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) by Bloom via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

Bloom’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Bloom. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
