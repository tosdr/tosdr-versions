### Securely login into Plink

If you login Plink on a private device (e.g. your own PC or tablet), we recommend that you select the option "Keep me logged in". This enables you to remain logged in for 30.0 hours without being asked to login again, if you have not interacted with the platform for a period of time. If you are using a public device, which is also used by other individuals, we recommend that you do not select this option, as information is stored in the browsers cookies, which could result in misuse.
