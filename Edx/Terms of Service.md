**Last Updated: June 26, 2023**

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in edX LLC (a [2U, Inc.](https://2u.com/about) company, also “edX”, “we”, or “us”). These Terms of Service apply to our website at www.edX.org, along with our related websites, hosted applications, mobile or other downloadable applications (collectively, the “edX Site”), and other services provided by us (collectively with the edX Site, the “Service”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and edX regarding your use of the Service.

### PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:

BY CREATING AN EDX SITE ACCOUNT (“ACCOUNT”) OR DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE [PRIVACY POLICY](https://www.edx.org/edx-privacy-policy) FOR THE SERVICE (THE “PRIVACY POLICY”) AND OTHER POLICIES AND ADDITIONAL TERMS WE REFERENCE BELOW (TOGETHER, THESE “TERMS”). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO USE THE SERVICE (AS OUTLINED IN THESE TERMS), OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND EDX’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN EDX AND YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

ARBITRATION NOTICE. Except for certain kinds of disputes as described in Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration), you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND EDX EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

1.

### edX Service Overview.

1.1

edX is a mission-driven online course provider. Through the Service, you may:

* browse courses (“Courses”), programs comprising a series of related courses (“Programs”), and other content (collectively with Courses and Programs, “Offerings”) offered by edX, our Members (as defined below), 2U, Inc. (the parent company of edX) and 2U, Inc.’s subsidiaries (together with 2U, Inc., “2U”), 2U’s partners, and other, non-Member institutions;
* create an Account;
* sign up to receive more information about certain Offerings offered through the Service;
* purchase (or otherwise enroll in and have access to) certain of the Offerings offered through the Service, including a recurring subscription to certain Offerings; and
* participate in certain of the Offerings offered through the Service, including engaging with course content, taking tests, obtaining your results and certificates of achievement, and providing feedback following an Offering.

1.2

“Members” means the educational institutions or other entities that create Offerings using tools provided by edX and offer those Offerings directly to you through the Service. If you are enrolled in the paid or verified track of a Course offered through the Service (the “Certificate Track”), your satisfactory completion of such Course, as determined in our or a Member’s sole discretion, may result in you being awarded a verified certificate of achievement (a “Certificate”) confirming your successful completion of the Course. If you earn a Certificate for each Course in a Program offered through the Service, you will be eligible to receive a Certificate for the Program as well. Unless otherwise determined by edX, no Certificates are awarded for learners enrolled in the unpaid track (“Audit Track”) of a Course.

1.3

Other Offerings are viewable on the edX Site but are provided by educational, corporate, or non-profit partners that are not Members and/or are offered in partnership with 2U. Signing up to receive more information about, enrolling in, or participating in such Offerings may take place on third-party sites (or, in some cases, sites operated by 2U) that are not subject to these Terms.

2.

### Eligibility.

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service complies with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.

3.

### Accounts and Registration.

To access most features of the Service, you must register for an Account. When you register for an Account, you will be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, date of birth, country or region of residence, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to create a username and password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and password, which includes not sharing your password or letting anyone else access or compromise your Account and restricting access to the Service from your compatible mobile device(s) and computer(s). You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account. If you believe that your Account is no longer secure, then you should immediately notify us at info@edx.org.

4.

### Degree Offerings.

4.1

You may elect to enroll in degree or other credit-bearing programs offered by our Members through the Service (collectively, “Degree Offerings”). Members, and not edX, are the providers of the distance education within these Degree Offerings and make all decisions regarding admissions, academic/curriculum content, student instruction, degree conferrals, financial aid, and refunds. When you enroll in any Degree Offering, you may be subject to Member policies and practices (whether set forth in a student handbook or otherwise), required to abide by such policies and practices, and subject to disciplinary action for your failure to do so. These Terms do not limit any terms, conditions, policies, and/or practices established by the Member offering any Degree Offering, and any conflict between these Terms and the terms, conditions, policies, and/or practices specific to the Degree Offering of any Member shall be resolved strictly in favor of such terms, conditions, policies, and/or practices. Nothing in these Terms is intended or shall be deemed to supersede any Member’s terms, conditions, policies, and/or practices applicable to you for any Degree Offering.

4.2

Depending on the Degree Offering, tuition and fee payments for a Degree Offering may be collected by edX or by the applicable Member. You are encouraged to conduct your own research and determine whether the cost of any Degree Offering is right for you based on your career, personal, financial, and other goals. Members typically control the costs (e.g., tuition and fees) associated with their Degree Offerings and those costs may be subject to change for future academic terms or other relevant time periods. Refunds may be available for paid Services as described in our [Refund Policy](#refund-policy) below or as described in any terms and conditions made available by a Member with respect to a particular Degree Offering.

4.3

Professional licensure and certification requirements may vary by state and country, and job requirements vary by employer. edX does not guarantee licensure, certification, or qualification for any profession or job based on your completion of a Degree Offering through the Service. You are advised to research, understand, and comply with the requirements in the applicable state and/or country in which you work or intend to work, and to investigate whether the Degree Offering in which you intend to enroll meets your academic and/or professional needs before enrolling. You should also consult any materials made available by the Member about its Degree Offering(s) with respect to licensure or certification for a particular field or occupation.

5.

### General Payment Terms.

Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. You are responsible for paying all fees charged by or for edX and applicable taxes in a timely manner with a payment mechanism associated with the applicable product or service. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged and, as applicable, any other terms and conditions associated with your purchase (e.g., expiration dates for course entitlements). Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as provided in our [Refund Policy](#refund-policy) or as required by law.

5.1

Price. edX reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. edX will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. edX may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if edX gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. edX, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing available to any of edX’s business partners or customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to you, and we reserve the right to revoke a promotional offer in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Unless otherwise indicated, the fees charged by edX or any of its third-party payment processors for the Service are inclusive of all value added taxes, goods and services taxes, duties, levies, or charges, as determined and applicable based on the tax laws in your country.

5.2

Authorization. You authorize edX to charge all sums for any purchases you make within the Service as described in these Terms or otherwise published by edX, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your Account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then edX may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.

5.3

Subscription Offerings.

1. This Section 5.3 sets forth additional terms that apply to your use of our Subscription Offerings (as defined below). By subscribing to a Subscription Offering, you agree to the additional terms in this Section. For clarity, to the extent you have access to any subscription-based plan through an edX for Business arrangement, such access is not subject to this Section and is instead governed by the agreement between edX and the subscribing organization.
    
2. The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, which enable subscribers to enroll in the Certificate Track of the Offerings included within such plan (each, a “Subscription Offering”). edX may offer some Subscription Offerings with a one-time free trial period. For each Subscription Offering, the duration of any free trial period, the duration of the subscription period, and the fee for the Subscription Offering (the “Subscription Fee”) will be specified at the time you subscribe.
    
3. Your paid subscription to a Subscription Offering (i) will begin on the date when you first purchase your subscription (for clarity, automatically after any applicable free trial period) (the “Subscription Billing Date”) and continue for the duration of the subscription period (such period, the “Initial Subscription Period”), and (ii) will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “Subscription Period”), unless you cancel your subscription or we terminate your subscription or the Subscription Offering.
    
4. If you subscribe to a Subscription Offering, then you authorize edX or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until your cancellation or our termination of your subscription or the Subscription Offering, all sums that have accrued on or before the payment due date. For each Subscription Offering to which you are subscribed, your Account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your subscription for all applicable Subscription Fees for the next Subscription Period. edX or its third-party payment processor will bill such charges to the payment method associated with your Account or that you otherwise provide to us. You will promptly update your Account information with any changes to your payment method (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.
    
5. You may cancel a subscription to a Subscription Offering by selecting “Orders and subscriptions” and then “Manage my subscription” within your Account settings, which will redirect you to edX’s payment processor for Subscription Offerings, where you can click “Cancel plan” for the applicable subscription. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID THE CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD. FOR SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS WITH A FREE TRIAL PERIOD, YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD IN ORDER TO AVOID THE INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION FEE. For more info on canceling a subscription, visit the [edX Help Center](https://support.edx.org/hc).
    
6. If you cancel a subscription to a Subscription Offering before the end of the applicable free trial, you will have access to Certificate Track of the Offerings within the Subscription Offering until the end of the free trial period. After that point, edX reserves the right to (i) unenroll you from all applicable Offering(s) within such Subscription Offering, which may result in you losing any progress you made in such Offering(s) to the extent you opt to re-enroll in the Offering via a new subscription or otherwise or (ii) change your enrollment in such Offering(s) from the Certificate Track to the Audit Track. If you cancel your subscription to a Subscription Offering after any applicable free trial, you will have access to Certificate Track of the Offerings within the Subscription Offering until the end of the then-current Subscription Period. After that point, edX reserves the right to change your enrollment in such Offering(s) from the Certificate Track to the Audit Track.
    

5.4

Delinquent Accounts.

1. edX may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any Account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent Account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees.
    
2. If your payment method is not valid at the time a Subscription Fee is due and you do not resolve the issues with payment during any applicable grace period that may be provided by edX, then edX reserves the right to suspend your subscription to the applicable Subscription Offering(s) and (i) unenroll you entirely from all applicable Offering(s) within such Subscription Offering, which may result in you losing any progress you made in such Offering(s), to the extent you opt to re-enroll in the Offering via subscription or otherwise or (ii) change your enrollment in such Offering(s) from the Certificate Track to the Audit Track.
    

6.

### Licenses.

### Third-Party Terms.

8.1

Third-Party Services and Linked Websites.

1. edX may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information, including User Content (as defined in Section 9.1 (User Content)), to third-party services, including through our implementation of third-party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons) from third-party services, such as Twitter or Facebook. By using one of these tools, you hereby authorize edX to transfer that information to the applicable third-party service. The Service may also contain links to third-party websites.
    
2. Third-party services and linked third-party websites are not under the control of edX, 2U, or any edX Participant (as defined in Section 14.4 (Modification of the Service)), and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of edX, 2U, and any edX Participant are responsible for any third-party service’s use of your exported information or any third-party website’s content. edX, 2U, and the edX Participants are not responsible for and do not routinely screen, approve, review, or endorse the contents of or use of any of the products or services that may be offered by such third parties. Please be sure to review the terms of use and privacy policy of any third-party services and websites before you share any User Content or information with such third-party services or websites. Once sharing occurs, none of edX, 2U, and any edX Participant will have any control over the information that has been shared. If you decide to access any third-party services or linked third-party websites, you do so at your own risk.
    

8.2

Third-Party Software. The Service may include or incorporate third-party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components (“Third-Party Components”). Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining Third-Party Components under the applicable third-party licenses or to limit your use of Third-Party Components under those third-party licenses.

9.

### User Content.

9.1

User Content Generally. Certain features of the Service may permit users to submit, upload, publish, broadcast, or otherwise transmit (“Post”) content to the Service, including messages, reviews, photos, video, or audio (including sound or voice recordings and musical recordings embodied in the video or audio), images, folders, data, text, and any other works of authorship or other works (“User Content”). You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you Post to the Service, subject to the licenses granted in these Terms.

9.2

Limited License Grant to edX and Members. By Posting User Content to or via the Service, you grant edX and, with respect to each Offering, the relevant Member(s), a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed. All of the rights you grant in these Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of external services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or otherwise used on external services via the Service. You agree to pay all monies owing to any person or entity resulting from Posting your User Content and from edX’s exercise of the license set forth in this Section 9.2 (Limited License Grant to edX and Members).

9.3

Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists. If you are a composer or author of a musical work and have granted non-exclusive rights to a Performing Rights Organization (“PRO”), then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through these Terms to edX. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher or a PRO, then you must obtain the consent of that music publisher or PRO to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms or have that music publisher or PRO enter into these Terms with edX. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant edX the licenses in these Terms to such work(s). If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with any contractual obligations you have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Service that may be claimed by your label. Finally, if you wish to perform a cover song and Post it to the Service, you are responsible for securing all rights in and to the underlying musical work before Posting your recording or performance of that musical work to the Service.

9.4

You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post; User Content Representations and Warranties. You must not Post User Content if you are not the owner of or are not fully authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of that User Content. edX disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Service. By providing User Content via the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant to us that:

1. you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize edX and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by edX, the Service, and these Terms;
    
2. your User Content, and the Posting or other use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, misappropriate, or otherwise breach any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property, contract, or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause edX to violate any law or regulation or require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and
    
3. your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.
    

9.5

User Content Disclaimer. We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users Post and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. edX may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms, is alleged to violate the rights of third parties, or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that, when using the Service, you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and you acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against edX with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, edX does not permit infringing activities on the Service.

9.6

Monitoring Content. edX does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that edX reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Service for operational and other purposes. If at any time edX chooses to monitor the content, then edX still assumes no responsibility or liability for content or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of content. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with the Privacy Policy. edX may block, filter, mute, remove or disable access to any User Content uploaded to or transmitted through the Service without any liability to the user who Posted such User Content to the Service or to any other users of the Service.

If you submit a Counter Notification to edX in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then edX will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that edX will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and edX will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless edX’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on edX’s system or network.

12.7

False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “\[a\]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)\] (a) that material or activity is infringing, or (b) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of edX relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” edX reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

14.4

Modification of the Service. edX and the edX Participants (as defined below) reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or any portion of the Service at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Service), temporarily or permanently, without notice to you. edX will have no liability for any change to the Service, including any paid-for functionalities of the Service, or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Service.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Service, and you will defend and indemnify edX, its affiliates, the edX Participants and their respective shareholders, directors, managers, members, officers, employees, consultants, and agents (together, the “edX Entities”) from and against every claim brought by a third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or connected with: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Service; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.

16.

### Disclaimers; No Warranties by edX.

16.1

THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. EDX, 2U, THE EDX PARTICIPANTS, AND THE OTHER ENTITIES PROVIDING OFFERINGS VIEWABLE ON THE EDX SITE BUT NOT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE (THE “OTHER PROVIDERS”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. EDX, 2U, THE EDX PARTICIPANTS, AND THE OTHER PROVIDERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND EDX, 2U, THE EDX PARTICIPANTS, AND THE OTHER PROVIDERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. COURSE CONTENT MAY CHANGE AND COURSES MAY NOT REMAIN AVAILABLE.

16.2

No Other Enrollment. Except as described in Section 4 (Degree Offerings) above, nothing in these Terms or otherwise with respect to your participation in any Offering from a Member through the Service results in you being: (a) an applicant for admission to, or enrolled in, any degree or other credit- or credential-bearing program of such Member; and (b) entitled to use any of the resources of such Member beyond the Offerings provided via the Service or eligible to receive student privileges or benefits provided to students enrolled in degree or other credit- or credential-bearing programs of the Member.

16.3

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE, EDX ENTITIES, OR OTHER PROVIDERS OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE EDX ENTITIES, OTHER PROVIDERS, OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICE (AND ANY PORTION(S) THEREOF) AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

16.4

THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 16 (DISCLAIMERS; NO WARRANTIES BY EDX) APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. edX does not disclaim any warranty or other right that edX is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

17.

### Limitation of Liability.

17.1

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE EDX ENTITIES OR OTHER PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY EDX ENTITY OR ANY OTHER PROVIDER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

17.2

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 18.5 (COMMENCING ARBITRATION) AND 18.7 (ARBITRATION RELIEF) AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE EDX ENTITIES AND THE OTHER PROVIDERS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO EDX FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM AND (B) US $100.

17.3

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

18.

### Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.

18.1

Generally. Except as described in Section 18.2 (Exceptions) and 18.3 (Opt-Out), you and edX agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EDX ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

18.2

Exceptions. Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between you and us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

18.3

Opt-Out. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to edX LLC, Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 7900 Harkins Road, Lanham, MD 20706 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once edX receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 19.2 (Governing Law). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

18.4

Arbitrator. This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between you and us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting edX.

18.5

Commencing Arbitration. Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). edX’s address for Notice is: edX LLC, Attention: edX Legal Department, 7900 Harkins Road, Lanham, MD 20706. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name and email address of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or edX may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, edX will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US $10,000 or if your claim is considered part of a multiple consumer case filing as determined by the AAA, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to the AAA.

18.6

Arbitration Proceedings. Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US $10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or edX must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.

18.7

Arbitration Relief. Except as provided in Section 18.8 (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by edX before an arbitrator was selected, edX will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US $10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (i) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (ii) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

18.8

No Class Actions. YOU AND EDX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and edX agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

18.9

Modification to this Arbitration Provision. If edX makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to edX’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your Account will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will survive.

18.10

Enforceability. If Section 18.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if edX receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19.2 (Governing Law) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

18.11

Consumer Protection. You may have rights under applicable consumer protection laws that cannot be excluded, restricted, or modified by these Terms. Nothing in these Terms is intended to supersede your statutory rights as a consumer.

19.

### Miscellaneous.

19.1

We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your User Content, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

19.2

Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Maryland without regard to conflict of law principles.

Refund Policy
-------------

**Last Updated: June 26, 2023**

Purchases through the Service may be eligible for a refund for a period of time. The general refund policies for some Offering types are described below; provided, however, that certain Offerings may have different refund policies that apply (e.g., no refunds permitted), which will be presented to you at the point of purchase. Refunds will be credited to the payment account used for the purchase and may take up to two billing cycles to process. For clarity, to the extent you have access to any Offering through an edX for Business arrangement whereby payment for the Offering is made on your behalf through the entity sponsoring your access, such access is not subject to this Refund Policy and is instead governed by the agreement between edX and the purchasing organization.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary below, please note that we have no obligation to offer you a refund after you earn a Certificate for an Offering or if you complete a Course but are unsatisfied with your final grade, in each case, regardless of whether your refund request was received during the applicable refund period. Please also be aware that we treat violations of our Terms of Service and [Honor Code](#honor-code) very seriously, and we reserve the right to refuse your refund request if we terminate your access to the Service (or any portion(s) thereof) for violation of our Terms or any of our policies, even if your request is made in accordance with the applicable refund policy for the Offering.

If the applicable refund period for a purchase has passed or refunds are otherwise not available for an Offering and you believe a refund is warranted (e.g., as required under local law), please submit a support ticket via the [Contact us](https://courses.edx.org/support/contact_us) form.

For more information about our refund process, please visit the [edX Help Center](https://support.edx.org/hc).

### 1\. One-time Purchases

* Certificate Track: With respect to your enrollment in the Certificate Track of any Course offered with the option to enroll in either the Certificate Track or the Audit Track, refunds are available for a period of 14 days after your payment or 14 days after the Course starts, whichever occurs later; provided, however, that no refunds are available more than 6 months after your payment. During such refund period, the refund process will be initiated automatically when you withdraw from the Course or unenroll from the Certificate Track by clicking on the unenroll link on the learner dashboard.
    
* Program Bundles: With respect to your purchase of a Program bundle (i.e., a one-time, upfront purchase of enrollment entitlements that enable you to enroll in the Certificate Track of all Courses within a Program):
    
    * refunds for unused entitlements are available for a period of 6 months after your payment; and
    * refunds for used entitlements (i.e., you use an entitlement to enroll in a Course) are available for a period of 14 days after your enrollment or 14 days after the Course starts, whichever occurs later; provided, however, that no refunds are available more than 6 months after your payment.
    
    Please email billing@edx.org to request a refund. For more information about Program bundles, please visit the [edX Help Center](https://support.edx.org/hc).
    
* Professional Education Courses: With respect to your enrollment in a Professional Education course (i.e., a Course offered on the edX Site without an Audit Track), refunds are available for a period of 2 days after your payment or 2 days after the course starts, whichever occurs later; provided, however, that no refunds are available more than 6 months after your payment. Please email billing@edx.org to request a refund.

For more information about refund options for one-time purchases (for example, changing to another course session), please visit the [edX Help Center](https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us).

### 2\. Month-to-Month Subscription Offerings

### 3\. Degree Offerings
