Whenever we collect Personal Data from you, we may do so on the following legal bases:

1\. Your consent to such collection and use;

2\. Out of necessity for the performance of an agreement between us and you, such as your

agreement to use our Services and products;

3\. Our legitimate business interest, including but not limited to the following circumstances where

collecting or using Personal Data is necessary:



●



● Intra-company transfers of customer data for administrative purposes;

● Product development and enhancement, where the processing enables us to

enhance, modify, personalize, or otherwise improve our Services and

communications for the benefit of our customers, and to better understand how

people interact with our Sites and Services;

● Fraud detection and prevention;

● Enhancement of our cybersecurity, including improving the security of our network

and information systems; and

● General business operations and diligence;



provided that, in each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose

against your privacy and confidentiality interests, including taking into account your reasonable

expectations, the impact of processing, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place to

protect your privacy. In all circumstances, we will limit such processing for our legitimate business

interest to what is necessary for its purposes.



Information We Share



We do not share Personal Data collected through the Sites or Services with companies,

organizations and individuals outside of Rave Mobile Safety unless one of the following

circumstances applies:



1. With your consent. We may share Personal Data with companies, organizations, or individuals

outside of Rave Mobile Safety when we have your consent to do so.



2. Enterprise accounts. Your employer or school may have offered you access to our Services. In

such a circumstance, we may share Personal Data you provide with your employer or school so that

it can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.



3. For external processing. We may provide Personal Data to our affiliates or other trusted

businesses or partners to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this

Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These third parties,

including, without limitation, , 9-1-1 or equivalent services, fire, police, emergency medical,

emergency management, campus safety officials, public health services, services providing

safety-related monitoring and response (collectively, “Emergency Service Providers”) and

communication service providers. Examples of permitted disclosure of Personal Data include:



1. Your wireless phone number may be submitted to participating Emergency Service

Providers, in order to locate the device during an emergency or transmit messages

that you send or receive. We may store or archive snapshots of then-current

Subscriber information as it’s made available to Emergency Service Providers, for

the period of time dictated by their record keeping policies. Such third parties may

use such information to send emergency and general interest notifications to you via

various communication methods (e.g. voice calls, text messaging, email, etc.).

2. In the event an emergency call or other direct communication is placed from your

phone or device, and provided that the Emergency Service Provider receiving the

call uses our Services, your information may be displayed on the answering

operator's workstation screen or made available to emergency responders.

3. In the event a non-9-1-1 call is made to an Emergency Service Provider from your

phone and is then routed into a 9-1-1 system, if the receiving 9-1-1 agency uses our

Services your information may be displayed on the 9-1-1 operator's workstation

screen. In these situations, once information is passed to the local 9-1-1 authorities,

we no longer have control over the transmission of the information. It may be

conveyed verbally over an unsecured radio or transmitted in some other way to the

responding emergency response team or others.

4. In the event an Emergency Service Provider uses the Services’ database query

tools, and your information includes an address within the querying provider's

jurisdiction, and a portion of your information matches the provider's query criteria,

and if you have elected to participate in this portion of our Services, your information

will be displayed in the search results presented to that provider.

It is our policy to only share Personal Data with contractors, service providers and other third parties

who are bound by obligations to keep Personal Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for

which we disclose it to them. Under certain circumstances, you may avoid having us share your

information with our business partners and vendors by not granting us permission to share it. Not

granting us permission to share your information with our business partners or vendors may limit

your access to their services through the Sites. We do not share Personal Data with third parties for

their own marketing purposes.



4. For Legal Reasons. We may share Personal Data with companies, organizations or individuals

outside of Rave Mobile Safety if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or

disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:



1. Comply with an applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable

governmental request.

2. Enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations.

3. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.

4. Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Rave Mobile Safety, our

users or the public, as required or permitted by law.



We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their Personal Data when appropriate in our

judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may

dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or

lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.



The specific circumstances under which we may share your Personal Data will vary based on the

information you provide, the Services you elect to participate in, and how you use the Services.



5. Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, sell, or share assets

in connection with, for example, a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy.

In such transactions, Personal Data about our users is often a transferred business asset. In the

event that Rave Mobile Safety itself or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Personal Data

about our users may be one of the transferred assets to enable the new owner to provide the

Services to you in compliance with our agreements, this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

Subsequent to the change of ownership, the new owner will be solely responsible for compliance

with this Privacy Policy (or a replacement to which you agree) and the law.



6. Aggregate Site Use Information. Our Services may automatically collect usage information,

such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Sites and users who use our Services. We use

this information in aggregate form and not in a manner that would identify you personally. We may

share aggregate and anonymized/ pseudonymized Personal Data to advertisers and other third

parties in order to promote or describe use of the Sites and Services.



Rave Mobile Safety is not responsible for the actions or inactions of any third party receiving your

Personal Data as permitted herein. These third parties may have their own respective privacy

policies governing their use, protection and disclosure of your Personal Data.



Consequences of Your Failure to Provide Personal Data

Your provision of Personal Data is required in order to use certain parts of our Sites and Services. If

you fail to provide such Personal Data, you may not be able to access and use our Services on our

Sites or parts of our Services available via the Sites.



Our Retention of Your Personal Data



We may retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose for

collection. We keep your Personal Data for no longer than reasonably necessary for your use of our

products and Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward to conform to legal and

business requirements.



If your account is removed from our Sites and Services, we generally delete account information

within thirty (30) days of account removal, except that we retain your Personal Data even after you

have closed your account if reasonably necessary to address our legitimate business interests,

including to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory

requirements, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain security,

prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms of Service, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from

further messages from us.



Your Choices regarding Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your

Personal Data



Whenever you use our Services, we aim to provide you with choices about how we use your

wrong, we will give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that

information for legitimate business or legal purposes. Subject to applicable law, you may obtain a

that information through your Profile or Account, or by contacting us

provided with your consent by your school or employer, you agree that we may contact you in the

event of a change in this Privacy Policy, to provide you with any Services-related notices, or to

Third Party Links



The Sites may contain links to webpages operated by parties other than Rave Mobile Safety. We do

not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other

practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement

of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the user

to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the user selects or software the user downloads

from such websites is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of

a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the

user will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website. Rave Mobile Safety strongly

recommends that each user review the third party's terms and policies.



International Transfer



We are committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations and mandatory government

standards regarding the protection of Personal Data.



Since we are a global organization, Personal Data and any additional information submitted may be

used globally in connection with employment, business processes within Rave Mobile Safety, or

communicating with our clients. Therefore, Personal Data may be transferred to other Rave Mobile

Safety entities worldwide, where it will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and laws

that are applicable in each country. Countries where we process data may have laws which are

different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.



If we transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will implement suitable safeguards and

rely on legally provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders to ensure that your

Personal Data is protected.



How We Protect Personal Data



Rave Mobile Safety maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect

the user's Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction,

loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational

measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological

reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and

likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, we use

commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and transport layer

security (TLS) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data. However,

Rave Mobile Safety cannot guarantee the security of user account or other personal information.

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, could compromise the

security of user information at any time.

Children



In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we do not market to or

knowingly collect any information about children under the age of 13 unless and until a relevant

institution has provided consent and authorization for a child under the age of 13 to use the Sites or

Services and for us to collect information from such child. If you are a minor less than 13 years old,

please do not register for Services or provide any personal information about you to us. If you are

less than 16 years old, do not provide any personal health information about yourself to us. If you

believe that we might have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under age 13 or

personal health information from a child under age 16 without proper consent, please contact us

at privacy@ravemobilesafety.com. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal

information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, without proper

consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.



Direct Marketing and “Do Not Track” Signals



Rave Mobile Safety does not track its customers over time or across third party websites to provide

targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some

third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which

enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may

include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to

opt out of data collection through those technologies.



Rights of California Residents



California residents are entitled under the California Consumer Privacy Act to contact us for various

purposes, including to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to

third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information to third

parties for their direct marketing purposes. California residents have the right to be informed as to

what personal information about them we may have, how we collected and may use that information

and how to have it corrected or deleted and may request further information about our compliance

with this law by contacting us by one of the means listed in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
