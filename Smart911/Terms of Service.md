ACCESS TO THE SERVICES AND THAT THE SERVICES MAY NOT BE UTILIZED BY

EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT DO HAVE ACCESS. Rave cannot control the manner

purpose of receiving messages from a specific User, Subscribers who are entered into the Service

by use of a commercially available database, as well as those Subscribers who are entered into any

Service by a User. Subscribers understand and agree that their registration into any of the Services

shall connect the Subscriber with a specific User, or a specific User list, such that the Subscriber will

receive messages from that User or when the User sends messages to such list. Subscribers

consent to be contacted through SMS, email, or voice call via an automated dialer using a

pre-recorded message, by Rave and any User. All Users acknowledge and agree that, by

owns such contact information has expressly authorized the User to enter such information

into the Notification Services to receive pre-recorded messages from the User via an

automated dialer, SMS or email.



Subscriber understands and agrees that by creating a Subscriber Account, you will periodically

receive text messages. The frequency of these messages will depend on how you use this service,

and how frequently Emergency Service Providers or Users send messages through this service.

Message and data rates may apply.

STOP to number from which you are receiving messages (e.g. 22911, 67283, and/or 226787), after

which time you will no longer receive text messages from the Services. Text INFO or HELP to 22911,

67283, or 226787 from your registered mobile phone and you will be sent a text message with
