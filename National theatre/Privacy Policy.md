We use your personal information where have a legitimate interest to get in touch to notify you if you are a prize winner. If you win a prize, we may ask you to provide additional information (such as your bank account details or postal address) in order to transfer the prize to you.

We will make available information to demonstrate that a valid award took place (on the basis of our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of other prize draw entrants and members of the public).

If you wish to object to this information being published or made available, or if you wish to reduce the amount of information that we make available, please contact datarequest@nationaltheatre.org.uk.

Please note that we will always make prize winner information available to the Advertising Standards Agency, if challenged.

**To conduct research** (on the basis of our legitimate interests to improve our products, services and customer service). We will use your personal information to:

* classify our audiences into groups or segments, using information from bookings and digital interactions, and publicly available information. We do this to better understand our audience and tailor messaging accordingly;
* measure and understand how our audiences respond to a variety of marketing activity so we can ensure our activity is well targeted, relevant and effective;
* undertake audience research via an online or telephone survey or in person. Participation in these is entirely voluntary, so you can choose whether or not to disclose any information requested. We will make it clear whether your response to surveys is anonymous or not and, should you provide any further information, the National Theatre will inform you how it will be used;
* analyse and continually improve the services we offer, including our artistic programme, our websites and our other products;
* help us run the test versions of our websites that we use internally to pilot new features and ensure the smooth running of our web services; and
* help diagnose and manage our websites, to audit the geographical make-up of users, and to establish how they have arrived at our websites.

**To ensure safety and security of our premises and protect our business interests.** In certain circumstances, we use your information to ensure the safety and security of our services, buildings, and people, including to protect against, investigate and deter fraud, incidents or accidents related to our premises or business, unauthorised or illegal activities, systems testing, maintenance and development (on the basis of our legitimate interests to operate a safe and lawful business or where we have a legal obligation to do so).

**To comply with our legal obligations.** In certain circumstances, we will need to use your information to comply with our legal obligations, for example to comply with any court orders or subpoenas, carry out due diligence in accordance with statutory regulations or keep our database accurate and relevant, for example, using National Change of Address (on the basis of our complying with a legal obligation).

**To identify individuals for memberships and philanthropic support** (on the basis of our legitimate interests to seek support, promote fundraising or legacy campaigns by post to a select number of our supporters, and issue invitations to some of our fundraising events). We explain this further below.

We are a registered charity (no. 224223) and rely heavily on voluntary contributions from our audience and other funders for our work at the South Bank and in schools and communities throughout the country. Based on the frequency of visits and purchasing patterns, we may promote our memberships to you or ask you for additional support for our work.

If you live in the USA and are an actual or prospective donor we may transfer your information to the American Associates of the National Theatre (AANT), a New York-based organisation which raises money to support the work of the National Theatre. We may also transfer your data if you are attending an event organised by AANT.

For a small number of people, we may use basic research tools to estimate potential interest in other membership levels or in supporting us further. This helps us understand the background of the people who may choose to support us and helps us to make appropriate requests for gifts to those who may be able and willing to give. This research may include information we hold (for example, payment methods and postcodes) and publicly-available information.

In some cases, we may carry out initial research on potential higher-level donors prior to requesting consent on the basis of our legitimate interests to seek potential supporters. This information will also help us to meet our obligations to protect the charity from financial fraud and risk.

In addition to general use of the internet for research we make use of company, director and shareholder information from publicly available, officially registered information providers, such as the organisations in the table below.

Legitimate interests
--------------------

We may also use your information to further the legitimate interests of others, such as other partner organisations we work with or the general public.

Where we rely on legitimate interests to use your information for our legitimate interests, we make sure that we take into account any potential impact that such use may have on you. Our legitimate interests don’t automatically override yours and we won’t use your information if we believe your interests should override ours unless we have other grounds to do so (such as your consent or a legal obligation). If you have any concerns about our processing, please refer to the **‘How can you manage your personal information?’** section below.

Where do we keep your information?
----------------------------------

We’re committed to protecting your personal information. We adopt robust and appropriate technologies and policies to protect it from unauthorised access and improper use. In addition, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it as it would have in the EEA.

As part of the services offered to you, the personal information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the EEA. By way of example, this may happen if any of the computer servers used to host our websites are located in a country outside of the EEA. If the National Theatre transfers your personal information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we comply with data protection law. Unless a statutory exception applies, we use specific safeguards  which give your personal information the same protection it has in the UK.

In particular, if you live in the USA and we transfer your information to the American Associates of the National Theatre (AANT), we use the Standard Contractual Clauses approved for use in the UK to protect your information.

How long do we keep your information for?
-----------------------------------------

We will keep your information only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and to fulfil our legal obligations. We will not keep more information than we need.

The retention period will vary according to the purpose, for example if purchasing a ticket only, we will typically keep your data for up to eight years from the date of your last transaction whereas, if you have pledged a legacy to the National Theatre, we will hold your details until notified by your executors. For further information about how long we will keep your information, please contact our Privacy Team using the contact details set out in the **‘About us’** section above.

Is your information shared with any third parties?
--------------------------------------------------

The National Theatre will never share, sell, rent or trade your personal information with or to any third parties for marketing purposes without your prior consent. We will ask for your consent to share personal information with arts organisations who have collaborated with us on shows you have seen.

Some of our service providers may have access to your data in order to perform services on our behalf. This could include:

* a payment process provider;
* our telephone ticket sales service provider;
* a third party venue where you are attending a performance that is not taking place at our premises so that you can receive any specific venue information you need before you attend the performance;
* our catering providers; or
* where we require a third party to advise us (such as legal advisors).

We may disclose personal information to appropriate third parties to assist in anti-fraud checks and investigations. We may also share limited personal information with the NHS Test and Trace as set out in ‘**Why do we collect this information, and what do we do with it?**’ section above.

Every email we send to you will include details on how to change your communications preferences or unsubscribe from future communications.

You can [opt-out of targeted advertising here](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/privacy/digital-targeting-opt-out). Please remember that you may still see the same number of adverts, but they will be adverts that appear as standard and less relevant to you.

**What we need from you to process your requests**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for our own record-keeping and research purposes. We may also need to send you service-related communications relating to your website user accounts even when you have requested not to receive marketing communications.
