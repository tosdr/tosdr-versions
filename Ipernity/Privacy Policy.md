* Unless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to ipernity, ipernity receives and stores EXIF data for all photos or videos. By default, ipernity displays the EXIF data about photos or video you upload.
* When you upload a photo or video with geographical data (i.e. from a mobile device) or manually geo-tag your photo or video, the photo or video’s location can be shown on a map.
