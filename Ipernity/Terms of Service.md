Parents who wish to allow their children access to the Website should assist them in setting up any relevant accounts and supervise their access to the Website. By allowing your child access to the Website, they will be able to access all of the features including, internal email, message boards, instant messages and chat (among others).

You consent that this Content is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties, which you are held to comply with.  

* Your rights

5.7 Ipernity does not claim ownership of Content you submit, post or display or make available on or through the Website. You or a third-party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark, and copyright to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Website and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate.  

5.8 The Content declared private and submitted to the Website might be seen fortuitously from the public, in case of user misuse of the features, pirating, hacking or computer related errors.

5.9 By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Website, you grant ipernity a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce, adapt, distribute and publish such Content through the Website, including through RSS or any other Content feeds offered by the Website.

Any breach of a rule or complaint from any eligible party will irrevocably result in removing or disabling access to the material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity.

This arrangement goes without saying within the general pattern of protecting intellectual property, copyright and works.
