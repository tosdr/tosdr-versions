Welcome To The HP Website
=========================

Welcome to the HP Inc. (“HP” or “Our” or “We” or “Us”) website – and thank You for visiting, We hope You enjoy the experience!

These Terms of Use (“These Terms”) are a legal contract between You and HP (collectively, “Everyone”) and govern Your use of this website, as well as other websites that HP may control, and all the text, data, information, software, graphics, photographs, and more (all of which We refer to as “Materials”) that HP and its Subsidiaries may make available to You, as well as any services We may provide through any of Our websites (all of which are referred to in These Terms as “This Website”).

You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information for so long as You use This Website. Because it is Your account, it is Your responsibility to obtain and maintain all equipment, services and software needed for access to and use of This Website as well as paying related charges. It is also Your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of Your password(s). Should You believe Your password or other security information for This Website has been breached in any way, You must immediately notify Us.

Sometimes, We collect certain personal information about You solely in connection with Your access and use of This Website. HP's use of that information is governed by the provisions of the [HP Online Privacy Statement](http://www.hp.com/us/en/privacy/privacy.html).

We reserve the right to require that You change Your password or restrict Your access to This Website as We deem reasonably necessary.

Unauthorized Use of This Website, Acceptable Use Policy
-------------------------------------------------------

We authorize Your limited use of This Website. Any other use of This Website beyond the Permitted Uses is prohibited and, therefore, constitutes unauthorized use of This Website. This is because all rights in This Website remain the property of HP.

Unauthorized use of This Website may result in violation of various United States and international copyright laws.

THIS MEANS THAT HP DOES NOT PROMISE YOU THAT THE WEBSITE IS FREE OF PROBLEMS. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, HP makes no warranty that This Website will meet your requirements or that This Website will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free or that defects in This Website will be corrected. HP makes no warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of This Website or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through This Website. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you through This Website or from HP, its subsidiaries, or other affiliated companies, or its or their suppliers (or the respective officers, directors, employees, or agents of any such entities) (collectively, "The HP Parties") shall create any warranty. HP disclaims all equitable indemnities.

IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE HP PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR (B) DAMAGES THAT ARE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED UNITED STATES (US$100.00) DOLLARS IN TOTAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE RESULTING FROM LOSS OF REVENUES, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS WEBSITE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE OF THIS WEBSITE), WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND EVEN IF ANY HP PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED (OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN) OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages.

----------------------------------------------

HP may provide products (such as hardware or software), services (such as software subscription services, hardware maintenance or repair or software maintenance, installation, or training) or access via This Website under the terms of a separate agreement between You and HP, such as a license agreement or separate terms of sale and warranty terms (each, an "Other Agreement"). HP's obligations regarding any product, service, or access that it makes available to You under any Other Agreement shall be governed solely by the Other Agreement under which such product, service or access is provided and These Terms shall not be deemed or construed to alter the terms of any such Other Agreement. If there is an inconsistency between These Terms and any Other Agreement, the Other Agreement will control.

For example, the use of any software that is made available to download from the HP Websites ("Software") is governed by the terms of the end user license agreement, if any, that accompanies or is included with the Software ("License Agreement"). You may not install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a License Agreement unless You first have agreed to the License Agreement. If there is no License Agreement, then These Terms will govern Your use of that Software.
