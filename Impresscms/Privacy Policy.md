We value your privacy and strive to protect your personal information. Please read this Policy to understand what types of information we collect from you, for what purposes and what choices you have regarding our collection of your information.

This policy covers the impresscms.org website. By accessing, using or posting information to this Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Service](https://www.impresscms.org/modules/content/content.php?content_id=1177&page=terms-of-service).

### Information We Collect About You

We collect several types of information from and about you, including:

1. Your email address and password. We treat this information as "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII". We never store passwords in plain text format, only secure password hashes.
2. Non-personally identifiable information, such as demographic information about you, information about your computer system or device, your preferences, your online activity, and your location information ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information" a "Non-PII"). Non-PII, by itself, does not identify you, but it can be combined with other information in way that allows you to be identified. If this happens, we will treat the combined information as PII.

We may collect information from or about you in the following ways:

* **Information Provided by You**. We collect information provided by you when you (1) create your public profile; (2) communicate with us or request information about or from us by e-mail or other means; (3) participate in our online forums or post content on this Website ("User Contributions"), (4) fill out forms or fields on this Website; (5) sign-up for any of our newsletters, materials or our services on this Website or other sites; or (6) participate in our online surveys or questionnaires.
* **Automatic Information Collection**. We also use automatic data collection technologies to collect and store certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns when you interact with this Website through your computer or mobile device. In addition, we may allow third party ad networks to use automatic data collection technologies to collect similar information about you for purposes of providing interest-based ads.

### User Contributions

Your public profile that you create on this Website will be visible to all users of this Website. Your User Contributions are posted on this Website and transmitted to others at your own risk. Please see our Terms of Service for more information concerning User Contributions.

### Service providers and partners

We use a number of service providers to help us operate the site and provide high quality user experience to our visitors. Some of those providers can access Non-PII about you via automatic data collection technologies.

* We use [ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/) for spam detection and prevention. When you register an account or complete a form on impresscms.org, you accept the ReCaptcha [terms of service](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) and [privacy policy.](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)
* We use Mailchimp to send Newsletter emails to users who subscribe to receive them. You can review [Mailchimp privacy policy](http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) for information on how they manage user data.

### Automatic Information Collection Technologies

The information that we collect about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns includes, but is not limited to, traffic data, location data, logs, the resources that you access, search queries, as well as information about the computer or device you are using and the Internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type.

This automatically collected information typically does not include PII, but we may maintain it or associate it with your personal information collected in other ways.
