Don’t misuse our Services.  For example, don’t interfere with our Services, try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide, or extensively or automatically copy any content from the Services (in other words, no scraping). You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies, if we are investigating suspected misconduct, or for any other reason.

These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services, including the Active Minds name and logo. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

Our Services display some Content that is not our own.  For example, some Content belongs to our grant-providers, sponsors, advertisers, other third parties, or other users (collectively, “Third Party Content”) or is Your Content (as defined in Section 5 below).  We are not responsible for, and you waive all of our liability with respect to, Third Party Content or Your Content.  Third Party Content and Your Content is the sole responsibility of the individual or entity that makes it available via the Services.

Product information, including descriptions, technical information, specifications, and other information related to a Product (collectively, “Product Information”) are provided for your convenience in your selection of Products. The accuracy or completeness of Product Information is not guaranteed and is subject to change without notice. The appearance of the Products on the Services may differ from the physical article depending on your Internet browser or the device or monitor you use.

If a carrier is not able to successfully deliver the Products it will leave a notice with contact information to arrange a new delivery date.

You may submit, upload, and share videos, pictures, text and other content to or through the Services (“Your Content”), and in doing so you must follow these Terms and the rules and policies referenced in these Terms. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in Your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

When you upload, submit, or otherwise share Your Content to or through our Services, you give us (and those we work with) a royalty-free, worldwide license in perpetuity (subject to any applicable privacy laws) to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that Your Content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute Your Content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services.  Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.  If Your Content is subject to our [Media Release](https://www.activeminds.org/get-involved/share-your-story/media-release/) and there is a conflict between these Terms and the Media Release, the Media Release will control with respect to the matter in conflict.  

We may publicly display your profile information, posts, and actions you take on the Services or on third-party applications connected to your account (such as reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in content promoting us or supporting our mission of mental health awareness and suicide prevention. You may request that we delete any of Your Content that you submit to the Services by sending us an email at info@activeminds.org.  To the extent within our control we’ll remove Your Content from public display and mark it for future deletion if permitted by applicable law; however, it may persist in backup or residual copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to other users through the Services).  For purposes of clarification, once you submit or share Your Content with others via the Services (_e.g._, other users or third parties), we no longer have control over those portions of Your Content and will not be able to delete it or prevent them from using it.    

You agree that you will not use the Services to:

* Submit excessive or unsolicited commercial messages or spam any users;
* Submit malicious content or viruses;
* Solicit other people’s login information, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information;

**7\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION** 

As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others, and require our users and customers to do so.  If you are a copyright owner or its agent and believe that any content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent (the “Designated Agent”) with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C § 512(c)(3) for further detail): 

* Identification of the work or material being infringed.
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including its location, with sufficient detail so that we are capable of finding it and verifying its existence.
* Contact information for the notifying party (the “Notifying Party”), including name, address, telephone number, and email address.
* A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.
* A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.

Please also note that the information provided in a notice of copyright infringement may be forwarded to the user who posted the allegedly infringing content. After removing material in response to a valid DMCA notice, we will notify the user responsible for the allegedly infringing material that we have removed or disabled access to the material. We will terminate, under appropriate circumstances, users who are repeat copyright infringers, and we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate any user for actual or apparent copyright infringement.

If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you may file a counter-notification with us by providing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below:

* The specific URLs of material that we have removed or to which we have disabled access.
* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia**,** and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
* The following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”
* Your signature.

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification. The original Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then have ten (10) days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material.  If we do not receive any such notification within ten (10) days, we may restore the material to the Services.
