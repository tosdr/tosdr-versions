#### 13\. Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A “session cookie” expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A “persistent cookie” stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.

When you visit our Website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our Website and in some cases, your e-mail address. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor’s actions on a web site, such as a visitor’s cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.

#### 14\. Mobile Privacy

#### 16\. Facebook Custom Audience

We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool. We do not share any of your personal information with Facebook. The tool lets Us convert your e-mail address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from e-mail addresses of its users.

#### 17\. Social Media Interactions

We invite you to socialize and share your experience with Us with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram.
