[Wistia - Terms of Service](#wistia-terms-of-service)
=====================================================

The following Terms of Service (“Terms” or “Agreement”) constitute a legal agreement between you or the entity or company that you represent (“Customer” or “You”) and Wistia, Inc. (“Wistia”), which governs Customer’s use of the Services. The Services can be accessed (a) as a free-to-the-user service having the specifications outlined in the respective Plan (the “Free Version”) and (b) as a paid service having the specifications outlined in the respective Plan, for which Customer pays a monthly or yearly subscription fee (the “Paid Version”). Customer’s use of the Services is subject to (a) the terms and conditions set forth below and (b) Wistia’s privacy policy, found at [https://wistia.com/privacy](https://wistia.com/privacy) and incorporated herein by reference, so please take the time to fully understand how these Terms and Wistia’s privacy policy govern Customer’s relationship with Wistia and Customer’s use of the Services. The Services are available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old. If Customer is an individual, Customer represents and warrants that Customer is at least 18 years old. Each business or individual may have only 1 Free Version account.

Customer acknowledges that the Free Version is provided at no charge, and therefore, the terms that govern use of the Free Version are different, in part, from the terms that govern use of the Paid Version. The specific provisions that relate only to the Paid Version are set forth in Sections 6 (Paid Version Payments), 7.1 (Paid Version Limited Warranty), 8.1 (Paid Version Limitation of Liability), and 9.2 (Termination of the Paid Version), and the specific provision that relates only to the Free Version is set forth in Section 8.2 (Free Version Limitation of Liability). All other non-specified terms shall apply to both the Paid Version and Free Version. If Customer upgrades from the Free Version to a Paid Version, Customer acknowledges and agrees that the terms that govern the use of the Paid Version shall automatically apply to Customer upon such upgrade.

CUSTOMER’S RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICES IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED ON ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS. BY CLICKING ON THE “ACCEPT” BUTTON AND/OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON ITS BEHALF. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.

-------------------------------------------------

### [11.1 Third Party Sites.](#11-1-third-party-sites)

The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services (collectively, “Third Party Services,” and each a “Third Party Service”) that are not owned or controlled by Wistia. Wistia encourages You to be aware when You leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that You visit or utilize. You acknowledge that your use of such Third Party Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions and privacy policy of such Third Party Services (including, but not limited to, the YouTube Terms of Service located at [https://www.youtube.com/t/terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms)), that by using the Services You agree to be bound by such terms and conditions and privacy policies, and that Wistia does not endorse, is not liable for, and makes no representations regarding Third Party Services, their content, or the manner in which any such Third Party Service uses, stores, or processes Content and Customer Data. Wistia is not liable for any damage or loss arising from or in connection with your use of or access to Third Party Services and your reliance on the policies, privacy practices, and data security processes of any Third Party Service. Wistia is not responsible or liable for any changes to or deletion of Content or Customer Data by Third Party Services. Certain functions of the Services may depend on the functionality, or the available functionality, of certain Third Party Services. Wistia does not control such functionality, and the functionality of Third Party Services may change without any notice to Wistia. Wistia may stop providing access to certain functions of the Services if Wistia determines, in its sole discretion, that the availability and functionality of Third Party Services warrant such cessation of functions. Wistia will not be liable to You for any refunds or any damage or loss arising from or in connection with (a) any such change of availability or functionality by any Third Party Services, or (b) any resulting change to the Services. You irrevocably waive any claim against Wistia with respect to such Third Party Services.

### [11.2 Entire Agreement.](#11-2-entire-agreement)

This Agreement, together with Wistia’s Privacy Policy and the applicable Plan(s) and any other Wistia documents or policies referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties about the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the Agreement and the Plan, the terms and conditions in the Plan will prevail and be controlling, and the terms and conditions in the Agreement will prevail and be controlling over terms set forth in Customer’s purchase order (or other similar document). Customer’s purchase order is only effective as its unqualified commitment to access and pay for the Services upon the terms (and only the terms) set forth herein. No waiver, consent or, except as expressly provided herein, modification of these Terms shall bind either party unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. If this Agreement is required to be registered with any governmental authority, Customer shall cause such registration to be made and shall bear any expense or tax payable in respect thereof.

### [11.3 Governing Law.](#11-3-governing-law)

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor any enactment of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall apply to this Agreement. The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement will be the state or federal courts located in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such action. In any action or proceeding to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with such action or proceeding and enforcing any judgment or order obtained.

### [11.4 Remedies.](#11-4-remedies)

Except as specifically provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 5, the non-breaching party may suffer irreparable damage for which it may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting any bond.

### [11.5 Notices.](#11-5-notices)

Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9.1 and 10, any notice under this Agreement shall be provided in the following manner: by Wistia to you, on the Wistia website, by email or by another means intended to bring the notice to your attention; by you to Wistia, by email at [support@wistia.com](mailto:support@wistia.com), or at such other address designated by Wistia. All notices shall be in English.

### [11.6 Assignment.](#11-6-assignment)

This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned, in whole or in part, by either party without the other party’s written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). However, without consent, but with notice, either party may assign this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all of its business which concerns this Agreement (whether by sale of assets or equity, merger, consolidation or otherwise). Any attempted transfer in violation hereof will be void and of no effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.

### [11.7 Independent Contractors.](#11-7-independent-contractors)

The parties shall be independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein will constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.

### [11.8 Publicity.](#11-8-publicity)

Neither party will make public announcements or issue press releases relating to this Agreement or the terms hereof without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Customer agrees that Wistia has the right to disclose Customer’s status as a customer of Wistia as needed in the ordinary course of business.

### [11.9 Force Majeure.](#11-9-force-majeure)

Except for the obligation to make payments, neither Party shall be liable for delays or breaches in its performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as acts of vendors, acts of god, acts or omissions of civil or military authority, government priorities, fire, earthquakes, strikes or other labor problems, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, riots, war, acts of terror, computer or telecommunications failures, network intrusions or denial of service attacks and delays of transportation (“Force Majeure Event”).
