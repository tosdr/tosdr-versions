SteamID's Privacy Policy
========================

  
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which SteamID collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the SteamID's website ("Site","SteamID","SteamID API"). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by SteamID.  
  
  

SteamID access to SteamCommunity Data
-------------------------------------

  
SteamID collects information made publicly available by you via the SteamAPI which allows services such as SteamID to collect data. The User that has generated content for said SteamID has agreed its use under the [Steam Subscriber](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#6) agreement. This Privacy policy has been written to conform with the [SteamAPI](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms) policy  
**SteamID does not have access or collect your personal SteamCommunity data**  
  
An example of a steam API call can be viewed [here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/msart?xml=1) Please note this old XML method has been deprecated for some years but provides a basic example of what an API is.  
There is a [Steam Web API Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) if you would like to read more into the current SteamAPI and how to use this yourself and or to learn how SteamID and other websites collects this information from Steam.  
  

What is the non-personal information we collect from Steam used for?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The data that we collect about gaming profiles is used to draw statistics and provide a look up service which aids in spotting scammers, cheaters, purchased accounts, compromised accounts, accounts pretending to be bots for other third party services. It is also used to locate old friends, get copies of your old avatars.  
This service includes but not limited to displaying Friends list , Old friends , Previous avatars, previous gaming personas, level history , CustomURL history, easy viewing of friend bans and much more.  
  

### Further expansion on data collected from the SteamAPI and how we deal with certain fields

  
The real name "realname" field passed though on the SteamAPI **is not** stored in a database or processed with SteamID.  
The Country "loccountrycode" field set on the Steam profile is displayed and is recorded for statistics  
The gaming avatar URL . hash is collected BUT the image itself is not stored on SteamID servers.  
  

Personal identification information (and how this is used)
----------------------------------------------------------

  
Data Source: **user input - SteamID**
