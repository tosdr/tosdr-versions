Terms of Use
============

**Introduction**

This page sets out the terms and conditions (the “Agreement”) for using the FreeSteamKeys.com website (the “Website”). Please be aware that by joining the Website and participating in the community you agree to abide by the Agreement.

**The Website**

FreeSteamKeys.com is community driven and relies on gamers to share Steam related giveaways with each other.

FreeSteamKeys is not associated in any way with Valve Corporation. All names, brands, associated imagery and artwork are trademarks and/or copyrighted materials of their respective owners.

By providing links to other sites, FreeSteamKeys.com does not guarantee, approve or endorse the information or products available at these sites, or does a link indicate any association with or endorsement by the linked site to FreeSteamKeys.com.

In order to cover the costs of running the Website we have relationships with various gaming companies, retailers and advertising companies. These companies may pay us a small commission for the sales we generate. We allow members of the Website to share any acceptable content, regardless of whether or not we earn a commission.

**Member Content**

You acknowledge that all content posted on the Site is the sole responsibility of the person posting such content. This means that you, and not the Site, are entirely responsible for all content that you post, transmit or otherwise make available via the Site. The Management does not guarantee its accuracy, integrity or quality.

We may permit Members to post, upload, publish, submit or transmit Member Content.
