Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.

This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

InterPals.net does not give advertisers access to your individual personal account information. However, by selecting, interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we take reasonable measures to secure it on our systems.

By using InterPals or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of those sites, products and services. We may post a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.interpals.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Changing your Preferences and Personal Information**  
You can edit your account information with InterPals at any time. Most personal information you may provide is entirely optional. For example, to the extent that parents are considering whether to permit their children to use Interpals, we do not condition a child's participation based upon their provision of any more personal information than is necessary to operate those sites, products and services.

You can delete your applicable account by visiting the applicable account deletion page; however, please note that some personal information, primarily your contact information, may remain in our records to the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Personal data processing and deletion of personal data**  
Interpals collects personal user data when a user creates or edits an account. This information includes name, birthday, gender, current city, home city, email address and other data voluntarily supplied by the user including photographs and description text. This data is stored on Interpals servers and a subset of it is made public to other users on the site via a user's public profile. Non-public data including email and passwords are used for authentication purposes and for notifications.  
  
In compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), at a user's request, Interpals will delete all user data from its servers. To request data deletion, a user must send an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.interpals.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) requesting "Permanent data deletion" and including the username of the profile in question. If the email is received from an email address other than the one used to register the account, supplemental identity verification will be required.

You can delete your applicable account by visiting the applicable account deletion page; however, please note that some personal information, primarily your contact information, may remain in our records to the extent necessary to protect our legal interests or document compliance with regulatory requirements.
