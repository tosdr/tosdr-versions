==========================

**1\. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS**  

Welcome to the InterPals Social Networking Service (hereon, the "Service") provided by InterPals, LLC (hereon, “InterPals”). Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms of Service ("TOS"). InterPals reserves the right to update and change the TOS from time to time without notice or acceptance by you. The TOS will also be applicable to the use of the Service on a trial basis. By using the Service, you signify your irrevocable acceptance of this TOS, as amended by InterPals periodically and acknowledge that changes to this agreement may be made at any time.

**2.1** The Service is web-based and allows users that register for an account on the Service (an "Account Holder") to create and update an online profile on InterPals’ Internet property.

**2.2** Once registered with the Service, each Account Holder receives his or her own Profile to post "Content" (as such term is defined in Section 7). Each Profile has limited disk space. The type and number of tools you may use depend on the type of account you have. Users are also allowed to contact other users via a Private Message and message board (“Wall”) system. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new InterPals.net tools and resources, shall be subject to the TOS.
