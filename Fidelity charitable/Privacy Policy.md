Privacy Policy
==============

* * *

This privacy policy is applicable to donors and individuals visiting this website or otherwise interacting with the Fidelity Investments Charitable Gift Fund (“Fidelity Charitable”) directly or through its service provider National Charitable Services LLC, a Fidelity Investments company (“NCS”). If you represent a company, advisor or non-profit entity that has a business relationship with Fidelity Charitable or National Charitable Services, please see the [National Charitable Services privacy policy](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/legal/ncs-privacy-policy.html) to learn more about its privacy practices.

Our commitment to privacy
-------------------------

Since our establishment in 1991, Fidelity Charitable has recognized the importance of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personal information about our current and potential donors. When you provide personal information to Fidelity Charitable, we believe that you should be aware of our policies designed to protect the privacy of this information and how we use it to service a Giving Account.

As used in this privacy policy, personal information means information about an individual that is collected and maintained in carrying out our activities, and by which the individual can be identiﬁed. Please note that information by which an individual cannot be identiﬁed (for example, anonymous, de-identified, or aggregate information) is not considered personal information and therefore is not subject to this policy.

We hope you will take a moment to review our privacy policy, including certain aspects that depend on whether you deal with us directly or through a financial advisor or authorized representative.

How and why we obtain personal information
------------------------------------------

Fidelity Charitable recognizes the importance of maintaining personal information about you, and when we use it, we do so with respect for your privacy. We obtain and use personal information about you to service, maintain, and protect your Giving Account; process transactions in your Giving Account; respond to inquiries from you or your representative; develop, oﬀer, and deliver charitable giving programs and services; operate and carry out our activities; and fulﬁll legal and regulatory requirements. Fidelity Charitable collects public and non-public personal information from customers and visitors from various sources. Some examples include:

* You or your representative on applications or forms (for example, when you interact with us via phone or on the web, or when you visit our websites or use our applications)
* You or your representative regarding your preferences (for example, your choice of electronic statement delivery)
* Transactional activity in your Giving Account (for example, contributions, pool exchanges, and grant recommendations)
* Other interactions with Fidelity Charitable (for example, webinars, events, interactions with our virtual assistant, use of two factor authentication)
* Information from consumer reporting agencies (for example, for fraud prevention purposes)
*  Information from other third-party sources (for example, to verify your identity, update your contact information and to process transactions on your behalf)
* Other sources with your consent or with the consent of your representative (for example, if you contribute assets from other institutions, or if you interact with our social media services)

How we protect your information
-------------------------------

We implement and maintain physical, administrative, technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information and we regularly adapt these controls to respond to changing requirements and advances in technology.

Privacy, security, and service online are just as critical as the rest of our operations. Fidelity Charitable works with our online systems service provider, National Charitable Services®, LLC (a Fidelity Investments company), to secure Fidelity Charitable systems from unauthorized access and to maintain the security of your online sessions. We use firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among other controls, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect systems from unauthorized access.

How we share information about you with third parties
-----------------------------------------------------

Within Fidelity Charitable and among our service providers, we restrict access to personal information to those who require it to provide our services to you. For example, Fidelity Charitable has entered into a number of arrangements with Fidelity Investments® to provide investment management and administrative services to Fidelity Charitable.

Fidelity Charitable does not sell or rent donor names or information to any firm or non-profit organization. Fidelity Charitable has entered into fundraising arrangements with Fidelity Investments to offer and provide our programs to their customers. However, we do not share donor information with Fidelity Investments or any other firm or nonprofit organization for their marketing or fundraising purposes without your (or your authorized representative’s) consent. You do not have to contact us to benefit from these protections; they apply automatically to all our donors.

We may share personal information with the following entities:

* Unaffiliated service providers (for example, printing and mailing companies, securities clearinghouses, marketing service providers, and other entities who may provide services at our direction)
* Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (for example, for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions)
* Other third-parties, with your consent or as directed by your representative (for example, if you request to transfer assets from another financial institution, or if you use an external aggregation website or service that you have provided permission to access your Giving Account on your behalf)
* Other third parties whose products, services and investment offerings are made available through Fidelity Charitable, and which you decide to utilize.
* Other organizations as permitted or required by law (for example for fraud prevention or to respond to a subpoena)
* In connection with corporate business transactions, such as a merger or sale of a business.
