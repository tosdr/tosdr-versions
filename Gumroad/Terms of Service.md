Your use of, and participation in, certain Services may be subject to additional terms ("**Supplemental Terms**") and such Supplemental Terms will either be listed in the Terms of Service or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental Services. If the Terms of Service are inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control with respect to such Services. The Terms of Service and any applicable Supplemental Terms are collectively referred to herein as the "**Agreement**."

**1\.               OVERVIEW OF OUR SERVICES.**

**1.1           Gumroad Merchant of Record Services.** The Services enable sellers of digital products ("**Suppliers**") that have a Supplier Account (as defined below) with Gumroad to appoint Gumroad as such Suppliers' non-exclusive reseller of certain of their digital products that Gumroad deems eligible for resale through the Services ("**Digital Products**" or "**Products**"). Products offered for resale by Gumroad are available to buyers ("**Buyers**") either on the Website, or on the applicable Supplier's owned or controlled website(s) ("**Supplier Property**") that leverages the Services. For clarity, Gumroad will have no responsibility or obligation with respect to any transactions that are not conducted through the Services.

**1.2           Gumroad Affiliate Program**. A Supplier may voluntarily participate in the [Gumroad Affiliate Program](https://help.gumroad.com/article/129-gumroad-affiliates), which allows the Supplier to designate one (1) or more eligible users who is bound by the terms and conditions of the Gumroad Affiliate Program as an affiliate (each, an "**Affiliate**"). An Affiliate is permitted to promote the applicable Supplier's Digital Product(s) by publishing Links (as defined below) on such Affiliate's website(s) or otherwise sharing the Links with prospective Buyers, and such Affiliate will earn financial compensation from the applicable Supplier (each, a "**Payout**") upon the completion of a sale of the applicable Supplier's Digital Product(s) that originated from the Links (each such sale, an "**Affiliate Transaction**"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Gumroad Affiliate Program. "**Links**" means embedded graphics, icons, text, or HTML code provided by Gumroad that contains a unique hypertext pointed to a Universal Resource Locator (URL) address to the Supplier's Digital Product(s) that allows Gumroad to identify the Affiliate as the source of an Affiliate Transaction. A "**Sourced Webpage**" means the Website, the Affiliate's website(s), or third-party websites on which the Links are published. For each completed Affiliate Transaction, the Affiliate will receive a fee equal to the retail price (determined by Supplier in its sole discretion) of the applicable Digital Product multiplied by an affiliate percentage (the "**Payout Rate**") determined by the Supplier for such Digital Product at the moment the Affiliate Transaction is completed (such resulting amount, the "**Affiliate Fee**"). By way of example, if a Digital Product is sold at a retail price of $10 through a Transaction and the Payout Rate is set to ten percent (10%), the Affiliate Fee would be equal to $10 multiplied by 10%, or $1.

**2\.               INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS**. When interacting with other users you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don't know. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users (including Buyers and/or Suppliers) and any other parties with whom you interact; provided, however, that Gumroad reserves the right, but has no obligation, to provide support in the event of disputes between users. YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER GUMROAD NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES, AND THAT GUMROAD MAKES NO REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO INTERACTIONS BETWEEN USERS. GUMROAD AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

**3\.               USE OF THE SERVICES.** The Services, and the information and content available on the Services, are protected by copyright and other intellectual property rights laws throughout the world. Unless otherwise specified by Gumroad in a separate license, your right to use any and all of the Services is subject to the Agreement.

**3.2           Application License.** Subject to your compliance with the Agreement, Gumroad grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install and use a copy of the Application on a single mobile device or computer that you own or control and to run such copy of the Application solely for your own personal or lawful business purposes. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an "**App Store Sourced Application**"), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs on iOS (Apple's proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the "Usage Rules" set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms of Service, except that such App Store Sourced Application may be accessed, acquired, and used by other accounts associated with the purchaser via Apple's Family Sharing function, volume purchasing, or Legacy Contacts function. Notwithstanding the first sentence in this section, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play store (a "**Google Play Sourced Application**"), you may have additional license rights with respect to use of the Application on a shared basis within your designated family group.

**3.3           Updates.** You understand that the Services are evolving. As a result, Gumroad may require you to accept updates to the Services that you have installed on your computer or mobile device.

**3.4           Gumroad Communications.** By entering into this Agreement or using the Services, you agree to receive communications from us, including via e-mail, text message, calls, and/or push notifications.

              **1.2           Additional Identity Verification.** Gumroad reserves the right, but has no obligation, to request additional information from Buyers or Suppliers to verify identity in order to safeguard the integrity of the Platform and reduce the risk of fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, and the violation of trade sanctions.

You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Gumroad and/or grant Gumroad access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Gumroad to pay any fees or making Gumroad subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers.

Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, all SNS Content shall be considered to be Your Content (as defined in Section 12.1 (Types of Content)) for all purposes of the Agreement. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your Account on the Services. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable, or Gumroad's access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Services. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third-Party Accounts at any time by accessing the "Settings" section of the Services. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND GUMROAD DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS. Gumroad makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and Gumroad is not responsible for any SNS Content.

You may not share your Account or password with anyone, and you agree to (y) notify Gumroad immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security; and (z) exit from your Account at the end of each session. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Gumroad has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Gumroad has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof). You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself. You agree that you shall not have more than one Account per platform or SNS at any given time. Gumroad reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims by a third party that a username violates the third party's rights. You agree not to create an Account or use the Services if you have been previously removed by Gumroad, or if you have been previously banned from any of the Services.

**5\.               THIRD-PARTY PAYMENTS PROVIDERS.** Gumroad currently uses Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates, as well as PayPal, as third-party service providers for payment processing services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services) (each, a **"Third-Party Payments Provider"**). By through the Services, you (a) agree to be bound by, in the case of Stripe, Stripe's Privacy Policy (currently accessible at [https://stripe.com/us/privacy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy)) and its Stripe Connected Account Agreement (currently accessible at [https://stripe.com/legal/connect-account](https://stripe.com/legal/connect-account)); and in the case of PayPal, PayPal's Privacy Statement (currently accessible at [https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full)) and its terms of service (currently accessible at [https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full?locale.x=en\_US](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full?locale.x=en_US)); (b) agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information about you and to update such information as necessary to maintain its truth and accuracy; and (c) and you hereby consent and authorize Gumroad, Stripe and PayPal to share any information and payment instructions you provide with one or more Third-Party Payments Provider(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.

**6.1           Appointment**. You hereby appoint Gumroad as your non-exclusive reseller of the Digital Products (including any subsequent updates and upgrades thereto) that you expressly agree to be resold by Gumroad and that Gumroad deems eligible for resale through the Services. To be deemed eligible for resale through the Services, Digital Products must meet product eligibility requirements, and Gumroad has the sole discretion to determine and change from time to time the product categories and products that are eligible for resale through the Services.

**7\.             REFUNDS, CHARGEBACKS, DISPUTES.** The following provisions in this Section 7 (Refunds, Chargebacks, Disputes) govern the obligations and responsibilities of both Suppliers and Buyers:

7.1           If you are a Supplier:

**(a)**             Gumroad will handle Buyers' requests for refunds, chargebacks and other disputes with Buyers in Gumroad's sole discretion. The Supplier shall, at Gumroad's request, provide all information as may be requested by Gumroad to resolve Buyers' requests or disputes. Supplier is responsible for reimbursing Gumroad for the amount of any monies paid by Gumroad to Buyers or Third-Party Service Providers, or any other parties, in connection with refunds, chargebacks or disputes, as well as for any other reasonable costs incurred by Gumroad in resolving these requests.

7.2           If you are a Buyer:

**(a)**             It is the Buyer's sole responsibility to appropriately handle, remove or destroy any Digital Product that may cause Buyer to: (i) incur additional liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and/or civil liability; or (ii) experience additional adverse effects, including, but not limited to, potential privacy, security, or technical vulnerabilities.

**(b)**             If you request a refund and also pursue a dispute resolution process for the same transaction with your payment method provider for the applicable purchase, we will decline your refund request. This will not affect the dispute resolution process with your payment method provider. You agree not to submit a refund request for any Product if you have already chosen to pursue a dispute resolution process with your payment method provider.

**8\.              PURCHASING PRODUCTS.**

**8.1           Purchasing Process.** A Buyer may purchase Products through the Services with or without an Account. Having an Account allows a Buyer to access the Buyer's purchase history and the purchased Digital Products through the Buyer's Gumroad Library anytime. To purchase a Product, a Buyer must complete the checkout process and provide an authorized payment method. Except as set forth below, all purchases through the Platform are final and Buyer is responsible for all approved charges. All payments by Buyers for purchases through the Platform must be made through the Platform using a payment method that Gumroad in its sole discretion makes available through the Platform as further described in Section 1 (Third-Party Payments Providers).

**8.2           Purchasing Subscriptions through the Services.**

(a)            Subscriptions and Automatic Renewal. The Services may allow a Buyer to purchase access to a Digital Product on a subscription basis (a **"Subscription"**). The Subscription will continue and automatically renew at Gumroad's then-current price until terminated in accordance with the Agreement. The price will be billed at the start of the Subscription and at regular intervals (i.e. monthly, annually, etc.) designated at purchase (**"Subscription Period"**). By subscribing, the Buyer authorizes Gumroad to charge the payment method in the Buyer's Account at the beginning of each Subscription Period. If Gumroad does not receive payment upon renewal: (i) The Buyer shall pay all amounts due upon demand and/or (ii) Gumroad may terminate or suspend the Subscription and continue attempting to charge the designated payment method until payment is received. Upon receipt, the Account will be activated and the new Subscription Period will begin from the payment date. Gumroad reserves the right to change prices at any time. For price changes affecting a Subscription, Gumroad will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Buyer, such as emailing the address on the Account. The Buyer may cancel through the "Cancel Membership" flow if they disagree with changes. To prevent automatic renewal or to change/terminate a Subscription, the Buyer must contact Gumroad through the Platform's in-app live chat.

(b)            Effect of Cancellation.. If the Buyer cancel the Subscription, the Buyer may use the Subscription until the end of the Buyer’s then-current Subscription term; the Subscription will not be renewed after the then-current term expires. However, the Buyer will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Subscription price paid for the then-current Subscription Period.

**9\.              CURRENCY CONVERSION.** If the retail price of a Product is listed in a currency other than United States Dollars (USD), Gumroad will calculate a USD price based upon an exchange rate determined by Gumroad. Gumroad uses exchange rates obtained from [http://openexchangerates.org/api](https://docs.openexchangerates.org/reference/api-introduction). Gumroad cannot and does not guarantee that the exchange rate displayed reflects the most up to date rate due to the fluctuating nature of exchange rates. Accordingly, Gumroad recommends that you confirm current rates before engaging in any transactions on the Platform. Regardless of listed currency, all transactions through the Services will settle in USD.

**10\.           TAXES.**

**10.1         Meaning of Indirect Tax.** **"Indirect Tax"** includes any sales, use, value added or goods and services tax, any similar tax on sales, turnover or consumption, and any import, customs and similar taxes, duties and tariffs, together, in each case in any jurisdiction and together with any related penalties and interest.

**10.2        Indirect Tax on Resales through the Services.** As the merchant of record, Gumroad will be treated as the supplier, for relevant Indirect Tax purposes, in respect of Products resold by Gumroad through the Services, and, subject to as provided pursuant to these Terms of Services, will be responsible for the administration, collection, reporting and remittance of any relevant Indirect Tax (except in limited circumstances where the Buyer may be responsible, for example as outlined in Section 10.5 below). When the treatment of Gumroad as a supplier is not a relevant consideration for Indirect Tax purposes, if Gumroad determines it is responsible for the administration, collection, reporting and remittance of Indirect Tax in connection with Products resold through the Services, Gumroad will collect and remit the Indirect Tax in addition to the amounts otherwise required under these Terms of Services.

**10.3        Indirect Tax on Gumroad Fees.** In some circumstances, Gumroad Fees may be subject to Indirect Tax. Where appropriate, Gumroad will be responsible for the administration, collection, reporting and remittance of such Indirect Tax, although in some circumstances the Buyer may be responsible (for example if a Buyer is required to account for value added tax or goods and services tax outside the United States under a "reverse charge" mechanism).

**10.4        Indirect Tax on Affiliate Fees.** In some circumstances, Affiliate Fees may be subject to Indirect Tax. Affiliates will be responsible for the administration, collection, reporting and remittance of any such Indirect Tax.

**10.5        Indirect Tax for Buyers.** Buyers may in some circumstances be responsible for Indirect Taxes. Buyers outside the United States may also, in some circumstances, be required to account for value added tax or goods and services tax under a "reverse charge" mechanism.

**10.6        Direct Tax.** It is your personal responsibility to disclose your earnings to your relevant tax authority and you must ensure that you are paying the correct amount of tax. This is particularly relevant if you are operating as a business. Please be aware that Gumroad may in some circumstances be required to disclose information about you to tax authorities.

**10.7        Amounts Generally Exclusive of Indirect Tax.** Except where expressly stated otherwise, all prices on the Platform, and all amounts payable to Gumroad pursuant to this Agreement (or which reduce amounts payable by Gumroad), including Gumroad Fees, are exclusive of any applicable Indirect Tax, and additional payment shall be made to cover such Indirect Tax, at the same time as the payment to which such Indirect Tax relates. However, Affiliate Fees and any amounts payable by Gumroad pursuant to this Agreement are inclusive of any applicable Indirect Tax, and no additional amounts shall be payable by Gumroad in respect of such Indirect Tax.

**10.8        Payment of Tax by Gumroad.** Gumroad shall be entitled to deduct an amount equal to any Indirect Tax in connection with the resale of a Product from any amounts otherwise payable to the applicable Supplier and account for such Indirect Tax to the appropriate tax authority and/or to apply such withheld amount in satisfaction of Gumroad's liability in respect of such Indirect Tax. If Gumroad considers that any withholding or deduction on account of tax is required by applicable law to be made from any payment pursuant to this Agreement, it shall be entitled to make such withholding or deduction (and, for the avoidance doubt, shall not be required to increase or gross-up any payment on account of such withholding or deduction).

**11\.           ADDITIONAL SUPPLIER OBLIGATIONS.**

**11.1        Supplier’s Payment of Gumroad Fees.** Gumroad does not assess or collect "listing" or "insertion" fees, but will charge and collect from Supplier a per transaction fee for each resale made through the Services (the **"Gumroad Fee"**). The Gumroad Fees vary depending on whether a Product is resold on the Website or on the applicable Supplier Property that leverages the Services. The current Gumroad Fees can be viewed on the page "[Pricing](https://gumroad.com/pricing)". We may change the Gumroad Fees from time to time by posting the changes on the Website. Any new Gumroad Fee(s) will apply to transactions only after the changes are posted to the Website. The Gumroad Fee(s) owed for each resale through the Services is automatically deducted from the purchase price paid by the Buyer, with the remainder (less any amounts in respect of taxes and any other charges payable by you pursuant to this Agreement) settled or paid to Supplier in accordance with this Agreement. All purchases made by Buyer are processed by Gumroad and its Third-Party Services Providers on behalf of Supplier to facilitate the settlement of proceeds to Supplier (less applicable fees and taxes).

**11.2        Supplier’s Obligations and Restrictions on Supplier’s Activities through the Services.** In addition to other terms applicable to Suppliers in this Agreement, when you as a Supplier use the Services, you acknowledge and agree that:

**(a)** You will not, or attempt to, promote, distribute or deliver Products through the Services in any manner that: (i) violates, or may violate, the rules or policies of Card Networks or our Third-Party Payments Providers; (ii) is listed as [Prohibited Products and Activities](https://gumroad.com/prohibited) on the Website; (iii) constitutes illegal activity or is illegal; (iv) promotes or encourages discrimination based upon race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; (v) targets, or intends to distribute to, children under the age of thirteen (13) years old; (vi) or is abusive towards other people.

**(b)**            You will use best efforts to ensure that all communications, representations and warranties you make in connection with your Products will: (i) be accurate and contain all disclosures and disclaimers necessary to prevent such communications and/or representations from being false, deceptive, or misleading; and (ii) otherwise comply with all applicable laws, regulations, advisories, and policies related to consumer protection.

**(c)**            You agree to provide public-facing contact information and order fulfillment timelines for all Products.

**(d)**            You will not, or attempt to, engage in any activity that is intended to, or may be used to, circumvent the Gumroad Fee, and you will not require or suggest that a Buyer agree to any terms that reduce or limit Section 7 (Refunds, Chargebacks, Disputes) or otherwise impinge or interfere with Gumroad's rights under these Terms of Service or any other agreement.

**(f)**            You will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, court orders, third party rights, applicable industry requirements (including, but not limited to, any and all applicable provisions of the Visa International Operating Regulations, MasterCard Merchant Rules, and PCI compliance standards), and any Gumroad policy or standard that may be issued from time to time.

**(g)**            In the event you promote or deliver any Products that contain personal information of any other individual, you must have provided any such notice to data subjects that may be required under applicable law and, to the extent required under applicable law, established a legal basis for your use of such personal data.

**(h)**            If you send emails, directly or indirectly, in connection with any Product, then you agree, acknowledge, represent and warrant that all such emails, and procurement of email addresses thereto, shall be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and international laws and regulations regarding the use of electronic messages, including without limitation the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

**(i)**            If you send, initiate or procure a "call" (as that term is defined by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act), directly or indirectly, in connection with any Product, you agree, acknowledge, represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents and authorizations under, and will be in full compliance with, applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, and state laws related to anti-spam, text messages and Do-Not-Call Registries.

**11.3        Suspension or Termination of Supplier’s Account.**

**(a)**            Gumroad, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate Supplier's Account(s), or retain any or all funds pending settlement or not yet paid to you (as applicable), if Gumroad suspects or has reason to believe and/or if a person otherwise claims that Supplier has violated the law or breached any term of this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, and all other rights and remedies available to Gumroad at law or in equity and notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, in the event Supplier breaches any term of this Agreement, or Supplier's Account becomes dormant and/or has a negative balance, Gumroad will have the right to immediately suspend or terminate Supplier's Account and Supplier's rights to access, use and/or otherwise participate in the Platform. Upon such termination, Supplier agrees to immediately cease all use of the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, Gumroad shall have the right to immediately terminate Supplier's access and use of the Platform, or any portion thereof, in the event of any conduct that Gumroad, in its sole discretion, considers unacceptable. Gumroad shall also have the right to withhold funds pending settlement or not yet paid to you (as applicable) that are associated with activities or products that Gumroad considers in its sole discretion to be fraudulent or illegal under any applicable law. Following suspension or termination of Supplier's Account or retaining of funds pursuant to this Section, Gumroad will review Supplier's Account in a manner determined by Gumroad in its sole discretion. Supplier agrees to cooperate with this review if asked. If the review concludes that there is a reasonable basis to believe misconduct has occurred, Supplier agrees that Gumroad may retain funds in Supplier's Account as liquidated damages and/or for the benefit of Gumroad or third parties affected by the misconduct. Supplier acknowledges and agrees that such liquidated damages: (i) are not a penalty, and (ii) are reasonable and not disproportionate to such presumed damages to Gumroad.

**(b)**            If Supplier (or Gumroad, when selling a specific Supplier's Products) experiences a refund rate in excess of 15%, Supplier hereby authorizes us to hold in reserve an amount equal to 25% of Supplier's funds pending settlement or not yet paid to you (as applicable) for 90 days on a rolling basis to offset the potential cost of future refunds. If Supplier (or Gumroad, when selling a specific Supplier's Products) experiences a refund rate in excess of 25%, Supplier's Account may be suspended, terminated, or otherwise subject to additional conditions or fees.

**24\.           TERRITORIAL RESTRICTIONS.** The Services can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to Services and Content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that Gumroad intends to announce such Services or Content in your country. The Services are controlled and offered by Gumroad from its facilities in the United States of America. Gumroad makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

**25\.           ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section ("Arbitration Agreement") carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Gumroad and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. For the avoidance of doubt, this Arbitration Agreement does not govern disputes between you and another user.**

              **1.8        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Gumroad agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed by other users through the Services, or this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of the Agreement (each, a "**Dispute**") will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and Gumroad may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you or Gumroad may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, "Dispute" will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of the Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement does not apply to disputes between you and third parties.

**25.1        Informal Dispute Resolution.** There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Gumroad. If that occurs, Gumroad is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Gumroad agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Gumroad therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement ("**Informal Dispute Resolution Conference**"). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.

The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference ("**Notice**"), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Gumroad that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to support@gumroad.com or regular mail to our offices located at 548 Market St, PMB 41309, San Francisco, California 94104-5401 US. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e-mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.

The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party's Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this Section.

**25.2        Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND GUMROAD HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Gumroad are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 25.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement) above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

**25.3        Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.** YOU AND GUMROAD AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 25.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the Section 25.9 (Batch Arbitration). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section 25.4, (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Gumroad agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This Section 25.4 does not prevent you or Gumroad from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

**25.4        Rules and Forum.** The Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Gumroad agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA**"), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "**AAA Rules**") then in effect, except as modified by this Section 25.5 of this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at [https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf).

A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the **"Request"**). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.

If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel's name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.

Unless you and Gumroad otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 25.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.

You and Gumroad agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties' attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.

**25.5                  Arbitrator.** The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 25.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

**25.6                 Authority of Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 25.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 25.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that Section 25.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 25.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 25.9 (Batch Arbitration). The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

**25.7                 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.** The parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Gumroad need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution Process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

**25.8                 Batch Arbitration.** To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Gumroad agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Gumroad by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award ("**Batch Arbitration**").

All parties agree that Requests are of a "substantially similar nature" if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process ("**Administrative Arbitrator**"). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator's fees shall be paid by Gumroad.

You and Gumroad agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.

This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.

**25.9               30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 548 Market St, PMB 41309, San Francisco, California 94104-5401 US, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of the Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

**25.10               Invalidity, Expiration.** Except as provided in Section 25.4 (Waiver of Class or Other NonIndividualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Gumroad as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.

**25.11               Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Gumroad makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Gumroad at 548 Market St, PMB 41309, San Francisco, California 94104-5401 US, your continued use of the Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered through the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of the Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services, or the Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Agreement) remain in full force and effect. Gumroad will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of the Agreement.
