Pinterest uses the services of certain providers to help us analyze and improve our services.

On our website and apps, we use analytics providers, such as Google Analytics. You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google's Browser Opt-Out Add-On.

We sometimes use third-party advertising services to promote our own products and services. When you visit a Pinterest property, we allow those services to collect your mobile ad identifier, set or read cookies, and other information on your browser or device in order to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns. We may also use that information to target ads to you using those services. You can opt out of this type of personalization in settings. Learn about how we market Pinterest around the web.

You can control how those services use this and other information they collect about your web activity by visiting https://www.aboutads.info/choices.
