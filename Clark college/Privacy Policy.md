1. The Internet Protocol address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu); 
2. The type of browser and operating system you used; 
3. The date and time you visited this site; 
4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site. 
5. The website you visited prior to coming to this website, if you clicked on a link to take you here (referring sites or links).

### What we collect if you volunteer information

The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by Clark College only to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our services.

1. The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who communicate with us via e-mail.
2. Information volunteered in response to a survey.
3. Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other purpose.

The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

This may be to respond to you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our Web site, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used for research and enhancement purposes. Information from other on-line forms is used to fulfill student requests for information and/or services.

A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information.You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line.

You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an on-line form.
