### SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy applies to WeChat, as well as any services accessible on the WeChat platform that state that this Privacy Policy applies to the use of such service (for example, users that follow or use Official Accounts, Mini Programs and WeChat Login for third-party apps). Those WeChat services may have further privacy-related terms that you must agree to if you use those services. Any capitalised terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as the equivalent defined terms in the WeChat Terms of Service, unless they are defined otherwise in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to Information that you choose to disclose or submit to:

a) services other than WeChat (such as other products or services supplied or operated by us or our affiliates), that do not expressly state that this Privacy Policy applies;

b) any third party services (including any third party websites) that you may access through WeChat; or

If you or any Connected Persons would like to request your personal information be removed from our database, please contact us at dataprotection@wechat.com.

### WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU NEED TO PROVIDE WECHAT?

This section describes the different types of personal information we collect from you and how we collect it. If you would like to know more about specific types of data and how we use that data, please see the section entitled [**"How do we use your information"**](https://www.wechat.com/en/privacy_policy.html#pp_how) below.

We process different categories of information and data in providing WeChat. These are set out below:

* when you use location-based features, such as People Nearby, POI search, WeRun, and when you share your location with other WeChat users; and
    
* when you access WeChat, as we derive location information from your IP address, device, or internet service to prevent multiple or fraudulent log-ins to your account.
    

**"Log Data"** is information that we automatically collect when you use WeChat, whether through the use of cookies, web beacons, log files, scripts or ETags (as explained in more detail in our [Cookies Policy](https://www.wechat.com/mobile/htdocs/en/cookies_policy.html)), including:

* metadata, which means information related to items you have made available through WeChat, such as the date, time or location that a shared photograph or video was taken or posted.
    
    **"Non-Personal Information"** is any information that is not reasonably practicable to directly or indirectly identify you.
    

**"Personal Information"** is any information, or combination of information, that relates to you, that can be used (directly or indirectly) to identify you. We set out examples of Personal Information (and how we collect such Personal Information) in [_**"How do we use your information"**_](https://www.wechat.com/mobile/htdocs/en/privacy_policy7.html) below.

**"Shared Information"** is information about you or relating to you that is voluntarily shared by you on WeChat. Shared Information may include postings that you make on WeChat (including your public profile, the lists you create, and photos, videos and voice recordings as accessed with your prior consent through your device’s camera and/or microphone sensor), any postings from others that you re-post and Location Data and Log Data associated with such postings. Shared Information also includes information about you (including Location Data and Log Data) that others who are using WeChat share about you.

### SHARED INFORMATION

WeChat enables certain information to be shared publicly with your WeChat contacts and other users of WeChat. At any time you can hide your profile from public view and search by unchecking "allow find by phone number, WeChat ID or QQ ID" in your account settings. This means that other users of WeChat will not be able to find you. We refer to this type of information above as Shared Information. Shared Information will remain publicly-available for so long as you or a user that has shared such information retains it. Even after you delete Shared Information, it may still be separately cached, copied, or stored by, or remain public through, other users or third parties who are not affiliated with and not controlled by us.

Where you have requested that we erase your Personal Information that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the Personal Information or providing links to the Personal Information to erase it too.

**Please consider carefully what you post and communicate through WeChat.** In some instances, you may control what access the wider public has to your Shared Information via the privacy settings in WeChat.

### COMMUNICATIONS FROM US

We may from time to time send you service-related announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (such as when we temporarily suspend WeChat for maintenance, or security, privacy, or administrative-related communications). We send these to your email address or via SMS. You may not opt-out of these service-related announcements, which are not promotional in nature and used solely to protect your account and keep you informed of important changes to WeChat.

### SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION

In some jurisdictions, certain types of Personal Information, such as information about your race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical views or personal health, is characterised as "sensitive" and is subject to stricter regulation than other types of Personal Information. Please note that content and information that you input to WeChat, such as photographs or information about your school or social activities, may reveal your sensitive Personal Information to others.

Before communicating any Personal Information of a sensitive nature within WeChat, please consider whether it is appropriate to do so.

**By posting any Personal Information of a sensitive nature within WeChat, you are consenting to such information being available within the controls you have selected (for example, available to the audience of users you select as being capable of viewing your post or profile information).**

### SOCIAL MEDIA SHARING

_**Sharing Your WeChat Data outside of WeChat**_

Some WeChat-related features allow you to provide Shared Information to those outside of your WeChat network – for example, publicly accessible blogs and forums, or certain social media features within WeChat (such as "plug-ins" (which create a direct link between two websites) and "widgets" (which are interactive Mini Programs that provide third party services within WeChat)) allow you to re-post and disclose Shared Information. If you share information using these features then third parties unrelated to us may be able to see and use that information.

You are also able to link your WeChat contact list with the contact lists on your device and/or in your account on third party services, in order to search for and connect with contacts on those contact lists who also have a WeChat account. WeChat will ask you to consent to accessing your contact list before doing so.

_**Accessing and Importing Information using WeChat**_

WeChat allows you to link your WeChat services with select third party social media services, and import certain content and information from such third party services. For example:

* _you may share content on, or login to, WeChat using services provided by third parties._ These third party services will authenticate you and provide you with the option of sharing certain Personal Information with us. They may also give you the option to post information from your third party service account to WeChat as Shared Information.
    
* _you may login to WeChat using other sign-in services such as an Open ID provider._ These sign-in services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us for account registration and login purposes, such as your name and email address; and
    
* _WeChat may (whether in banners, pop-ups or otherwise within WeChat) provide you with links or features that allow you to access third party services or websites (or access within WeChat content that is hosted on those third party services or websites)._ For example, you may be able to access videos hosted by a third party without leaving the WeChat application.
    

Third party social media platforms are hosted by the relevant third party. WeChat services are hosted by us. Third parties that provide third party services may collect your Information (including your Personal Information and Log Data), and set cookies on your computer, or device to enable such features to function properly.

Your use of any third party services (whether social media services or otherwise), including any Personal Information you provide to such third parties and their collection and use of your Personal Information, are subject to the relevant third party’s own terms of services and privacy policies and not the _WeChat Terms of Service_ or this Privacy Policy, so please review those third party terms carefully.

**This Privacy Policy only applies to any Information collected by us, and does not apply to any services offered by or information practices of any third parties. If you choose to use third party services or features that are made available within WeChat (for example, you choose to follow an Official Account or use a Mini Program), then we will share certain information with that third party to allow you to use that third party service.

### HOW CAN I EXERCISE MY RIGHTS OVER MY DATA?

_Some countries' laws grant specific rights to users of WeChat, which are set out in this section._

**The following section applies only to persons that are resident in the European Economic Area.**

You have certain rights in relation to the Personal Information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances as set out in more detail below.

We set out how to exercise those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, such as where the request involves substantial volumes of information or is otherwise complex). To exercise any of your rights, please complete the [request form](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request) and follow the steps for submission.

_**Access & Correction**_

Upon request WeChat will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You also have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You also have the right to correct that information.

You can access and correct your personal information by logging into your **WeChat account** at any time. For example, you can delete certain Location Data that you have provided us via your device settings or the "Clear Location" option within WeChat.

If you believe we hold any other personal information, or you want to correct information that you are unable to correct using your account, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request). We may not be able to provide you with certain Personal Information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information about another person).

With respect to correction requests, where we agree that the Personal Information is inaccurate or incomplete, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can rectify the Personal Information too.

_**Erasure**_

You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your WeChat account and following the account deletion instructions [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter). If there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

You may request that we erase the Personal Information we hold about you in the following circumstances:

* you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to have your Personal Information;
    
* we obtained your consent to process the Personal Information and you withdraw that consent (and we have no other grounds for processing the Personal Information);
    
* you believe we are unlawfully processing your Personal Information; or
    
* you are or were under the age of 16 when we collected the Personal Information and we can verify your age.
    

Also note that you may exercise your right to restrict our processing your Personal Information (as described below) whilst we consider a request to erase your data.

Please note, however, that we may retain the Personal Information if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims, freedom of expression or some other legal obligation) but we will let you know if that is the case.

Where you have requested that we erase your Personal Information that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the Personal Information or providing links to the Personal Information to erase it too.

_**Restriction of Processing to Storage Only**_

You have a right to require us to stop processing the Personal Information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the Personal Information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection law for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection).

Where we agree to stop processing the Personal Information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can stop processing it too.

You may request we stop processing and just store the Personal Information we hold about you where:

* you believe the Personal Information is not accurate (for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate);
    
* we wish to erase the Personal Information as the processing we are doing is unlawful (but you want us to retain the Personal Information and just store it instead); or
    
* we wish to erase the Personal Information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes (but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims).
    

_**Portability**_

You have the right to receive a copy of certain Personal Information we collect from you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., voluntarily-provided profile data, social media content posted to Moments and Time Capsule, content selected to store to Favorites) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., profile data), as described in the section [_**"How do we use your information"**_](https://www.wechat.com/mobile/htdocs/en/privacy_policy7.html). You have the right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party. You can exercise your right to export your data by following the instructions [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter).

If you wish for us to transfer the Personal Information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the Personal Information or its processing once received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain Personal Information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).

_**Objection**_

You may object to our use of your Personal Information if we use your information on the basis of our legitimate interests (such as when we use your personal information for your account security, such as to prevent malicious log-ins). If you object to such processing, please review and submit the form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request), providing detailed reasons.

To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us by following the instructions set out [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter).

_**HOW WILL WE NOTIFY YOU OF CHANGES?**_

We may from time to time revise or add specific instructions, policies and terms to this Privacy Policy. These instructions, policies and terms form part of this Privacy Policy.

Whenever we make any changes to this Privacy Policy that are important for you to know about, we will post the updated Privacy Policy at this link and notify you via WeChat or other means before the change becomes effective.

### Using the WeChat Open Platform

You are using the WeChat Open Platform because you activated a service from a third-party by following an Official Account, opening a Mini Program, or using WeChat Login on a third-party app or web site. When activating a service, a small amount of data about you (user alias, profile photo, region, gender) is transferred and stored on our secure servers in the China mainland in order to make this information accessible to the third-party service. Transfers of data outside of the European Economic Area are governed by the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as specified in the WeChat Privacy Policy. Any other information you disclose to the 3rd-party service (e.g. contact info) is governed by the 3rd-party service operator's Privacy Policy and WeChat does not have access to such information.

If you don't wish to use the WeChat Open Platform, [learn how to remove my data from the WeChat Open Platform](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=1803233auaIv180323aaeaM7&Channel=helpcenter).

  

WECHAT PRIVACY POLICY
=====================

**Last Updated:** 2024-04-12

**SUMMARY**

Thank you for using WeChat! We respect your concerns about privacy and appreciate your trust and confidence in us.

Here is a summary of the information contained in this privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**"). This summary is to help you navigate the Privacy Policy and it is not a substitute for reading everything! You can use the hyperlinks below to jump directly to particular sections in the Privacy Policy.

**DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO YOU?**

This Privacy Policy only applies to you if you are a **WeChat user**, meaning that you have registered by linking a mobile number that uses an international dialing code other than +86 ("**non-Chinese Mainland mobile number**").

This Privacy Policy does not apply to you if you are a **Weixin user**. You are a Weixin user if you have either:

* registered by linking a mobile number that uses international dialing code +86 ("**Chinese Mainland mobile number**"); or
* contracted with 深圳市腾讯计算机系统有限公司(Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited) for Weixin.

**If you are a Weixin user, you are subject to the [Weixin Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) and [Weixin Privacy Protection Guidelines](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=privacy&cc=CN) and not this Privacy Policy.**

You can check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by clicking "Me" > "Settings" > "About" and then clicking the link to the "Terms of Service". If you see the WeChat – Terms of Service then you are a WeChat user. If you see the Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin then you are a Weixin user. Alternatively, if you are using the latest version of WeChat, you can also check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by verifying the service name listed in the header at the top of the "Chats" screen. If you see "WeChat" in the header then you are a WeChat user, whereas a Weixin user will see "Weixin" (or "微信" for users viewing in a Chinese language interface).

**_If you subsequently change your phone number (either from a Chinese Mainland mobile number to a non-Chinese Mainland mobile number, or vice versa) you will be required to convert your account (to either a WeChat or Weixin account, depending on your new phone number). If you convert your Weixin account to a WeChat account, this Privacy Policy applies to you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert your WeChat account to a Weixin account, this Privacy Policy ceases to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion._**

**WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU NEED TO PROVIDE WECHAT?**

When you register for a WeChat account, we will need your mobile number and an alias. You can further refine and populate your profile with additional information. If you use certain functions available within WeChat (such as posting photos to your Moments), we will process your information to provide these functions. [**More Information**](#pp_how)

**HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**

We use your information to provide WeChat to you, allow you to communicate with other users, allow you to use the features available on WeChat, and to improve and support your WeChat experience. If you are a parent or guardian who has granted permission for your child to use WeChat then we retain the contact information you have provided to ensure we can validate any requests or queries you may have in relation to your child's WeChat account. [**More Information**](#pp_how)

**WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR DATA WITH?**

We do not share your information with third parties, except where we need to in order to provide the service (e.g., SMS service providers) or if we are instructed to by a court, authority or compelled by law. We use these third party services solely to process or store your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy . Any third party with whom we share user data is required to provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in this Privacy Policy. [**More Information**](#pp_sharing)

**WHERE DO WE PROCESS YOUR DATA?**

Our servers are located in Singapore and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ("**Hong Kong SAR**"). We also have support, engineering and other teams that support the provision of WeChat to you, located around the world (including Singapore and the Netherlands), who will have access to your information.

1\. INTRODUCTION
----------------

Welcome to WeChat!

When you use the WeChat mobile app, desktop app, or the websites [www.wechat.com](https://www.wechat.com/) or [help.wechat.com](https://help.wechat.com/) (together, **"WeChat"**), certain of your Personal Information (defined below) will be collected and processed by us.

This Privacy Policy explains the when, how and why when it comes to processing of your Personal Information in connection with WeChat, and sets out your choices and rights in relation to that Personal Information.

**Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to WeChat. If you use any other products or services please refer to the privacy policy for that particular product or service.**

**If you do not agree to the processing of your personal information in the way this Privacy Policy describes, please do not provide your information when requested and stop using WeChat. By using WeChat you are acknowledging how we process your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.**

In this Privacy Policy, **"we"**, **"our"** or **"us"** refers to:

* if you are a WeChat user located (as determined by your currently registered mobile number) in the EEA, the UK or Switzerland: **Tencent International Service Europe B.V.**, a Dutch company, located at Buitenveldertselaan 1-5, 1082 VA, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and

**CONTACT**

If you have any questions or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy or the use of your Personal Information, please contact our Data Protection Officer via email at [**dataprotection@wechat.com**](mailto:dataprotection@wechat.com) or via postal mail at **Buitenveldertselaan 1-5, 1082 VA, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Attention: Data Protection Officer, Legal Department)**. We have representatives for data protection purposes listed here.

Please note that if you are a resident in the EEA, the UK or Switzerland you have the right to lodge a complaint with your country's data protection authority.

2\. SCOPE AND APPLICATION
-------------------------

This Privacy Policy only applies to you if you are a **WeChat user**.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to you if you are a **Weixin user**. You are a Weixin user if you had either:

* registered by linking a Chinese Mainland mobile number; or
* contracted with 深圳市腾讯计算机系统有限公司 (Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited) for Weixin.

**If you are a Weixin user, you are subject to the [Weixin Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=default&cc=CN) and [Weixin Privacy Protection Guidelines](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=en_US&t=weixin_agreement&s=privacy&cc=CN) and not this Privacy Policy.**

You can check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by clicking "Me" > "Settings" > "About" and then clicking the link to the "Terms of Service". If you see the WeChat – Terms of Service then you are a WeChat user. If you see the Agreement on Software License and Service of Tencent Weixin then you are a Weixin user. Alternatively, if you are using the latest version of WeChat, you can also check whether you are a WeChat or Weixin user by verifying the service name listed in the header at the top of the "Chats" screen. If you see "WeChat" in the header then you are a WeChat user, whereas a Weixin user will see "Weixin" (or "微信" for users viewing in a Chinese language interface).

**_If you subsequently change your phone number (either from a Chinese Mainland mobile number to a non-Chinese Mainland mobile number, or vice versa) you will be required to convert your account (to either a WeChat or Weixin account, depending on your new phone number). If you convert your Weixin account to a WeChat account, this Privacy Policy applies to you from the date our system records such conversion. If you convert your WeChat account to a Weixin account, this Privacy Policy ceases to apply to you from the date our system records such conversion._**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected by third party services that you may access through the WeChat platform (e.g., features operated by Weixin such as Advanced Search, Channels, Top Stories, and WeBeans; Weixin Open Platform services including Official Accounts, Mini Programs, and Weixin Login; Weixin Pay or WeChat Pay; or a third-party web site viewed via the internal browser), and Personal Information that you choose to share with a Weixin user. Please refer to the privacy policy of the relevant third party service. For more information, please see the section entitled [**"Who do we share your data with?"**](#pp_sharing) below.

If you are using WeChat on behalf of a company, partnership, association, government or other organisation (your "**Organisation**"), you agree to notify such persons in your Organisation whose Personal Information (defined below) we collect or you provide to us ("**Connected Persons**"), and you agree to obtain such Connected Persons' consent to the processing of their Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable laws and regulations. When this Privacy Policy refers to "you"or "your", this includes you and any Connected Persons. If you or any Connected Persons would like to request for your Personal Information to be removed from our database, please contact us at [dataprotection@wechat.com](mailto:dataprotection@wechat.com).

You may have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below). Please note that in order to protect your information, we will need to verify your identity before responding to any request to exercise your rights ("**DSR Request**"). To exercise any of your rights, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

**Access & Correction**

**This section also applies to users resident in Argentina, Canada and Russia.**

You have the right to request access to your Personal Information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. We may not be able to provide you with certain Personal Information if providing it to you would interfere with another person's rights (e.g. where providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information about another person).

You also have the right to correct that information if it is inaccurate or incomplete.

You can access and correct your Personal Information by logging into your WeChat account at any time. For example, you can delete certain Location Data via your device settings or the "Clear Location" option within WeChat.

If you want us to correct your Personal Information that you are unable to correct using your account, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

Where we agree to correct your Personal Information, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can rectify the Personal Information too.

**Erasure**

**This section also applies to users resident in Argentina, Canada and Russia.**

You can delete your account, or remove certain Personal Information, by logging into your WeChat account and following the account deletion instructions [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter). Subsequent to account deletion, aggregated registration data is retained for spam prevention and systems security purposes.

Note that we will not be able to delete your account if you have a positive balance in your Weixin Pay or WeChat Pay account or are the administrator of an Official Account or Mini Program.

If there is any other Personal Information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please complete the request form [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

You may request that we erase the Personal Information we hold about you where:

* you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold your Personal Information;
* we obtained your consent to process the Personal Information and you withdraw that consent (and we have no other valid legal grounds for processing the Personal Information);
* you believe we are unlawfully processing your Personal Information; or
* you are or were under the age of 13 (or such applicable age of majority under relevant local laws) when we collected the Personal Information and we can verify this.

You may exercise your right to restrict our processing your Personal Information (as described below) whilst we consider a request to erase your data.

We may retain the Personal Information if there are valid legal grounds for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims, freedom of expression or some other legal obligation) but we will let you know if that is the case.

Where you have requested that we erase your Personal Information that we have made public and there are valid legal grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can erase it too.

**Restriction of Processing to Storage Only**

**This section also applies to users resident in Russia.**

You have a right to require us to stop processing your Personal Information other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. However, we may process it if there are other valid legal grounds for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another's protection).

Where we agree to stop processing the Personal Information, we will use reasonable steps to inform any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can stop processing it too.

You may request we stop processing and just store the Personal Information we hold about you where:

* you believe the Personal Information is not accurate (for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate);
* we wish to erase the Personal Information as the processing is now unlawful (but you want us to retain the Personal Information and just store it instead); or
* we wish to erase the Personal Information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes (but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims).

**Portability**

You have the right to receive a copy of certain of your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. This comprises any Personal Information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., Shared Information and content saved to Favorites) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., profile data), as described in the section [**"How do we use your information?"**](#pp_how). You can exercise your right to export your data by following the instructions [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter).

You also have the right to request that we transfer that Personal Information to another party. If you wish for us to transfer the Personal Information to a third party, please ensure you provide details of such party. Note that we can only make such transfers where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the Personal Information or its processing once received by the third party.

**Objection**

**This section also applies to users resident in Russia.**

You may object to our use of your Personal Information that we use on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., when we use your Personal Information to ensure account security). If you object to such processing, please complete this [request form](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=help_center/index_vue#/rights-request).

To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us by following the instructions set out [here](https://help.wechat.com/cgi-bin/micromsg-bin/oshelpcenter?opcode=2&lang=en&plat=ios&id=180323e2Ermm180323yqauAZ&Channel=helpcenter).
