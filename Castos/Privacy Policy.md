Privacy
=======

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

**What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?**

 When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your email address or other details to help you with your experience.

**When do we collect information?**

We collect information from you when you subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey or enter information on our site.

When you visit or log in to our website, cookies and similar technologies may be used by our online data partners or vendors to associate these activities with other personal information they or others have about you, including by association with your email or home address. We may then send communications and marketing to these email addresses.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Castos collects aggregated, anonymous statistics in order to provide listener data for our customers. We log information about each download of an episode including data like IP addresses and user-agents. We then display this information on a podcast episode level to our customers in the form of Castos Analytics.

IP addresses are all hashed as they are stored in our system so none of this data is personally identifiable.  Castos never stores directly the IP address of podcast listeners, but rather a hashed version of IP addresses which is generalized to a State or City level.

**How do we use your information?**

We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:

**•** To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.

**•** To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.

**How do we protect visitor information?**

Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.

#### Security

Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

Customers utilizing our Republishing feature to distribute their podcast content in video form to YouTube will be subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) and YouTube’s [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms). Castos’ YouTube Republishing feature utilizes the YouTube API to distribute podcast episodes directly to Customers’ YouTube channels.
