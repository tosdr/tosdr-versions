Terms of Service
================

Last updated: October 25, 2023

This service is operated by Castos, Inc (“Castos”, “us”, “we”, or “our”).   Castos permits access and use of the Castos platform, including the website at https://castos.com website (collectively, the “Service”), subject to the terms and conditions in these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Terms and Conditions”). These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.  Castos may, at its discretion, update these Terms at any time. You can access and review the most current version of these Terms at the URL for this page or by clicking on the “Terms” link within the Service or as otherwise made available by Castos.

PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY REGISTERING FOR AN ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY UPDATES OR REVISIONS POSTED HERE OR OTHERWISE COMMUNICATED TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.

You represent and warrant that you: (a) are of legal age to form a binding contract; (b) have the right, authority, and capacity to agree to and abide by these Terms; and (c) are not a person barred from using the Services under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction. THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USERS UNDER THE AGE OF 18, AND SUCH USERS ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL DATA OR USING ANY ASPECT OF THE SERVICES, AND BY TAKING SUCH ACTIONS YOU AGREE, REPRESENT, AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER.

**Communications**

By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.

**Purchases**

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.

The Service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. 

**Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies**

We are continuously updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other websites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.

We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

**Subscriptions**

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Castos cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through your online account management page.

A valid payment method (“Authorized Payment Method”), including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Castos with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting an Authorized Payment Method, you automatically authorize Castos to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Castos may issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

**Trial Period**

We may offer a promotional fee or discounted trial period (“Trial Period”) anytime. To activate the Trial Period, you must (i) subscribe to the eligible plan of your choice; and (ii) provide an Authorized Payment Method at enrollment. Upon the expiration of the Trial Period, we will charge your Authorized Payment Method the full price of the applicable plan starting on the day the Trial Period ends unless you have canceled before the expiration of the Trial Period. You will then be charged monthly or annually, as applicable, at the then-current rate for your selected plan until you cancel or change to a different one. Before the expiration of the Trial Period, we will notify you of the upcoming end of your Trial Period by email to your Primary Email Address. If the Authorized Payment Method we have on file for you is declined, you must provide us with a new, valid Authorized Payment Method, or we reserve the right, without further notice, to immediately suspend or cancel your Account and your continued use of the Platform. 

**Upgrades or Downgrades**

‍Any change (including any upgrade, downgrade, or other modification) to any plan by you in a Trial Period will end the trial immediately.  Upon upgrading, you will immediately be billed for your first term period (i.e., the first annual or monthly period). Your Authorized Payment Method will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle for any upgrade or downgrade in plan level after any trial period. You will be billed immediately for the prorated difference for the current billing cycle for any upgrade to any higher-priced plan during that billing cycle. If a plan downgrade causes a credit to your Account, this credit will be used toward your next billing cycle(s). This credit will not be refunded.

**Fee Changes**

Castos, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Castos will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

If you upgrade from a free trial to any paid Plan, we will immediately bill you for the applicable Subscription Fees. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.

**Refunds**

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Castos on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Castos. Specifically, refunds may be given in the event of a material or security breach, or if Castos no longer fuflills their role as a hosting and distribution platform.

**Content**

Our Service allows you to upload, post, link, store, share, transmit and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material (“Content”). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.  This means that you, and not Castos, are entirely responsible for all Content, and other users of the Service, and not Castos, are similarly responsible for all Content.

By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity, and (iii) any factual information presented in your Content is accurate and complete in all material respects. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to (x) be infringing or violating any privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity, (y) violate these Terms or (z) be deemed objectionable by us.

You acknowledge and agree that Castos has no obligation to pre-screen Content, although Castos reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any Content.

Castos has the right but not the obligation to monitor all Content provided by users.

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service. In the event of any conflict between or among these Terms and any end user license agreement, privacy policy or usage guidelines to which these Terms refers, the terms and conditions of these Terms shall take precedence and govern.  

**California Users & Residents**

In accordance with California Civil Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting such unit in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

**General Provisions**

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. Notifications of change in these Terms will be provided by email to all users of the Service.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. For the purposes of these Terms, the words “such as,” “include,” “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” You may not assign or delegate any right or obligation under these Terms without the prior written consent of Castos. The failure of Castos to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of these Terms. Any prevention of or delay in performance by Castos hereunder due to labor disputes, acts of god, failure of the Internet, governmental restrictions, enemy or hostile governmental action, fire or other casualty or other causes beyond its reasonable control shall excuse the performance of its obligations for a period equal to the duration of any such prevention or delay.
