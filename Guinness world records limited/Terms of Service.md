If you use multiple logins for the purpose of disrupting a community or annoying other users you may have action taken against all of your accounts. 

All accounts must be registered with a valid personal email address that you access regularly so that moderation emails can be sent to you. Accounts registered with someone else’s email address, or with temporary email addresses may be closed without notice. We may require users to re-validate their account if we believe they have been using an invalid email address. 

GWR reserves the right to close accounts if any user is seen to be using proxy IPs (Internet Protocol addresses) in order to attempt to hide the use of multiple GWR accounts, or disrupts any of our services in any way. 

You may not submit or share any defamatory or illegal material of any nature in the Site’s communities. This includes text, graphics, video, programs or audio. Contributing material to the Site’s community with the intention of committing or promoting an illegal act is strictly prohibited. You agree to submit to or share with the Site’s communities only contributions which are your own original work.

If you fail to abide by these Community Rules (and/ or any variations in relevant local house rules) when taking part in the Site’s community, you will be sent an email which informs you why your contribution has been refused or edited. This email will also include a warning that continuing to break the rules may result in action being taken against your account or accounts. 

This action may include any User Content posted by you being checked before allowed to go on the Site or a temporary or permanent suspension of your ability to participate in any or all of the Site’s community areas. 

If you submit or share offensive or inappropriate content to or with any of the Site’s communities or anywhere else on the Site or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the Site, and GWR considers such behaviour to be serious and/ or repeated, GWR may use whatever information that is available to it about you to stop any further such infringements. This may include informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school or email provider about the infringement(s). 

GWR reserves the right to delete any contribution, or take action against any GWR account, at any time, for any reason.

However, in the event no such similar terms are available then the applicable terms shall be severed and deleted from these terms and the remaining terms shall survive and continue to be binding and enforceable. 

The failure or delay of GWR to exercise or enforce any right in these terms does not waive GWR’s right to enforce that right.
