However, we may also use your Personal Data for other purposes which are not incompatible with the purposes we have communicated to you (such as processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes) and provided that they are permitted by applicable data protection law.

4\. How we protect your privacy
-------------------------------

4.1 In accordance with this Policy, we will process Personal Data as follows:

* **Loyalty:** We will process Personal Data fairly. This means that we are transparent about how we process Personal Data and will process it in accordance with applicable law.
    
* **Purpose limitation:** We will process Personal Data for specified and lawful purposes and will not process it in a manner that is inconsistent with those purposes.
    
* **Proportionality:** We will process Personal Data in a manner proportionate to the purposes for which the processing is intended.
    
* **Accuracy of data:** We take appropriate measures to ensure that the Personal Data we hold is accurate, complete and, if necessary, kept up to date. However, it is also your responsibility to ensure that your Personal Data is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as possible by promptly notifying Tricount of any changes or errors.
    
* **Data security:** We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data that we collect and process concerning you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data. We have, directly or indirectly through our service providers, use of the following security measures: securing system access, prevention, detection and action measures against physical hazards (such as fire), backup systems, network security, logical access protection, list of authorized personnel and authentication system.
    
* **Data processors:** We may engage third parties to process Personal Data. for and on behalf of Tricount. We require these data processors to process the Personal Data and act strictly in accordance with our instructions and to take appropriate measures to ensure that Personal Data remains protected.
    
* **International data transfers:** Your Personal Data may be transferred and processed in countries other than the country in which you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your own country (and in some cases may not be as protective).  
    However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to demand that your Personal Data remain protected in accordance with this Policy. They include the implementation of a data transfer agreement based on the Standard Contractual Clauses of the European Commission for the transfer of Personal Data with the third parties we engage to provide our services, which require all parties involved in the service provided by Tricount to protect the Personal Data they process from the EEA in compliance with European Union data protection law.  
    Our data transfer agreement can be provided upon request. We have put in place similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and our partners and other details may be provided upon request.
    
* **Data retention:** We retain the Personal Data we collect from you for as long as we have a legitimate business need (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  
    When we no longer have a legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we delete it or make it anonymous, or if this is not possible (for example, when your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), we store it securely and isolate it from any further processing until such time as deletion is possible.
    

5\. Your data protection rights
-------------------------------

5.1 You have the following data protection rights:

* If you wish to **access, correct** **or** **update** your Personal Data, you can do so at any time by contacting us via: privacy@tricount.com.
    
* With regard to the **deletion** of your Personal Data, you can also do this at any time by contacting us via: privacy@tricount.com. Please note that the data of the tricounts themselves (expenses, etc.) will not be deleted in this context. Indeed, since a tricount is an account sheet shared between several users, we must keep this data as it can still benefit other users. When requesting the deletion of your Personal Data, your identifiers within the tricounts in which you participate will be pseudonymised.
    
* In addition, in certain circumstances, **you can object to the processing** of your Personal Data, ask us **to restrict the processing** of your Personal Data or **request the portability** of your Personal Data. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us via: privacy@tricount.com.
    
* If we have collected and processed your Personal Data with your consent, you may **withdraw your consent** at any time. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legality of any processing we have carried out prior to such withdrawal and will not affect any processing of your Personal Data carried out on the basis of legal grounds other than consent.
    
* If you have any complaints or concerns about how we process your Personal Data, we will endeavor to address these concerns. If you believe that we have not sufficiently addressed your complaint or concern, you have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available at [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en).)
