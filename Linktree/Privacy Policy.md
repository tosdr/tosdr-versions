We connect your audience to wherever you are online, and make your content more discoverable and easier to manage.

The pages that Linktree Users are able to create using the Linktree Services are referred to in this Privacy Notice as “**User Profiles**“. User Profiles are accessible by the public.

We are headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and have offices in Sydney. For more information about Linktree, please see the “About” section of our Website at [https://linktr.ee/s/about/](https://linktr.ee/s/about/).

### How does this Privacy Notice apply to me?

This Privacy Notice only applies to personal information we collect as a controller from:

* visitors to our Platform (“**Platform Visitors**“);

When we talk about Linktree acting as a “controller”, we mean that Linktree determines the purpose and the means of the processing (i.e. we make decisions about how we will handle your personal information). Because of the nature of our services, we can also act as a “processor” on behalf of Linktree Users. This means that, when we are instructed by a Linktree User, we can facilitate processing of Profile Visitors’ and Subscribers’ personal information on behalf of that Linktree User (“**Processor Services**“). This Privacy Notice does not address Processor Services. If you are a Profile Visitor or Subscriber, and want to know how a Linktree User handles your personal information, please get in touch with the Linktree User directly and/or refer to any privacy notice on the relevant User Profile.

If you provide us with information about another person (if, for example, you are a representative of an individual), you must provide them with a copy of this Privacy Notice and let that other person know that we use their personal information in the ways set out in this Privacy Notice.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). As indicated above, we require certain personal information to enter into a contract with you as a Linktree User. Without your personal information, we will be unable to provide you with Linktree Services available to Linktree Users.

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to develop and improve the Linktree Services, to provide additional functionality, to ensure appropriate security or to implement sensitive content warnings and content moderation. We may have other legitimate interests, and if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “[Contact Us](https://linktr.ee/s/privacy/#ContactUs)” heading below.

A list of our current group companies is available [here](https://linktr.ee/s/privacy/#LinktreeGroupCompanies) and a list of our current service providers and partners is available [here](https://linktr.ee/s/privacy/#LinktreeServiceProvidersAndPartners).

* to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;

### Disclosure of personal information to other countries

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

Specifically, Linktree may transfer personal information to the United States and other countries in which we do business. Linktree may also subcontract certain activities and share your personal information with third parties located outside of Australia (which is where we are headquartered).

The countries in which these organisations are located will vary, but, in the course of our business operations, we generally disclose personal information to organisations located in Australia, or the United States. Such transfers are made in order to provide the Linktree Services and carry out the activities specified in this Privacy Notice.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable data protection laws. These include entering into data transfer agreements between our group companies and these can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request. No transfer of your personal information will take place to an organisation or another country unless we believe there to be adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information. For more details please see the “[How do we secure your personal information](https://linktr.ee/s/privacy/#HowDoWeSecureYourPersonalInformation)” section below.

### How do we use cookies and similar tracking technology?

We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and use personal information about you. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://linktr.ee/s/cookie-notice/).

### How long do we retain your personal information?

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice and in each case in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in respect of permitted or required retention periods and limitation periods relevant to legal action.

### How do we secure your personal information?

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

In addition we limit access to your personal information to employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need for access. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

### What are your rights in relation to personal information?
