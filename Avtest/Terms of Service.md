**1.2**  The Contractual Services shall be performed exclusively on the basis of these Terms and Conditions unless there is written deviating agreement between AV-TEST and Customer in individual cases. General Terms and Conditions of Customer shall not be accepted by AV-TEST even in the event that AV-TEST does not explicitly contradict.

**1.3**  These Terms and Conditions shall apply to all present and future business relationships between AV-TEST and Customer in as far as Customer is an entrepreneur as defined by Article 14 BGB \[Civil Code\].

**1.4**  The provision of services shall occur on the basis of a service agreement as defined by Articles 611 et-seq. BGB. Services provided under a works contract (Werkvertrag) shall not be subject of these Terms and Conditions or of the individual agreements concluded hereunder.

##### 2 Quotations, Orders, General Principles for the Provision of Services

**2.3**  Service deliverables arise from the quotations by AV-TEST and/or service descriptions as agreed with Customer on a case-by-case basis. Unless deviating or specific regulations have been agreed in the service description, AV-TEST shall owe service provisions according to standards customary in the industry and in compliance with the acknowledged state of technology.

**2.4**  AV-TEST shall be entitled to employ sub-contractors for the provision of services.

**2.5**  The parties shall inform each-other concerning all circumstances within their domain which might have implications for the provision of services by AV-TEST.

If these requirements are not fulfilled, delivery dates shall be extended appropriately.

**4.1**  Customer shall be obliged to support the services by AV-TEST in every phase by active and appropriate co-operation measures.

Customer is obliged to treat data marked thus by AV-TEST as Malware, to process it only in compliance with the necessary diligence and not to execute it. This shall apply particularly also for data which have been marked as Malware by AV-TEST, which, however are not recognized by current anti-virus software.

**4.6**  In as far as Customer provides AV-TEST with software for a comparative test with software of another supplier, Customer shall assure that the software made available to AV-TEST is an identical version of software as the one sold by Customer in the course of ordinary business dealings under the same label.

**4.8**  In as far as AV-TEST is prevented to provide the Contractual Services by non-contractual provision of co-operation, AV-TEST shall not be responsible for any resulting deficits pertaining to the Contractual Services.

In this case AV-TEST shall notify Customer of the discontinuation of further Contractual Services with fourteen (14) days' notice.
