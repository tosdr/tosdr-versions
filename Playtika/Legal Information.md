Playtika does not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals on any of the platforms that run our Services.

Please note that you may still receive advertisements from Playtika and third parties within Playtika’s games even if you opt out of tailored advertising; but these ads will not be tailored to you.

De esta forma, garantizamos que todos los jugadores tengan una experiencia agradable y óptima.

#### ¿Cómo compartimos información?

Para ofrecerte nuestros Servicios, podemos compartir tu información en el ámbito de Playtika o con nuestros proveedores de servicios y socios comerciales para fines analíticos, de marketing y otros fines comerciales.

[**Más información +**](#INFORMACION_DISPONIBLE)

#### Información disponible para otros usuarios

Al usar nuestros Servicios cuando contribuyas o accedas a salas de chat, blogs, foros de mensajes, perfiles de jugadores o funcionalidades similares, podrás optar por revelar tu información. Algunas de estas funciones también pueden incluir la integración con sitios o servicios de terceros para permitirte la comunicación con otros jugadores (como por mensaje privado o correo electrónico).

Toda la información que proporciones a través de estas funciones, incluidas fotos y videos, puede ser accedida, leída, vista, recopilada y utilizada por Playtika y los usuarios de Playtika.

Algunas funciones sociales que están disponibles cuando juegas, te registras o inicias sesión a través de una cuenta de redes sociales pueden compartir detalles de tu actividad en Playtika, como el nivel de juego, el nombre y la foto de perfil con tus contactos o amigos de la cuenta de redes sociales. De manera similar, si utilizas nuestro Servicio en respuesta a una invitación de otro jugador a través de las redes sociales, dicho jugador podrá ver información sobre ti y tu nivel de juego, como cuándo te incorporas, y los niveles que has alcanzado.

En muchos de los juegos de Playtika, otros jugadores del juego podrán ver detalles sobre tu juego, comunicarse contigo y acceder a tu perfil de usuario y a la información que está disponible en él. Si decides integrar cualquiera de tus cuentas de redes sociales o canales de comunicación de Playtika, otros jugadores podrán enviarte solicitudes de juego o solicitudes de cuentas de redes sociales.

En caso de que Playtika intente realizar o se someta a una reestructuración de cualquier tipo, incluida la venta, compra, fusión o adquisición por parte de otra empresa, de cualquier activo de Playtika, podemos divulgar la información relevante que tengamos a las demás organizaciones involucradas en la transición. En caso de que ocurra así, haremos todos los esfuerzos razonables para informarte y para aclararte cómo afectará a tu información en la medida requerida por la ley.

#### Publicidad y análisis de mercado

También podemos publicar información global y analítica (información sobre ti y otros jugadores en conjunto, que no tiene como objetivo identificar específicamente a ningún jugador individual, por ejemplo, jugadores entre 25 y 50 años que viven en EE. UU.) y otra información anónima sobre nuestros jugadores. El objetivo de esta publicación es permitir el análisis de la industria, la elaboración de perfiles demográficos, el marketing, el análisis, la publicidad y otros fines comerciales.

Podemos compartir información para cumplir con nuestras obligaciones legales y para el cumplimiento normativo.

A continuación, se indican algunos ejemplos de cuándo podemos compartir información:

* Para cumplir con cualquier ley, reglamento o código de conducta obligatorio que exija detallar la información que recopilamos;

Registramos si has dado tu consentimiento para recibir comunicaciones promocionales y de marketing de nuestra parte. Si has dado tu consentimiento para recibir comunicaciones de marketing de nuestra parte por correo electrónico o mensajes de texto, por ejemplo, utilizaremos la información que hayamos recopilado sobre ti y sobre tus intereses, así como tu información de contacto, para enviarte nuestros materiales de marketing por correo electrónico. Estos materiales de marketing también podrán ser enviados a través de nuestras aplicaciones o notificaciones dentro del juego.

[**Más información +**](#PUBLICIDAD_DETALLES)

#### Publicidad

Nuestros socios publicitarios podrán recopilar (o podremos compartir con ellos) los siguientes tipos de información, a fin de contribuir a la funcionalidad y la personalización de los anuncios visibles en nuestro Servicio, y para ejecutar, medir y optimizar nuestras propias campañas de marketing y realizar análisis de rendimiento:

* Información sobre el rendimiento de los anuncios (como la cantidad de clics en un anuncio);
* Información global o anonimizada sobre los jugadores destinada a ayudar a orientar los anuncios, pero no a identificar directamente a las personas (por ejemplo, que un jugador tiene entre 45 y 65 años y vive en Miami);
* Información técnica sobre el dispositivo utilizado, como direcciones IP, IDFA, GAID y otros identificadores del dispositivo;
* Actividad de juego y eventos del juego, como su nivel dentro de un juego y las compras realizadas; y
* Tus identificadores de redes sociales.

Parte de la información podrá ser recopilada a través de cookies y otras tecnologías de seguimiento. Nuestros anunciantes pueden utilizar múltiples formas de tecnología de seguimiento al mismo tiempo.

Si haces clic en un anuncio, es posible que seas redirigido a una aplicación o sitio web de terceros, que puede no estar alojado en un sitio o aplicación propiedad de Playtika u operado por ella.

Si deseas dejar de recibir comunicaciones promocionales o de marketing de Playtika, podrás hacerlo de las siguientes maneras:

Si deseas dejar de recibir notificaciones push de Playtika, podrás hacerlo de las siguientes maneras:

* Cambia la configuración dentro de tus plataformas de redes sociales para desactivar las notificaciones de Playtika a través de estas plataformas. Por ejemplo, desactivando las notificaciones de Playtika en Facebook;
* Cambia la configuración en tu dispositivo o navegador para desactivar las notificaciones push de nuestro Servicio. En algunas de nuestras aplicaciones, también existe la opción de desactivar las notificaciones push en la configuración del juego.

#### Darte de baja de la publicidad personalizada

Dependiendo de dónde vivas y de dónde accedas a nuestros servicios, puedes tener derecho a darte de baja de la publicidad personalizada de terceros. Si deseas dejar de recibir publicidad personalizada de terceros, en la configuración de nuestras aplicaciones existe una opción que te permitirá desactivar estos anuncios en cualquier momento.

También podrás dejar de recibir publicidad personalizada ajustando la configuración de seguimiento de publicidad en tu(s) dispositivo(s). Para ello, resetea el identificador de publicidad en tu dispositivo (como el IDFA) o descarga una aplicación, como la aplicación «AppChoices» de Digital Advertising Alliance, que puede ayudarte a controlar la recopilación y el uso de información entre aplicaciones para publicidad personalizada.

Las herramientas de exclusión voluntaria de terceros, como la aplicación AppChoices, son operadas y propiedad de fuentes independientes. Playtika no controla, opera ni respalda estas herramientas ni las opciones ofrecidas por los anunciantes y por terceros a través de estas herramientas. Aquí solo se enumeran para conveniencia de los jugadores.

Playtika actualmente no responde a las señales de «No rastrear» en ninguna de las plataformas que ejecutan nuestros Servicios.

Ten en cuenta que es posible que aún recibas anuncios de Playtika y de terceros dentro de los juegos de Playtika incluso si te das de baja de la publicidad personalizada; sin embargo, estos anuncios ya no estarán personalizados.

[**Más información +**](#MENORES_DETALLES)

#### ¿Qué edad debo tener para jugar?

Las [Condiciones de servicio](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) de Playtika restringen el uso de algunos de nuestros juegos a usuarios menores de cierta edad (dependiendo del juego que juegues y la ley del lugar donde residas). En algunos juegos, podemos restringir la recopilación de información sobre los Servicios de cualquier persona, aplicar una restricción de edad que permita a los menores usar los Servicios mientras limita la recopilación de información sobre los Servicios de los menores, o requerir el permiso de un padre o tutor para recopilar información de los menores.

Te recomendamos revisar nuestras [Condiciones de servicio](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) para obtener más detalles sobre las pautas de edad y restricciones de nuestro Servicio.

#### ¿Qué es una restricción de edad y cómo funciona?

Una restricción de edad es un sistema que se puede utilizar para evitar que usuarios menores de cierta edad accedan a aplicaciones y sitios web, o para garantizar que diferentes grupos de edad obtengan una experiencia adecuada.

Si juegas a un juego con una restricción de edad, aparecerá una ventana emergente que te pedirá que proporciones información sobre tu edad. Esta información solo se utilizará para verificar que tienes la edad suficiente para jugar.

#### Mi hijo utiliza un juego de Playtika

Playtika se compromete a cumplir con las leyes que protegen a los menores. Si crees que tu hijo ha enviado algún dato a Playtika o que está jugando un juego de Playtika incumpliendo nuestras condiciones de servicio o sin tu consentimiento, ponte en contacto con nosotros a través de [\[email protected\]](https://www.playtika.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Tomaremos las medidas razonables para eliminar dicha información lo antes posible.

Wenn Sie über eine Plattform eines Drittanbieters spielen, z. B. über eine Social Media-Plattform, kann es sein, dass Sie durch Klicken auf eine Anzeige zu einer Drittanbieter-Plattform weitergeleitet werden, die nicht mehr vom Social Media-Anbieter oder von Playtika gehostet wird._

#### ABMELDEN VON AUF SIE ZUGESCHNITTENER WERBUNG

_

Je nachdem, wo Sie leben und von wo aus Sie auf unsere Dienste zugreifen, haben Sie möglicherweise das Recht, maßgeschneiderte Werbung von Drittanbietern abzulehnen. Wenn Sie in solchen Fällen maßgeschneiderte Werbung von Drittanbietern ablehnen möchten, haben Sie in den Einstellungen unserer Apps jederzeit die Möglichkeit, diese Werbung über einen Schieberegler zu deaktivieren.

Sie können sich auch gegen maßgeschneiderte Werbung entscheiden, indem Sie die Einstellungen für die Werbeverfolgung auf Ihrem Gerät bzw. Ihrem Gerät/Ihren Geräten anpassen. Sie können dies tun, indem Sie die Werbe-ID auf Ihrem Gerät zurücksetzen (z. B. die IDFA), oder Sie können Apps herunterladen, z. B. die „AppChoices“-App der digitalen Werbeallianz, die Ihnen helfen können, die Erfassung und Verwendung von app-übergreifenden Informationen für maßgeschneiderte Werbung zu kontrollieren.

Opt-out-Tools von Drittanbietern, wie z. B. AppChoices, werden unabhängig betrieben und befinden sich in unabhängigem Besitz. Playtika kontrolliert, betreibt oder fördert diese Tools oder die Auswahlmöglichkeiten, die Werbetreibende und andere über diese Tools anbieten, nicht. Sie werden hier nur der Einfachheit halber für die Spieler aufgeführt.

Playtika reagiert derzeit auf keiner der Plattformen, auf denen unsere Dienste laufen, auf „Do Not Track“-Signale.

Bitte beachten Sie, dass Sie in den Playtika-Spielen möglicherweise noch immer Werbung von Playtika und Drittanbietern erhalten, auch wenn Sie sich gegen maßgeschneiderte Werbung entscheiden. Diese Anzeigen werden jedoch nicht auf Sie zugeschnitten sein.

Eine Altersbeschränkung ist ein System, das eingerichtet werden kann, um Nutzern unter einem bestimmten Alter den Zugriff auf Apps und Websites zu verwehren oder um sicherzustellen, dass unterschiedliche Altersgruppen ein angemessenes Erlebnis erhalten.

Wenn Sie ein Spiel mit einer Altersbeschränkung spielen, wird ein Popup-Fenster angezeigt, in dem Sie aufgefordert werden, Angaben zu Ihrem Alter zu machen. Diese Informationen werden nur verwendet, um zu überprüfen, ob Sie alt genug sind, um das Spiel zu spielen.

_Playtika не продает и не передает в целях межконтекстной поведенческой рекламы информацию о потребителях младше 16 лет. Наша компания может обезличивать информацию для аналитических и рекламных целей, и в этом случае не пытается повторно идентифицировать информацию._

_**Уведомление о финансовых поощрениях.** Наша компания предлагает поощрения в виде программы вознаграждений, которая предоставляет определенные привилегии, например, награды и эксклюзивные предложения, а также другие программы, например, лотереи или конкурсы. Для целей этих программ мы можем собирать ваше имя и фамилию, а также контактную информацию и информацию об использовании вами услуг. Наша компания может раскрывать, продавать или передавать эту информацию в соответствии с представленной выше процедурой. Эти поощрения или программы могут считаться «финансовым стимулом» или «добросовестной программой лояльности» в соответствии с законами о конфиденциальности штатов США._

_Если по закону от нашей компании требуется определить стоимость информации, полученной через такие программы, мы оцениваем собранные и использованные данные на основе ценности предоставления будущих предложений, ориентированных на ваши интересы, стоимость которых может зависеть от категорий собранной информации и предлагаемого или рекламируемого продукта._

_Участие в любой стимулирующей программе является добровольным, и, подписываясь на нее, вы соглашаетесь на сбор, использование и раскрытие вашей информации в связи с программой. Если вы позже захотите отозвать свое согласие, вы можете сделать это, связавшись с нами или следуя инструкциям, указанным в условиях участия конкретной программы, если это применимо._

_Обратите внимание, что, если вы решите отказаться от продажи или передачи вашей информации, а также от использования ваших данных для таргетированной рекламы, это не повлияет на ваше участие в наших программах, и вы продолжите получать все полагающиеся вам преимущества. Однако наша компания не сможет предоставлять вам какие-либо преимущества программы, если вы подадите запрос на удаление всей вашей информации, так как у нас не будет возможности сопоставить вас с полагающимися вам привилегиями или связаться с вами по поводу их получения._

_

Наша компания может использовать технологии, которые (a) могут считаться автоматизированным принятием решений или профилированием; и (или) (b) включают обработку информации в рамках обучения, тестирования и использования искусственного интеллекта (технологии, имитирующей разумное поведение человека) для оценки собираемой информации (например, внутриигровой активности и коммуникаций в рамках наших услуг) с целью совершенствования наших услуг. Например, для упрощения процессов поддержки клиентов, проведения опросов, адаптации услуг нашей компании в соответствии с вашими предпочтениями, а также других законных деловых целей.

En fonction de l’endroit où vous vivez et accédez à nos services, vous pouvez avoir le droit de refuser de recevoir des publicités personnalisées de la part de tiers. Dans ce cas, si vous souhaitez refuser les publicités personnalisées de tiers, nous fournissons un bouton dans les paramètres de nos applications qui vous permet de désactiver ces publicités à tout moment.

Vous pouvez également refuser les publicités personnalisées en ajustant les paramètres de suivi publicitaire sur votre/vos appareil(s). Pour cela, vous pouvez réinitialiser l’identifiant publicitaire sur votre appareil (p. ex. l’IDFA) ou télécharger des applications, comme l’application « AppChoices » de Digital Advertising Alliance, qui peuvent vous aider à contrôler le recueil et l’utilisation d’informations entre les applications à des fins de publicité personnalisée.

Les outils de désinscription de tiers, comme l’application AppChoices, sont exploités et détenus de manière indépendante. Playtika ne contrôle, ni n’exploite, ni ne soutient ces outils ou les choix que les annonceurs et autres proposent par le biais de ces outils. Ils ne sont répertoriés ici que pour des raisons de commodité pour les joueurs.

Actuellement, Playtika ne répond pas aux notifications « Do Not Track » (Ne pas suivre) et ce, sur aucune des plateformes qui exploitent nos Services.

Veuillez noter que vous pouvez toujours recevoir des publicités de Playtika et de tiers dans le cadre des jeux de Playtika même si vous refusez la publicité personnalisée ; toutefois ces publicités ne seront pas personnalisées.

Di seguito sono riportati ulteriori dettagli su alcuni di questi scopi.

Playtika raccoglierà e utilizzerà le informazioni dell’utente solo laddove la legge lo consenta. La raccolta e l’utilizzo delle informazioni da parte nostra hanno diverse basi legali, a seconda delle leggi applicabili all’utente in base al luogo in cui vive e utilizza i Servizi di Playtika. Le basi legali più comuni su cui ci basiamo per raccogliere e utilizzare le informazioni sono le seguenti:

**Gameplay**

Utilizziamo le informazioni per consentirci di ottimizzare e fornire i nostri giochi all’utente. Ciò include l’utilizzo di informazioni sul gameplay e sugli acquisti effettuati per personalizzare i nostri giochi in base alle esigenze dell’utente, che possono essere sotto forma di regali, promozioni e funzioni all’interno del gioco. Utilizziamo questi parametri poiché riteniamo che svolgano un ruolo significativo nel determinare, ad esempio, il livello di coinvolgimento dell’utente con i nostri giochi. Inoltre, utilizziamo le informazioni dell’utente in forma aggregata con altri utenti con background o gameplay simili. In questo modo garantiamo a tutti i giocatori un’esperienza piacevole e ottimale.

Inoltre, utilizziamo le informazioni sul gameplay per monitorare i progressi dell’utente e possiamo condividerle con terze parti in modo da poter fornire all’utente premi e incentivi pertinenti e interessanti per l’utente e per il suo gameplay.

**Assistenza clienti e community management**

Possiamo utilizzare le informazioni per fornire assistenza direttamente all’utente o per fornire un supporto più generale su tutto il Servizio, ad esempio per correggere i bug. Quando l’utente fornisce informazioni tramite un ticket di assistenza, il nostro team di assistenza utilizzerà tali informazioni per fornire assistenza all’utente.

Possiamo inoltre utilizzare le informazioni sull’account dell’utente per migliorare la sua esperienza con Playtika, inclusa l’assegnazione di un account manager. Gli account manager possono utilizzare le informazioni fornite dall’utente per facilitare la gestione aziendale, tra cui raccogliere il feedback dell’utente sui giochi Playtika, sulle nuove funzioni e sulla sua esperienza di gioco. Queste informazioni possono essere utilizzate anche per invitare l’utente a partecipare a Eventi.

**Funzioni social e chat**

Alcuni dei nostri giochi sono dotati di funzioni social e chat. Possiamo elaborare informazioni per abilitare queste funzioni e consentire all’utente di contattare familiari e amici. Alcune delle informazioni che raccogliamo o elaboriamo possono essere fornite da piattaforme di terze parti, come Facebook. Per ulteriori informazioni sulla condivisione delle informazioni dei social media, consultare le impostazioni del proprio profilo di social media e consultare l’informativa sulla privacy della piattaforma.

**Annunci pubblicitari**

Possiamo utilizzare le informazioni per facilitare l’integrazione di annunci pubblicitari con i nostri giochi contenenti annunci. Possiamo anche condividere le informazioni dell’utente con terze parti, come i nostri partner pubblicitari, per fornire assistenza nella funzionalità e nel targeting degli annunci pubblicitari. Ulteriori dettagli sulle modalità di utilizzo delle informazioni dell’utente per gli annunci pubblicitari sono disponibili nella sezione Annunci pubblicitari e marketing della presente Informativa.

Compiremo ogni ragionevole sforzo per informare l’utente di tale eventualità e in che modo essa incide sulle proprie informazioni nella misura richiesta dalla legge.

_

#### PUBBLICITÀ E ANALISI DI MERCATO

_

Possiamo anche pubblicare informazioni aggregate e analitiche (informazioni collettive sull’utente e altri giocatori non destinate a identificare specificamente un singolo giocatore, ad esempio giocatori di età compresa tra 25 e 50 anni che vivono negli Stati Uniti) e altre informazioni anonime sui nostri giocatori, al fine di consentire l’analisi del settore, la profilazione demografica, il marketing, l’analisi, gli annunci pubblicitari e altri scopi aziendali.

_

#### OBBLIGHI LEGALI E CONFORMITÀ

 _Possiamo condividere le informazioni per soddisfare i nostri obblighi legali e adempiere all’applicazione della legge._

_Esempi di casi in cui possiamo condividere informazioni includono:_

* _nel caso in cui decidiamo di divulgare informazioni in buona fede in risposta a richieste legittime da parte di autorità pubbliche, anche per soddisfare i requisiti di sicurezza nazionale o di applicazione della legge, o a un processo legale (ad esempio, un’ordinanza del tribunale, un mandato di perquisizione o un mandato di comparizione);_
* _per soddisfare leggi, normative o codici di condotta obbligatori che richiedono la divulgazione dei dettagli sulle informazioni raccolte;_
* _laddove abbiamo motivo di credere che il nostro Servizio venga utilizzato per commettere un reato, possiamo condividere le informazioni dell’utente al fine di segnalare e indagare sull’attività criminale sospetta oppure condividere ulteriori dettagli con altre società e organizzazioni per la prevenzione, la segnalazione o l’indagine di sospette attività criminali. Ciò può includere anche sforzi per prevenire le frodi, per contribuire alla riduzione del rischio creditizio e altre precauzioni di sicurezza. Tale divulgazione sarà a nostra esclusiva discrezione;_
* _nel caso in cui abbiamo motivo di credere che ci sia un’emergenza rappresentante una minaccia per la salute e/o la sicurezza di qualsiasi persona, compresi i nostri utenti, dipendenti o il pubblico in generale. Tale divulgazione sarà a nostra esclusiva discrezione;_
* _per proteggere i diritti o la proprietà di Playtika e di altre terze parti, inclusa l’applicazione dei nostri [Termini di Servizio](https://playtika.com/terms-service)._

#### ANNUNCI PUBBLICITARI E MARKETING

Possiamo utilizzare e condividere con i nostri fornitori di servizi e partner commerciali informazioni quali identificatori di dispositivi ed eventi di gioco per realizzare, valutare e ottimizzare le nostre campagne di marketing (ad esempio, mostrare annunci pubblicitari per i nostri Servizi su altri siti Web o app).

Inoltre, alcuni dei nostri Servizi includono annunci pubblicitari di terze parti. Questi inserzionisti possono raccogliere e condividere alcune informazioni, ad esempio i clic sull’annuncio, per facilitare la funzionalità e il targeting degli annunci.

Registriamo qualora l’utente abbia acconsentito a ricevere comunicazioni promozionali e di marketing da parte nostra. Qualora l’utente abbia acconsentito a ricevere comunicazioni di marketing tramite e-mail o SMS, ad esempio, utilizzeremo le informazioni raccolte sull’utente e sui suoi interessi, nonché le sue informazioni di contatto per inviare il nostro materiale promozionale. Alcuni di questi materiali promozionali possono anche essere distribuiti tramite le nostre app o notifiche di gioco.

[**Ulteriori informazioni +**](#Section14)

#### ANNUNCI PUBBLICITARI

_Al fine di personalizzare e facilitare la funzionalità degli annunci pubblicitari visualizzati sul nostro Servizio, nonché per eseguire, misurare e ottimizzare le nostre campagne di marketing ed effettuare analisi delle prestazioni, i nostri partner pubblicitari possono raccogliere (o noi possiamo condividere con loro) i seguenti tipi di informazioni:_

* _informazioni sulle prestazioni dell’annuncio (ad esempio, il numero di clic su un annuncio);_
* _informazioni aggregate/de-identificate sui giocatori destinate ad aiutare il targeting degli annunci pubblicitari, ma non a identificare direttamente gli individui (ad esempio, un giocatore ha un’età compresa tra i 45 e i 65 anni e vive a Miami);_
* _informazioni tecniche sul dispositivo utilizzato, quali indirizzi IP, IDFA, GAID e altri identificatori del dispositivo;_
* _gameplay ed eventi di gioco, quali il livello dell’utente all’interno di un gioco e gli acquisti effettuati; e_
* _identificatori di social media dell’utente._

_Alcune delle informazioni possono essere raccolte tramite cookie e altre tecnologie di tracciamento. I nostri inserzionisti possono utilizzare diverse forme di tecnologie di tracciamento contemporaneamente._

_Facendo clic su un annuncio pubblicitario, l’utente potrebbe essere reindirizzato a un’app o sito Web di terze parti, che potrebbe non essere ospitato su un sito o un’app di proprietà o gestita da Playtika. Nel caso in cui l’utente giochi tramite una piattaforma di terze parti, ad esempio tramite una piattaforma di social media, facendo clic su un annuncio può essere reindirizzato a una piattaforma di terze parti che non è più ospitata dal provider di social media o da Playtika._

#### DISATTIVAZIONE DI E-MAIL E NOTIFICHE PUSH

_Qualora l’utente desideri disattivare le comunicazioni promozionali o di marketing di Playtika, può farlo nei seguenti modi:_

* _facendo clic su “Annulla iscrizione” in un’e-mail promozionale da uno specifico Servizio di Playtika per modificare e aggiornare le preferenze di contatto per le e-mail inviate da noi (si noti che possiamo comunque contattare l’utente via e-mail in relazione al suo account, ad esempio per reimpostare la password o per altre attività di gestione dell’account);_

_Qualora l’utente desideri disattivare le notifiche push di Playtika, può farlo nei seguenti modi:_

* _modificando le impostazioni all’interno delle piattaforme di social media per disattivare le notifiche da Playtika tramite queste piattaforme, ad esempio, disattivando le notifiche da Playtika su Facebook; e_
* _modificando le impostazioni del dispositivo e/o del browser per disattivare le notifiche push dal nostro Servizio. In alcune delle nostre app esiste anche la possibilità di disattivare le notifiche push nelle impostazioni di gioco._

#### DISATTIVAZIONE DEGLI ANNUNCI PUBBLICITARI PERSONALIZZATI

_

A seconda del luogo in cui risiede e accede ai nostri Servizi, l’utente può avere dei diritti in relazione alla disattivazione degli annunci pubblicitari personalizzati di terze parti. In tal caso, qualora l’utente desideri disattivare gli annunci pubblicitari personalizzati di terze parti, è possibile farlo all’interno delle impostazioni delle nostre app in qualsiasi momento.

L’utente può inoltre scegliere di disattivare gli annunci pubblicitari personalizzati modificando le impostazioni di tracciamento pubblicitario sui propri dispositivi. A tal fine, è possibile ripristinare l’identificatore pubblicitario sul dispositivo dell’utente (come l’IDFA) oppure scaricare un’app, come “AppChoices” di Digital Advertising Alliance, in grado di aiutare l’utente a controllare la raccolta e l’utilizzo di informazioni tra app per annunci pubblicitari personalizzati.

Gli strumenti di opt-out di terze parti, come AppChoices, sono gestiti e posseduti in modo indipendente. Playtika non controlla, utilizza o approva tali strumenti o le scelte fornite dagli inserzionisti e da altri attraverso questi strumenti. Sono elencati qui solo per comodità dei giocatori.

Playtika al momento non risponde ai segnali “Do Not Track” su nessuna delle piattaforme che gestisce i nostri Servizi.

Si tenga presente che l’utente potrebbe comunque ricevere annunci pubblicitari da Playtika e da terze parti all’interno dei giochi di Playtika anche qualora decidesse di disattivare gli annunci personalizzati, ma non saranno personalizzati per l’utente.

#### MINORI

Ci impegniamo a rispettare le leggi sulla protezione dei minori. In alcuni dei nostri giochi effettuiamo una verifica dell’età per impedire ai minori di accedere ai nostri Servizi. Alcuni dei nostri giochi (tra cui Best Fiends e Best Fiends Stars) dispongono di versioni ad accesso limitato, aventi funzioni di gioco e di trattamento dei dati limitate, che mettiamo a disposizione quando i minori tentano di giocare o di creare un account.

[**Ulteriori informazioni +**](#Section24)

#### QUANTI ANNI BISOGNA AVERE PER GIOCARE?

_I [Termini di servizio](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) di Playtika limitano l’uso di alcuni dei nostri giochi da parte di utenti al di sotto di una certa età (a seconda del gioco e della legge vigente nel paese di residenza). In alcuni giochi, possiamo limitare la raccolta di informazioni sui Servizi da parte di chiunque, applicare una di verifica dell’età che consente ai minori di utilizzare i servizi limitando al contempo la raccolta di informazioni sui Servizi o richiedere l’autorizzazione di un genitore o tutore a raccogliere informazioni dai minori._

_Consigliamo di consultare i nostri [Termini di servizio](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) per ulteriori dettagli sulle linee guida e le restrizioni relative all’età sul nostro Servizio._

#### COS’È UNA VERIFICA DELL’ETÀ E COME FUNZIONA?

_

Una verifica dell’età è un sistema che può essere adottato per impedire agli utenti minori di una certa età di accedere ad app e siti Web o per garantire che gruppi di età diversi ottengano un’esperienza appropriata.

Quando l’utente gioca a un gioco con verifica dell’età, appare una finestra pop-up che chiede all’utente di fornire informazioni sulla propria. Queste informazioni vengono utilizzate solo per verificare che l’utente abbia l’età sufficiente per giocare.

_Playtika non vende né condivide, a fini di pubblicità comportamentale inter-contestuale, le informazioni dei consumatori di età inferiore ai 16 anni. Possiamo de-identificare le informazioni a fini analitici e pubblicitari, nel qual caso non tenteremo di re-identificare le informazioni._

_**Avviso di incentivo finanziario**. Offriamo incentivi quali un programma a premi, che offre alcuni vantaggi, come premi e offerte esclusive, nonché altri programmi come lotterie o concorsi. Ai fini di questi programmi, possiamo raccogliere il nome e le informazioni di contatto dell’utente, nonché informazioni sull’utilizzo dei Servizi da parte dell’utente. Possiamo divulgare, vendere o condividere queste informazioni come descritto sopra. Questi incentivi o programmi possono essere considerati un “incentivo finanziario” o un “programma fedeltà in buona fede” ai sensi delle leggi sulla privacy degli Stati Uniti._

_Laddove per legge ci venga richiesto di assegnare valore alle informazioni ottenute tramite tali programmi, valuteremo le informazioni raccolte e utilizzate in base al valore della condivisione di offerte future su misura di interesse per l’utente, il cui valore può dipendere dalle categorie di informazioni raccolte e dal prodotto offerto o promosso._

_La partecipazione a qualsiasi programma di incentivi è volontaria e, registrandosi, l’utente acconsente alla raccolta, all’utilizzo e alla divulgazione delle proprie informazioni in relazione al programma. Qualora in seguito l’utente desideri revocare il proprio consenso, è possibile farlo contattandoci o seguendo in altro modo le istruzioni indicate nei termini e condizioni del programma specifico, laddove applicabili._

_Qualora l’utente scelga di rinunciare alla vendita o alla condivisione delle proprie informazioni o all’utilizzo delle proprie informazioni per gli annunci pubblicitari mirati, la sua partecipazione ai nostri programmi non ne verrà influenzata e continuerà a ricevere tutti i vantaggi a cui ha diritto. Tuttavia, qualora l’utente richieda la cancellazione di tutte le sue informazioni, non saremo più in grado di fornire i vantaggi del programma, in quanto non avremo modo di collegare l’utente ai vantaggi a cui aveva diritto o di contattarlo in merito._

#### COOKIE E ALTRE TECNOLOGIE

Possiamo utilizzare cookie e altre tecnologie per raccogliere informazioni sull’utilizzo del Servizio e del sito Web da parte dell’utente, al fine di migliorare il Servizio e il targeting degli annunci pubblicitari.

Possiamo inoltre adottare tecnologie che includono l’intelligenza artificiale (“IA”) per altri scopi, ad esempio per fornire nuove funzioni o fornire assistenza in merito alla funzionalità del nostro Servizio.

#### COOKIE E TECNOLOGIE SIMILI

_Un cookie è un file di dati di piccole dimensioni che viene trasferito al dispositivo dell’utente a scopo di archiviazione. Le informazioni contenute in un cookie possono essere collegate a dati, come l’attività di navigazione dell’utente.

Hal ini dapat dilakukan dengan mereset pengenal iklan di perangkat Anda (seperti IDFA) atau Anda dapat mengunduh aplikasi, seperti aplikasi "AppChoices" dari Digital Advertising Alliance, yang dapat membantu Anda mengendalikan pengumpulan dan penggunaan informasi lintas aplikasi untuk iklan yang disesuaikan.

Alat penyisih pihak ketiga seperti aplikasi AppChoices dioperasikan dan dimiliki secara independen. Playtika tidak mengontrol, mengoperasikan, atau mendukung alat ini atau pilihan yang disediakan oleh pengiklan dan pihak lain melalui alat ini. Alat tersebut dicantumkan di sini hanya untuk kenyamanan pemain.

Playtika saat ini tidak menanggapi sinyal "Jangan Lacak" di platform mana pun yang menjalankan Layanan kami.

Harap diperhatikan bahwa Anda masih dapat menerima iklan dari Playtika dan pihak ketiga di dalam game Playtika meskipun Anda memilih untuk tidak menerima iklan yang disesuaikan; tetapi iklan ini tidak akan disesuaikan untuk Anda.

Hukum bervariasi dari satu yurisdiksi ke yurisdiksi lainnya, sehingga hukum perlindungan data dan privasi yang berlaku di tempat informasi ditransfer atau disimpan, digunakan, atau diproses, mungkin berbeda dari hukum yang berlaku di tempat Anda tinggal.

#### ANAK-ANAK

Kami berkomitmen untuk mematuhi undang-undang perlindungan anak. Pada beberapa game kami, kami menggunakan gerbang usia untuk mencegah anak-anak mengakses Layanan kami. Beberapa game kami (termasuk Best Fiends dan Best Fiends Stars) menggunakan gerbang usia dan memiliki versi akses terbatas yang kami sediakan saat anak-anak mencoba bermain atau membuat akun, yang memiliki fitur game dan pemrosesan data yang terbatas.

[**Info Lebih Lanjut +**](#Section24)

#### APA YANG DIMAKSUD DENGAN GERBANG USIA DAN BAGAIMANA CARA KERJANYA?

Gerbang usia adalah sistem yang dapat diterapkan untuk mencegah pengguna di bawah usia tertentu mengakses aplikasi dan situs web atau untuk memastikan kelompok usia yang berbeda mendapatkan pengalaman yang sesuai.

Jika Anda memainkan game dengan gerbang usia, sebuah pop up akan muncul meminta Anda untuk memberikan informasi tentang usia Anda. Informasi ini hanya digunakan untuk memverifikasi bahwa Anda sudah cukup umur untuk memainkan game tersebut.

#### OGŁOSZENIA REKLAMOWE

Aby wspomóc funkcjonalność i spersonalizować reklamy wyświetlane w ramach naszej Usługi, a także prowadzić, mierzyć i optymalizować nasze własne kampanie marketingowe oraz przeprowadzać analizy wydajności, nasi partnerzy reklamowi mogą zbierać (lub możemy im udostępniać) następujące rodzaje informacji:

* Informacje o efektywności reklam (takie jak liczba kliknięć w reklamę);

Jeśli użytkownik chce zrezygnować z powiadomień push od firmy Playtika, może to zrobić poprzez:

* Zmienienie ustawień na platformach mediów społecznościowych w celu wyłączenia powiadomień od firmy Playtika za pośrednictwem tych platform. Na przykład można tak zrobić wyłączając powiadomienia od firmy Playtika na Facebooku; oraz
* Zmianę ustawień urządzenia i/lub przeglądarki w celu wyłączenia powiadomień push z naszej Usługi. W niektórych naszych aplikacjach mamy również opcję wyłączenia powiadomień push w ustawieniach gry.

#### REZYGNACJA Z WYŚWIETLANIA SPERSONALIZOWANYCH REKLAM

W zależności od miejsca zamieszkania i miejsca, z którego użytkownik uzyskuje dostęp do naszych Usług, może mieć on prawo do rezygnacji z otrzymywania spersonalizowanych reklam stron trzecich. W takich przypadkach, jeśli użytkownik chce zrezygnować z wyświetlania spersonalizowanych reklam stron trzecich, w ustawieniach naszych aplikacji udostępniamy opcję umożliwiającą wyłączenie tych reklam w dowolnym momencie.

Użytkownik może również zrezygnować ze spersonalizowanych reklam, dostosowując ustawienia śledzenia reklam na swoim urządzeniu (urządzeniach). Można to zrobić poprzez zresetowanie identyfikatora reklamowego na urządzeniu (np. IDFA) lub można pobrać aplikacje, takie jak aplikacja „AppChoices" firmy Digital Advertising Alliance, które mogą pomóc w kontrolowaniu gromadzenia i wykorzystywania informacji między aplikacjami w celu spersonalizowania reklam.

Narzędzia stron trzecich umożliwiające rezygnację, takie jak aplikacja AppChoices, są niezależnie obsługiwane i stanowią ich własność. Firma Playtika nie kontroluje, nie obsługuje ani nie zatwierdza tych narzędzi ani wyborów dokonywanych przez reklamodawców i inne podmioty za pośrednictwem tych narzędzi. Narzędzia te zostały wymienione tutaj wyłącznie jako udogodnienie dla graczy.

Firma Playtika nie reaguje obecnie na sygnały „Nie śledź" na żadnej z platform obsługujących nasze Usługi.

Uwaga: użytkownik może nadal otrzymywać reklamy od firmy Playtika i stron trzecich w grach Playtika, nawet jeśli zrezygnuje ze spersonalizowanych reklam, ale reklamy te nie będą dopasowane do użytkownika.

#### PLIKI COOKIE I INNE TECHNOLOGIE

Możemy wykorzystywać pliki cookie i inne technologie do gromadzenia informacji o sposobie korzystania z naszej Usługi i strony internetowej, by ułatwić nam takie działania, jak ulepszanie naszej Usługi i ukierunkowanie naszych reklam.

[**Więcej informacji +**](#Section30)

#### PLIKI COOKIE I PODOBNE TECHNOLOGIE

Plik cookie to niewielki plik danych przesyłany do urządzenia użytkownika w celu zapisania danych. Informacje zawarte w pliku cookie mogą być powiązane z informacjami, takimi jak aktywność związana z przeglądaniem. Możemy umieszczać pliki cookie na urządzeniu użytkownika i wykorzystywać je do takich celów, jak poprawa jakości naszej Usługi, ułatwienie korzystania z naszej Usługi i udostępnianie ukierunkowanych reklam. Reklamodawcy i usługodawcy zewnętrzni mogą również wykorzystywać, umieszczać lub odczytywać pliki cookie lub inne technologie opisane poniżej na urządzeniu użytkownika, a praktyki te podlegają ich własnej polityce.

Występują dwa rodzaje plików cookie: niezbędne pliki cookie i nieistotne pliki cookie. Używamy niezbędnych plików cookie, aby odróżnić użytkownika od innych użytkowników naszej strony internetowej Playtika i prawidłowo obsługiwać tę stronę.

Użytkownik może zablokować wszystkie pliki cookie, w tym niezbędne pliki cookie, poprzez skonfigurowanie przeglądarki internetowej lub wykorzystanie wtyczek stron trzecich w celu wyświetlenia ostrzeżeń o próbach umieszczenia plików cookie na urządzeniu lub ograniczenia rodzaju plików cookie, na których umieszczanie użytkownik zezwala.

Na stronach internetowych firmy Playtika, które wykorzystują pliki cookie, można dostosować ustawienia plików cookie i zgody za pośrednictwem banera plików cookie podczas pierwszej wizyty na stronie internetowej lub kliknąć łącze „Ustawienia plików cookie" w stopce strony internetowej lub widżecie plików cookie, by zmienić swoje ustawienia w dowolnym momencie.

Uwaga: wyłączenie plików cookie może spowodować utratę niektórych funkcji i funkcjonalności naszej Usługi. Playtika nie reaguje obecnie na sygnały typu „Nie śledź", niezależnie od tego, czy sygnał ten jest odbierany na komputerze, czy na urządzeniu mobilnym.

Możemy również korzystać z innych podobnych technologii, w tym:

* sygnalizatory www, dzięki którym możemy wiedzieć, czy dana strona została odwiedzona lub czy wiadomość e-mail została otwarta;
* identyfikatory reklam, takie jak identyfikator reklamowy Android i Apple znane jako IDFA lub GAID, które są połączone z urządzeniem użytkownika i mogą zostać zresetowane na urządzeniu;
* piksele śledzące, dzięki którym my lub nasi partnerzy reklamowi możemy reklamować się sprawniej i skuteczniej, rozpoznając urządzenie(a) użytkownika w trybie włączonym, wyłączonym i w różnych usługach i urządzeniach oraz identyfikując źródło nowej instalacji; oraz
* lokalne obiekty współdzielone, znane również jako pliki cookie flash, które mogą pomóc nam ograniczyć oszustwa, zapamiętać preferencje użytkownika w grze i przyspieszyć czas ładowania.

#### SZTUCZNA INTELIGENCJA

Możemy korzystać z technologii, które (a) można uznać za zautomatyzowane podejmowanie decyzji lub profilowanie i/lub (b) obejmują przetwarzanie informacji w ramach szkolenia, testowania i wykorzystywania sztucznej inteligencji (technologii naśladującej inteligentne ludzkie zachowanie) w celu oceny zbieranych przez nas informacji (w tym na przykład aktywności w grze i komunikacji w ramach naszych Usług) w celu ulepszenia naszych Usług. Na przykład w celu ułatwienia procesów obsługi klienta, przeprowadzania ankiet, dostosowania naszych Usług do preferencji użytkownika oraz w realizacji innych uzasadnionych celów biznesowych.

#### PRAWA UŻYTKOWNIKA

W zależności od miejsca zamieszkania użytkownika i miejsca, z którego uzyskuje on dostęp do naszych Usług, mogą mu przysługiwać prawa w związku z przechowywanymi przez nas informacjami na jego temat i sposobem ich wykorzystywania. Użytkownik może egzekwować te prawa w dowolnym momencie, korzystając z informacji kontaktowych i metod podanych w sekcji „Kontakt z nami" poniżej.

[**Więcej informacji +**](#Section31)

Prawo w niektórych krajach przyznaje osobom fizycznym uprawnienia w odniesieniu do ich informacji. Prawa te i sposób egzekwowania ich w odniesieniu do Usług firmy Playtika wyjaśniono bardziej szczegółowo poniżej. **Uwaga: nie wszystkie kraje przyznają użytkownikowi takie same prawa w odniesieniu do jego informacji.

W zależności od miejsca zamieszkania, użytkownikom mogą przysługiwać następujące prawa:

* Dostęp
    * Użytkownik może mieć prawo do uzyskania informacji o tym, jakie informacje o nim przechowujemy i zażądania ich kopii.
    * Dodatkowo mieszkańcy stanu Kalifornia mają również prawo do zapoznania się z kategoriami informacji, które zebraliśmy na ich temat, kategoriami źródeł, z których zbierane są informacje, celami biznesowymi lub komercyjnymi zbierania, sprzedaży lub udostępniania informacji oraz kategoriami stron trzecich, którym firma ujawniła ich informacje.
* Skargi
    * Użytkownik może mieć prawo do złożenia skargi dotyczącej sposobu przetwarzania przez nas jego danych do właściwego organu w swojej jurysdykcji.

Odpowiemy na prośbę użytkownika zgodnie z wszelkimi terminami wymaganymi przez prawo. Firma Playtika nie będzie dyskryminować użytkownika za korzystanie z któregokolwiek z tych praw.

Zanim spełnimy żądanie użytkownika, możemy poprosić go o informacje, dokumenty lub inne dowody, aby potwierdzić jego tożsamość. Jeśli użytkownik nie będzie w stanie przekazać nam wymaganych dowodów, możemy nie być w stanie spełnić jego żądania. Działamy w ten sposób, aby zapobiec nieuczciwemu, złośliwemu lub w inny sposób niekorzystnemu ujawnieniu, usunięciu lub innym działaniom związanym z informacjami użytkownika. W niektórych jurysdykcjach użytkownik może wnioskować poprzez upoważnionego agenta działającego w jego imieniu. Możemy wymagać od agentów potwierdzenia, że działają w imieniu użytkownika.

W Stanach Zjednoczonych dostępne są różne sposoby złożenia wniosku o rezygnację z danej usługi. Szczegółowe informacje na ten temat można znaleźć w powyższej sekcji zatytułowanej „Rezygnacja ze spersonalizowanych reklam”. Ponadto, w zależności od stanu zamieszkania, użytkownik może mieć również prawo do wnioskowania o rezygnację za pośrednictwem sygnału globalnej kontroli prywatności (Global Privacy Control, „GPC”). Sygnał GPC jest uznawany tylko na poziomie urządzenia.

Playtika 目前不會在任何執行我們服務的平台回應「請勿追蹤」訊號。

請注意，即使您選擇退出客製化廣告，您仍可能在 Playtika 遊戲收到來自 Playtika 與第三方的廣告；但這些廣告不會為您客製化。

_यदि आप किसी विज्ञापन पर क्लिक करते(ती) हैं, तो आपको किसी तृतीय पक्ष के ऐप या वेबसाइट पर पुनः निर्देशित किया जा सकता है, जो Playtika के स्वामित्व वाली या संचालित किसी साइट या ऐप पर होस्ट नहीं किया गया हो सकता है। यदि आप किसी तृतीय पक्ष के प्लेटफार्म जैसे कि सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म के माध्यम से खेल रहे(ही) हैं, तो किसी विज्ञापन पर क्लिक करने से आपको किसी तृतीय पक्ष के प्लेटफार्म पर फिर से निर्देशित किए जा सकते हैं, जो अब सोशल मीडिया प्रदाता या Playtika द्वारा होस्ट नहीं किया जाता है।_

* _हमारी सेवा से पुश नोटिफिकेशन बंद करने के लिए अपनी डिवाइस और/या ब्राउज़र की सेटिंग्स बदलना। हमारे कुछ ऐप्स में इन-गेम सेटिंग्स में पुश नोटिफिकेशन को अक्षम करने का विकल्प भी होता है।_

#### अनुकूलित विज्ञापन से ऑप्ट आउट करना

_

आप जहां रहते(ती) हैं और जहां से हमारी सेवाओं तक पहुंचते(ती) हैं, उसके आधार पर आपको तृतीय पक्ष द्वारा बनाए गए विज्ञापन से बाहर निकलने का अधिकार हो सकता है। ऐसे मामलों में, यदि आप तृतीय-पक्ष द्वारा तैयार किए गए विज्ञापनों से ऑप्ट-आउट करना चाहें तो हम अपने ऐप्स की सेटिंग्स में एक टॉगल प्रदान करते हैं, जिससे किसी भी समय इन विज्ञापनों को अक्षम किया जा सकता है।

अपनी डिवाइस पर विज्ञापन ट्रैकिंग सेटिंग्स समायोजित करके अनुकूलित विज्ञापन से बाहर निकलने का विकल्प भी चुना जा सकता है। यह आपकी डिवाइस पर विज्ञापन आईडेन्टिफायर (जैसे कि IDFA) को रीसेट करके किया जा सकता है या आप Digital Advertising Alliance के "AppChoices" ऐप जैसे ऐप डाउनलोड करने में सक्षम हो सकते हैं, जो अनुकूलित विज्ञापन के लिए क्रॉस-ऐप जानकारी के संग्रह और उपयोग को नियंत्रित करने में आपकी सहायता कर सकते हैं।

AppChoices ऐप जैसे तृतीय पक्ष ऑप्ट-आउट टूल स्वतंत्र रूप से संचालित और स्वामित्व वाले होते हैं। Playtika इन टूल्स या विज्ञापन देने वालों और अन्य लोगों द्वारा इन टूल्स के माध्यम से प्रदान किए जाने वाले विकल्पों को नियंत्रित, संचालित या समर्थन नहीं करते हैं। इन्हें यहां केवल खिलाड़ियों की सुविधा के लिए सूचीबद्ध किया गया है।

Playtika वर्तमान में हमारी सेवाओं को चलाने वाले किसी भी प्लेटफॉर्म पर "ट्रैक न करें" सिग्नल पर प्रतिक्रिया नहीं देता है।

कृपया ध्यान दें कि यदि आप अनुकूलित विज्ञापन से बाहर निकलते(ती) हैं तो भी आपको Playtika के खेलों के भीतर Playtika और तृतीय पक्षों से विज्ञापन प्राप्त हो सकते हैं; लेकिन ये विज्ञापन आपके लिए अनुकूलित नहीं होंगे।

हमारी सेवा में अन्य वेबसाइट्स और/या ऐप्लिकेशन्स के लिंक शामिल हो सकते हैं जो दूसरों के स्वामित्व में हैं और/या उनके द्वारा संचालित हैं।

Playtika के स्वामित्व या संचालन से इतर सेवाओं को आपके द्वारा प्रदान की गई कोई भी जानकारी, आपके द्वारा देखी गई वेबसाइट या ऐप की गोपनीयता नीति के अधीन होगी, और हम बाहरी साइट और/या ऐप की सामग्री, गोपनीयता नीति, उपयोग की शर्तों या सुरक्षा प्रथाओं के लिए जिम्मेदार नहीं हैं। आपको जिस भी साइट या ऐप का उपयोग करना हो, उसकी शर्तों और गोपनीयता नीति की समीक्षा करनी चाहिए।

_यदि हम अपनी गोपनीयता सूचना में कोई भी महत्वपूर्ण बदलाव करते हैं तो हम आपको उचित तरीके से सूचित करेंगे। यदि कानून के अनुसार अपेक्षित होगा, तो हम आपको हमारे पास मौजूद आपके ई-मेल पते पर या गेम में पॉप-अप के माध्यम से भी नोटिस भेजेंगे। हम गेम ब्लॉग, सोशल नेटवर्क पेज और/या फोरम और अन्य Playtika वेबसाइट्स पर नोटिस देकर भी यह प्रक्रिया पूरी कर सकते हैं। हालाँकि, हम अनुशंसा करते हैं कि आप समय-समय पर अपडेट के लिए_ [_www.Playtika.com_](http://www.playtika.com/)_और इस गोपनीयता नोटिस की जाँच करें।_

_

#### बच्चे

हम बाल संरक्षण कानूनों का अनुपालन करने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध हैं। हमारे कुछ खेलों में हम बच्चों को हमारी सेवाओं तक पहुंचने से रोकने के लिए आयु सीमा का उपयोग करते हैं। हमारे कुछ खेलों (Best Fiends और Best Fiends Stars सहित) में प्रतिबंधित पहुंच वाले संस्करण हैं, जिन्हें हम बच्चों द्वारा खेलने या अकाउंट बनाने का प्रयास करने पर उपलब्ध कराते हैं, जिनमें सीमित गेम सुविधाएं और डेटा प्रोसेसिंग होती है।

[**अतिरिक्त जानकारी +**](#Section24)

#### खेलने के लिए मेरी उम्र कितनी होनी चाहिए?

_Playtika की_ [_सेवा की शर्तें_](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) _एक निश्चित आयु से कम (आपके द्वारा खेले जाने वाले खेल और आपके निवास स्थान के कानून के आधार पर) उपयोगकर्ताओं द्वारा हमारे कुछ गेम्स के उपयोग को प्रतिबंधित करती हैं। कुछ गेम्स में हम किसी से भी सेवाओं पर जानकारी एकत्र करने को प्रतिबंधित कर सकते हैं, बच्चों से सेवाओं पर जानकारी एकत्र करने को सीमित करते हुए बच्चों को सेवाओं का उपयोग करने की अनुमति देने के लिए आयु सीमा लागू कर सकते हैं, या बच्चों से जानकारी एकत्र करने के लिए माता-पिता या अभिभावक की अनुमति की आवश्यकता हो सकती है।_

_हम आपको हमारी सेवा पर आयु संबंधी दिशानिर्देशों और प्रतिबंधों के बारे में अधिक जानकारी के लिए हमारी_ [_सेवा की शर्तों_](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) _की समीक्षा करने की सलाह देते हैं।_

#### आयु सीमा क्या है और यह कैसे काम करती है?

_

आयु सीमा एक ऐसी प्रणाली है जिसे एक निश्चित आयु से कम के उपयोगकर्ताओं को ऐप्स और वेबसाइट्स तक पहुंचने से रोकने के लिए या विभिन्न आयु समूहों को उपयुक्त अनुभव सुनिश्चित करने के लिए लागू किया जा सकता है।

यदि आप आयु सीमा वाला कोई गेम खेल रहे(ही) हैं, तो एक पॉप-अप आएगा जिसमें आपसे आपकी आयु के बारे में जानकारी मांगी जाएगी। इस जानकारी का उपयोग केवल यह सत्यापित करने के लिए किया जाता है कि आप गेम खेलने के लिए पर्याप्त आयु के(की) हैं।

_

#### मेरा(री) बच्चा(ची) Playtika गेम खेल रहा(ही) है

_Playtika बच्चों की सुरक्षा से संबंधित कानूनों का अनुपालन करने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध है। यदि आपको लगता है कि आपके बच्चे ने Playtika को कोई जानकारी दी है या हमारी सेवा की शर्तों का उल्लंघन करते हुए और/या आपकी सहमति के बिना Playtika गेम खेल रहा(ही) है, तो कृपया हमसे [\[email protected\]](https://www.playtika.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) पर संपर्क करें। हम ऐसी जानकारी को यथाशीघ्र हटाने के लिए उचित कदम उठाएंगे।_

_16 वर्ष से कम आयु के उपभोक्ताओं की जानकारी को Playtika क्रॉस-संदर्भ व्यवहार संबंधी विज्ञापन के प्रयोजनों के लिए बेचती या साझा नहीं करती है। हम विश्लेषण और विज्ञापन उद्देश्यों के लिए जानकारी की पहचान रद्द कर सकते हैं, ऐसी स्थिति में हम जानकारी की पहचान करने का प्रयास नहीं करेंगे।_

**_वित्तीय प्रोत्साहन की नोटिस।_** _हम पुरस्कार कार्यक्रम जैसे प्रोत्साहन पेश करते हैं, जो पुरस्कार और विशेष ऑफर जैसे कुछ विशेष लाभों की पेशकश करते हैं, साथ ही स्वीपस्टेक्स या प्रतियोगिता जैसे अन्य कार्यक्रम भी पेश करते हैं। इन कार्यक्रमों के प्रयोजनों के लिए, हम आपका नाम और संपर्क जानकारी के साथ-साथ सेवाओं के आपके उपयोग के बारे में जानकारी भी एकत्र कर सकते हैं। हम ऊपर वर्णित अनुसार इस जानकारी को प्रकट, बेच या साझा कर सकते हैं। इन प्रोत्साहनों या कार्यक्रमों को अमरीकी राज्य गोपनीयता कानूनों के तहत "वित्तीय प्रोत्साहन" या "सच्ची वफादारी कार्यक्रम" माना जा सकता है।_

_यदि हमें कानून द्वारा ऐसे कार्यक्रमों के माध्यम से प्राप्त जानकारी को मूल्य निर्दिष्ट करने की आवश्यकता होती है, तो हम आपके हित के अनुरूप भविष्य के प्रस्तावों को साझा करने के मूल्य के आधार पर एकत्रित और उपयोग की गई जानकारी का मूल्यांकन करेंगे, जिसका मूल्य एकत्रित की गई जानकारी की श्रेणियों और पेश या प्रचारित किए जा रहे उत्पाद पर निर्भर हो सकता है।_

_किसी भी प्रोत्साहन कार्यक्रम में भागीदारी स्वैच्छिक है, और किसी कार्यक्रम के लिए साइन अप करके, आप कार्यक्रम के संबंध में अपनी जानकारी के संग्रह, उपयोग और प्रकटीकरण के लिए सहमति देते(ती) हैं। यदि आप बाद में अपनी सहमति वापस लेना चाहें तो हमसे संपर्क करके ऐसा किया जा सकता है या अन्यथा यदि लागू हों तो विशिष्ट कार्यक्रम के नियमों और शर्तों में निर्धारित निर्देशों का पालन किया जा सकता है।_

_कृपया ध्यान दें कि यदि अपनी जानकारी की बिक्री या साझाकरण या लक्षित विज्ञापन के लिए अपनी जानकारी के उपयोग से बाहर निकलने का विकल्प चुना जाता है तो हमारे कार्यक्रमों में आपकी भागीदारी प्रभावित नहीं होगी और आपको वे सभी लाभ मिलते रहेंगे जिनके(की) आप हकदार हैं। यदि आपकी ओर से अपनी समस्त जानकारी को हटाने का अनुरोध मिलता है तो हम आपको कोई भी कार्यक्रम लाभ प्रदान नहीं कर सकेंगे, क्योंकि हमारे पास आपको उन लाभों से जोड़ने का कोई तरीका नहीं होगा जिन पर आपका हक था या उनके संबंध में आपसे संपर्क करने का कोई तरीका नहीं होगा।_

#### कुकीज़ और अन्य प्रौद्योगिकियाँ

हम अपनी सेवा और वेबसाइट का उपयोग करने के तरीके के बारे में जानकारी एकत्र करने के लिए कुकीज़ और अन्य प्रौद्योगिकियों का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, जिससे हमें अपनी सेवा में सुधार करने और अपने विज्ञापन को लक्षित करने जैसी चीजों में सहायता मिल सके।

हम अन्य प्रयोजनों के लिए भी कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता ("AI") सहित प्रौद्योगिकी का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, जैसे कि नई सुविधाएं प्रदान करना या हमारी सेवा कार्यक्षमता में सहायता करना।

[**अतिरिक्त जानकारी +**](#Section30)

#### कुकीज़ व समान प्रौद्योगिकियाँ

_कुकी एक छोटी डेटा फाइल होती है जो रिकॉर्ड रखने के उद्देश्य से आपके डिवाइस पर ट्रांसफर की जाती है। कुकी में शामिल जानकारी आपकी ब्राउज़िंग गतिविधि जैसी जानकारी से जुड़ी हो सकती है। हम आपकी डिवाइस पर कुकीज़ रख सकते हैं और उनका उपयोग हमारी सेवा की गुणवत्ता में सुधार करने, हमारी सेवा को उपयोग में आसान बनाने और लक्षित विज्ञापन दिखाने जैसे उद्देश्यों के लिए कर सकते हैं। तृतीय पक्ष विज्ञापनदाता और सेवा प्रदाता भी आपके डिवाइस पर नीचे बतायी गयी कुकीज़ या अन्य तकनीकों का उपयोग, स्थान या पठन कर सकते हैं, और ये प्रथाएं उनकी अपनी नीतियों के अधीन होती हैं।_

_कुकीज़ के दो प्रकार होते हैं: जरूरी कुकीज़ और गैर-जरूरी कुकीज़। हम आपको हमारी वेबसाइट के अन्य उपयोगकर्ताओं से अलग करने और हमारी Playtika वेबसाइट को ठीक से संचालित करने के लिए आवश्यक कुकीज़ का उपयोग करते हैं।_

_अपने वेब ब्राउज़र को सेट करके या तृतीय पक्ष के प्लगइन का उपयोग करके आवश्यक कुकीज़ सहित सभी कुकीज़ को ब्लॉक किया जा सकता है, ताकि आपको अपने डिवाइस पर कुकीज़ रखने के प्रयासों के बारे में चेतावनी दी जा सके या आप अपने डिवाइस पर किस प्रकार की कुकीज़ रखने की अनुमति देते(ती) हैं, इसे सीमित कर सकें।_

_कुकीज़ का उपयोग करने वाली Playtika वेबसाइट्स पर, वेबसाइट पर अपनी पहली विजिट पर कुकी बैनर के माध्यम से अपनी कुकी सेटिंग्स और सहमति को अनुकूलित किया जा सकता है या अपनी प्राथमिकताओं को किसी भी समय बदलने के लिए वेबपेज फुटर या कुकी विजेट में "कुकीज़ सेटिंग्स" लिंक पर क्लिक किया जा सकता है।_

_कृपया ध्यान दें कि यदि कुकीज़ अक्षम की जाती हैं, तो हमारी सेवा के कुछ फीचर्स और कार्यक्षमता अनुपलब्ध हो सकते हैं। Playtika वर्तमान में 'ट्रैक न करें' सिग्नलों पर प्रतिक्रिया नहीं करती है, चाहे वह सिग्नल कंप्यूटर पर प्राप्त हो या मोबाइल डिवाइस पर।_

_हम अन्य समान तकनीकों का भी उपयोग कर सकते हैं जिनमें निम्नलिखित शामिल हैं:_

* _वेब बीकन, जो हमें यह जानने की अनुमति दे सकते हैं कि क्या कोई निश्चित पेज देखा गया था या क्या कोई ई-मेल खोला गया था;_
* _विज्ञापन आईडेन्टिफायर्स जैसे कि Android और Apple विज्ञापन ID जिसे IDFA या GAID के रूप में जाना जाता है, जो आपकी डिवाइस से जुड़े होते हैं और आपकी डिवाइस पर रीसेट किए जा सकते हैं;_
* _ट्रैकिंग पिक्सल, जो हमें या हमारे विज्ञापन पार्टनर्स को आपके डिवाइस को चालू, बंद और विभिन्न सेवाओं और डिवाइसों पर पहचान कर और एक नई स्थापना के स्रोत की पहचान करके अधिक कुशलतापूर्वक और प्रभावी ढंग से विज्ञापन करने की अनुमति दे सकता है; और_
* _स्थानीय साझा ऑब्जेक्ट, जिन्हें फ्लैश कुकीज़ भी कहा जाता है, जो हमें धोखाधड़ी को कम करने, आपकी इन-गेम प्राथमिकताओं को याद रखने और लोड टाइम को तेज करने में मदद कर सकती हैं।_

_हम Google Analytics, Facebook Audience Insights और/या तृतीय पक्षों की अन्य समान सेवाओं का उपयोग कर सकते हैं जो आपके व्यवहार और जनसांख्यिकी के बारे में जानकारी एकत्र करते हैं। Google Analytics के बारे में अधिक जानकारी के लिए, कृपया उनकी वेबसाइट (_[_www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/_](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)_) पर जाएं, जहां Google के जानकारी संग्रह और प्रोसेसिंग से ऑप्ट आउट किया जा सकता है।_

_हम फ्लैश कुकीज़ का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, जो ब्राउज़र कुकीज़ से भिन्न तरीके से काम करती हैं। फ्लैश कुकीज़ के बारे में अधिक जानने और उन्हें प्रबंधित करने के लिए Adobe वेबसाइट पर जाया जा सकता है और वैश्विक गोपनीयता सेटिंग्स पैनल में परिवर्तन किया जा सकता है।_

#### कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता

_

हम ऐसी तकनीकों का उपयोग कर सकते हैं जिन्हें (a) स्वचालित निर्णय लेने या प्रोफाइलिंग माना जा सकता है, और/या (b) हमारी सेवा को बेहतर बनाने के लिए हमारे द्वारा एकत्रित की गई जानकारी (उदाहरण के लिए, इन-गेम गतिविधि और हमारी सेवा के भीतर संचार सहित) का मूल्यांकन करने के लिए कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता (ऐसी तकनीक जो बुद्धिमान मानव व्यवहार की नकल करती है) के प्रशिक्षण, परीक्षण और उपयोग के हिस्से के रूप में जानकारी की प्रोसेसिंग शामिल है। उदाहरण के लिए, ग्राहक सहायता प्रक्रियाओं को सुविधाजनक बनाने के लिए, सर्वेक्षणों का संचालन करने के लिए, आपकी प्राथमिकताओं के अनुसार हमारी सेवा अनुकूलित करने के लिए तथा अन्य वैध व्यावसायिक उद्देश्यों के लिए।

_

#### आपके अधिकार

#### الأطفال

نحن ملتزمون بالامتثال لقوانين حماية الطفل. في بعض ألعابنا، نستخدم آليات تُقيِّد الوصول حسب الفئة العمرية، وذلك لمنع وصول الأطفال إلى خدماتنا. لدى بعض ألعابنا (بما في ذلك Best Fiends وBest Fiends Stars) إصدارات ذات إمكانية وصول مقيدة نوفرها عندما يحاول الأطفال اللعب أو إنشاء حساب، والتي تتضمن ميزات محدودة للعبة ومعالجة بيانات.

[**المزيد من المعلومات +**](#Section24)

#### كم يجب أن يكون عمري حتى أتمكن من اللعب؟

_تقيد_ [_شروط الخدمة_](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) _في_ _Playtika_ _استخدام بعض ألعابنا من قِبل المستخدمين الذين تقل أعمارهم عن عمر معين (اعتمادًا على اللعبة التي تلعبها والقانون المعمول به في مكان إقامتك). في بعض الألعاب، يجوز لنا تقييد جمع المعلومات المتعلقة بالخدمات من أي شخص، أو تطبيق نظام تحقق من العمر يسمح للأطفال باستخدام الخدمات مع تقييد جمع المعلومات المتعلقة بالخدمات من الأطفال، أو طلب إذن أحد الوالدين أو الوصي لجمع المعلومات من الأطفال._

_نوصيك بمراجعة_ [_شروط الخدمة_](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) _الخاصة بنا للحصول على مزيد من التفاصيل حول المبادئ التوجيهية المتعلقة بالعمر والقيود المفروضة على خدمتنا._

#### ما المقصود بنظام التحقق من العمر وكيف يعمل؟

_

نظام التحقق من العمر هو نظام يمكن استخدامه لمنع المستخدمين الذين تقل أعمارهم عن سن معينة من الوصول إلى التطبيقات ومواقع الويب أو لضمان حصول الفئات العمرية المختلفة على تجربة مناسبة.

إذا كنت تلعب لعبة تتضمن نظامًا للتحقق من العمر، فستظهر نافذة منبثقة تطلب منك تقديم معلومات عن عمرك. تُستخدم هذه المعلومات فقط للتحقق من أنك في عمر مناسب للعب اللعبة.

#### ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المماثلة

_ملف تعريف الارتباط هو ملف بيانات صغير يتم نقله إلى جهازك لأغراض حفظ السجلات. قد يتم ربط المعلومات الواردة في ملف تعريف الارتباط بالمعلومات، مثل نشاط التصفح الخاص بك. يجوز لنا وضع ملفات تعريف الارتباط على جهازك واستخدامها لأغراض مثل تحسين جودة خدمتنا، وجعل خدمتنا أسهل استخدامًا، وتقديم إعلانات موجهة. يجوز للمعلنين ومقدمي الخدمات التابعين لجهات خارجية أيضًا استخدام ملفات تعريف الارتباط أو وضعها أو قراءها على جهازك على النحو الموضح أدناه، وتخضع هذه الممارسات لسياساتهم الخاصة._

_يوجد نوعان من ملفات تعريف الارتباط: ملفات تعريف الارتباط الأساسية وملفات تعريف الارتباط غير الأساسية. نحن نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط الأساسية للتمييز بينك وبين المستخدمين الآخرين لموقعنا الإلكتروني_ _Playtika_ _وتشغيل موقعنا الإلكتروني بشكل صحيح._

_يمكنك حظر جميع ملفات تعريف الارتباط، بما في ذلك ملفات تعريف الارتباط الأساسية، من خلال ضبط إعدادات مستعرضات الويب أو استخدام مكونات إضافية تابعة لجهات خارجية لتحذيرك من محاولات وضع ملفات تعريف الارتباط على جهازك أو تقييد نوع ملفات تعريف الارتباط التي تسمح بوضعها على جهازك._

_في مواقع_ _Playtika_ _الإلكترونية التي تستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط، يمكنك تخصيص إعدادات ملفات تعريف الارتباط والموافقات الخاصة بك عبر لافتة ملفات تعريف الارتباط في زيارتك الأولى لموقع الويب أو النقر فوق رابط "إعدادات ملفات تعريف الارتباط" في الهامش السفلي لصفحة الويب أو أداة ملفات تعريف الارتباط لتغيير تفضيلاتك في أي وقت._

_يجوز لنا أيضًا استخدام تقنيات مماثلة أخرى بما في ذلك:_

* _إشارات الويب، والتي قد تسمح لنا بمعرفة ما إذا كانت صفحة معينة قد تمت زيارتها أو ما إذا كان قد تم فتح رسالة البريد الإلكتروني؛_
* _ومعرفات الإعلانات مثل معرف إعلانات_ _Android_ _و__Apple_ _المعروف باسم_ _IDFA_ _أو_ _GAID__، والتي تكون متصلة بجهازك ويمكن إعادة تعيينها على جهازك؛_
* _ووحدات بكسل التتبع، والتي قد تسمح لنا أو لشركائنا الإعلانيين بالإعلان بصورة أكثر كفاءة وفعالية من خلال التعرف على جهازك (أجهزتك) في حالة تشغيله وإيقاف تشغيله وعبر خدمات وأجهزة مختلفة وتحديد مصدر التثبيت الجديد؛ و_
* _والكائنات التي تتم مشاركتها محليًا، والمعروفة أيضًا باسم ملفات تعريف الارتباط الفلاش، والتي قد تساعدنا في الحد من الاحتيال وتذكر تفضيلاتك داخل اللعبة وتسريع أوقات التحميل._

_يجوز لنا استخدام_ _Google Analytics_ _و__Facebook Audience Insights_ _أو خدمات مماثلة أخرى من جهات خارجية تجمع معلومات عن سلوكك وخلفيتك الديموغرافية. لمزيد من المعلومات عن_ _Google Analytics__، يرجى زيارة موقع الإلكتروني الخاص بهم (_[_www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners__/_](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)_) حيث يمكنك إلغاء الاشتراك في جمع المعلومات ومعالجتها من قِبل_ _Google__._

#### الذكاء الاصطناعي

_

يجوز لنا استخدام التقنيات التي (أ) يمكن اعتبارها عملية تلقائية لاتخاذ القرارات أو إنشاء ملفات التعريف، و/أو (ب) تتضمن معالجة المعلومات كجزء من التدريب على الذكاء الاصطناعي واختباره واستخدامه (وهو تقنية تحاكي السلوك البشري الذكي) لتقييم المعلومات التي نجمعها (بما في ذلك، على سبيل المثال، النشاط داخل اللعبة والاتصالات داخل خدمتنا) لتحسين خدمتنا. على سبيل المثال، لتسهيل عمليات دعم العملاء، وإجراء الاستطلاعات وتخصيص خدمتنا وفقًا لتفضيلاتك ولأغراض تجارية مشروعة أخرى.

_

"קובץ עוגיות" הינו קובץ נתונים קטן המועבר למכשירכם לצורכי תיעוד. מידע הקיים בקובץ העוגיות אפשר שיקושר לנתונים מסוימים, כגון פעילות גלישה. ייתכן שנתקין קבצי עוגיות על גבי מכשירכם ושנשתמש בהם למטרות שונות, כגון שיפור איכות השירות שלנו, הקלת השימוש בו ופרסומות ממוקדות. מפרסמים צד ג וספקי שירות שלישיים עשויים להשתמש, להתקין או לקרוא קבצי עוגיות או טכנולוגיות אחרות על גבי מכשירכם כמבואר להלן, ופעולות אלו כפופות לנהלי המדיניות של צדדים שלישיים אלו.

קיימים שני סוגים של קבצי עוגיות: עוגיות חיוניות ועוגיות בלתי-חיוניות אנו משתמשים בעוגיות חיוניות על מנת להבדיל ביניכם לבין משתמשים אחרים באתר האינטרנט של פלייטיקה ועל מנת להפעיל בצורה תקינה את אתר האינטרנט שלנו.

באפשרותכם לחסום את כל העוגיות, לרבות עוגיות חיוניות, וזאת ע"י שינוי ההגדרות בדפדפן האינטרנט שלכם או באמצעות תוספים צד ג' המזהירים אתכם לגבי ניסיונות להוריד עוגיות לתוך מכשירכם או המאפשרים לכם להגביל את סוג העוגיות שאותם תאפשרו על גבי המכשיר שלכם.

* משואות אינטרנט (web beacons), אשר מאפשרות לנו לדעת אם התבצע ביקור בדף מסוים או אם הודעת דוא"ל מסוימת נפתחה.
* מזהי פרסומת, כגון "מזהי פרסומת לאנדרואיד ואפל" (Android and Apple advertising ID) – IDFA / GAID, המקושרים למכשירכם ושאותם ניתן לאפס על גבי מכשירכם.
* פיקסלים למעקב (tracking pixels), המאפשרים לנו או לשותפי הפרסום שלנו לפרסם ביעילות רבה יותר על ידי זיהוי המכשיר שלכם על גבי שירותים ומכשירים שונים, מחוץ להם וביניהם, ועל ידי זיהוי המקור שממנו מתבצעת התקנה חדשה; וכן
* אובייקטים משותפים מקומית (הידועים גם בכינוי "עוגיות פלאש"), אשר מסייעים לנו בצמצום היקפן של פעילויות הונאה והמאפשרים לנו לזכור את העדפות המשחק שלכם ולזרז את זמני הטעינה.

ייתכן שנשתמש ב-Google Analytics, Facebook Audience Insights ובשירותים דומים ואחרים הניתנים על ידי צדדים שלישיים שאוספים מידע אודות ההתנהגות והנתונים הדמוגרפיים שלכם. לקבלת מידע נוסף בדבר Google Analytics, אנא בקרו באתר האינטרנט שכתובתו: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)) . באתר זה תוכלו לבטל את איסוף ועיבוד המידע של גוגל.

Wij kunnen informatie verwerken om deze functies mogelijk te maken en u in staat te stellen contact te houden met uw familie en vrienden. Een deel van de gegevens die wij verzamelen of verwerken, kan worden verstrekt door externe platforms, zoals Facebook. Voor meer informatie over hoe uw socialmediagegevens worden gedeeld, kunt u terecht in de instellingen van uw socialmediaprofiel en het privacybeleid van het platform.

**Advertenties**

Wij kunnen gegevens gebruiken om de integratie van reclame in onze games met advertenties te ondersteunen. Wij kunnen uw informatie ook delen met derden, zoals onze advertentiepartners, om de functionaliteit en de targeting van advertenties te verbeteren. Meer informatie over hoe wij uw gegevens gebruiken voor reclamedoeleinden vindt u in het gedeelte Advertenties en marketing van deze Verklaring.

**Evenementen**

Alle informatie die tijdens onze evenementen wordt verzameld, kan worden gebruikt om ons te helpen bij de planning van toekomstige evenementen, onze promotionele activiteiten of de interacties van uw accountmanager met u.

**Bedrijfsmanagement**

Wij kunnen informatie over u en uw gameplay gebruiken ter ondersteuning van ons bedrijfsbeheer en onze bedrijfsplanning. Dit geeft ons bijvoorbeeld inzicht in de manier waarop gebruikers omgaan met onze Dienst en hoe Playtika onze games voor onze gebruikers en marketingactiviteiten kan ontwikkelen en verbeteren.

_

#### HOE WIJ INFORMATIE DELEN

Om u onze Diensten te kunnen leveren, kunnen wij uw informatie delen binnen Playtika of met onze dienstverleners en zakenpartners voor analyse-, marketing- en andere zakelijke doeleinden. Sommige informatie over u is mogelijk ook toegankelijk voor andere gebruikers van onze Diensten, zoals de informatie in uw spelersprofiel.

[**Meer informatie +**](#Section8)

#### INFORMATIE DIE BESCHIKBAAR IS VOOR ANDERE GEBRUIKERS

_

U kunt ervoor kiezen om informatie over uzelf vrij te geven wanneer u gebruik maakt van onze Diensten en bijdraagt of deelneemt aan chatrooms, blogs, forums, spelersprofielen of vergelijkbare functionaliteiten. Sommige van deze functies kunnen ook integratie met websites of diensten van derden omvatten, zodat u met andere spelers kunt communiceren (bijvoorbeeld via privéberichten of e-mail).

Alle informatie die u via deze functies verstrekt, inclusief foto's en video's, kan mogelijk worden geopend, gelezen, bekeken, verzameld en gebruikt door Playtika en Playtika-gebruikers. Playtika is niet verantwoordelijk voor de informatie die u openbaar maakt of deelt in uw account. Raadpleeg onze [Servicevoorwaarden](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) voor begeleiding en informatie over het plaatsen van content via onze Dienst.

U kunt informatie over uw vrienden en familie importeren of handmatig invoeren om sociale functies van onze Dienst in te schakelen. Vervolgens kunt u via onze Diensten contact met hen opnemen of hen uitnodigen om de Diensten te gebruiken.

Sommige sociale functies die beschikbaar zijn tijdens het gamen, registreren of inloggen via een socialmedia-account, kunnen gegevens van uw Playtika-activiteit, zoals gameplay, naam en profielfoto, delen met uw socialmediacontacten of vrienden. Als u onze Dienst gebruikt naar aanleiding van een uitnodiging van een andere speler via sociale media, kan die speler informatie over u en uw gameplay zien, zoals wanneer u zich hebt aangemeld en welke levels u hebt bereikt.

In veel Playtika-games kunnen andere spelers van de game details over uw gameplay zien, met u communiceren en toegang krijgen tot uw gebruikersprofiel en de informatie die daarin beschikbaar is. Andere spelers kunnen u mogelijk spelverzoeken of verzoeken voor uw socialmedia-accounts sturen als u ervoor kiest om één van uw socialmedia-accounts en/of Playtika-communicatiekanalen te integreren.

_

#### EXTERNE DIENSTVERLENERS EN ZAKENPARTNERS

_

Playtika maakt gebruik van onafhankelijke bedrijven om de door ons geleverde Dienst te ondersteunen, bijvoorbeeld om ons te helpen bij het verwerken van betalingen, het analyseren van informatie, het optimaliseren van gameplay en het verbeteren van spelerservaring, het bezorgen van e-mails, het hosten van diensten, evenementsdiensten, het leveren van beveiligingsdiensten, het uitvoeren van onze marketingcampagnes en het beheren en leveren van contextuele en op maat gemaakte reclame.

_

#### VERKOOP OF FUSIE

_

Indien Playtika een herstructurering van welke aard dan ook nastreeft of ondergaat, waaronder de verkoop, aankoop, fusie met en/of overname door een ander bedrijf van Playtika-activa, kunnen wij relevante informatie bekendmaken aan de andere organisaties die bij de overgang betrokken zijn. Wij zullen redelijke inspanningen leveren om u te informeren of dit gebeurt en welke gevolgen dit heeft voor uw gegevens, voor zover dit wettelijk vereist is.

_

#### PUBLICITEIT EN MARKTANALYSE

_

We kunnen ook samengevoegde en analytische informatie publiceren (informatie over u en andere spelers als geheel, die niet bedoeld is om specifieke spelers te identificeren, bijvoorbeeld spelers tussen de 25 en 50 jaar die in de VS wonen) en andere geanonimiseerde informatie over onze spelers. Wij doen dit met het oog op brancheanalyses, demografische profilering, marketing, analyses, reclame en andere zakelijke doeleinden.

_

#### WETTELIJKE VERPLICHTINGEN EN NALEVING

_Wij delen mogelijk informatie om te voldoen aan onze wettelijke verplichtingen en om te voldoen aan wetshandhavingsvoorschriften._

_Voorbeelden van situaties waarin wij informatie kunnen delen, zijn:_

* _wanneer wij te goeder trouw besluiten om informatie openbaar te maken als reactie op rechtmatige verzoeken van overheidsinstanties, waaronder verzoeken om te voldoen aan de nationale veiligheid of vereisten van wetshandhaving, of een juridisch proces (bijvoorbeeld een gerechtelijk bevel, huiszoekingsbevel of dagvaarding);_
* _om te voldoen aan wetten, voorschriften of verplichte gedragscodes die van ons vereisen dat wij details bekendmaken over de informatie die wij verzamelen;_
* _indien wij reden hebben om aan te nemen dat onze Dienst wordt gebruikt om een misdrijf te plegen, kunnen wij uw gegevens delen om de vermoedelijke criminele activiteit te melden en te onderzoeken, of om nadere gegevens te delen met andere bedrijven en organisaties ter voorkoming, melding of onderzoek van vermoedelijke criminele activiteiten. Dit kan ook maatregelen omvatten om fraude te voorkomen, het kredietrisico te beperken en andere veiligheidsmaatregelen te nemen. Deze openbaarmaking gebeurt naar eigen goeddunken;_
* _wanneer wij reden hebben om aan te nemen dat er sprake is van een noodsituatie die een gevaar vormt voor de gezondheid en/of veiligheid van een persoon, waaronder onze gebruikers, werknemers of het algemene publiek. Deze openbaarmaking gebeurt naar eigen goeddunken;_
* _om de rechten of eigendommen van Playtika en andere derden te beschermen, waaronder onze_ [_Servicevoorwaarden_](https://playtika.com/terms-service)_._

#### ADVERTEREN EN MARKETING

We kunnen informatie, zoals apparaat-ID's en in-game-evenementen, gebruiken en delen met onze dienstverleners en zakenpartners om onze marketingcampagnes uit te voeren, te meten en te optimaliseren (bijvoorbeeld om advertenties voor onze Diensten op andere websites of apps te tonen).

Bovendien bevatten sommige van onze Diensten advertenties van externe adverteerders. Deze adverteerders kunnen bepaalde informatie verzamelen en delen (bijvoorbeeld of u op de advertentie klikt) om de functionaliteit en de targeting van advertenties te verbeteren.

Wij registreren of u toestemming hebt gegeven voor het ontvangen van promotionele en marketingcommunicatie van ons. Als u toestemming hebt gegeven om marketingcommunicatie van ons te ontvangen, bijv. via e-mail of sms, gebruiken wij de informatie die wij over u en uw interesses hebben verzameld, evenals uw contactgegevens om u ons marketingmateriaal te sturen. Sommige van deze marketingmaterialen kunnen ook via onze apps of in-game-meldingen worden verzonden.

[**Meer informatie +**](#Section14)

#### ADVERTENTIES

_Om de functionaliteit van de advertenties die u op onze Dienst ziet te ondersteunen en deze te personaliseren, en om onze eigen marketingcampagnes uit te voeren, te meten en te optimaliseren en prestatieanalyses uit te voeren, kunnen onze advertentiepartners de volgende soorten gegevens verzamelen (of kunnen wij deze met hen delen):_

* _informatie over advertentieprestaties (zoals het aantal klikken op een advertentie);_
* _gebundelde/geanonimiseerde gegevens over spelers die bedoeld is om advertenties te targeten, maar niet om individuen rechtstreeks te identificeren (bijv. dat een speler tussen de 45 en 65 jaar oud is en in Miami woont);_
* _technische informatie over het gebruikte apparaat, zoals IP-adressen, IDFA's, GAID's en andere apparaat-ID's;_
* _gameplay-activiteit en game-evenementen, zoals uw level binnen een game en gedane aankopen; en_
* _uw socialmedia-identificatiegegevens._

_Een deel van de gegevens kan worden verzameld via cookies en andere trackingtechnologieën. Onze adverteerders kunnen meerdere vormen van trackingtechnologieën tegelijkertijd gebruiken._

_Als u op een advertentie klikt, wordt u mogelijk doorgestuurd naar een app of website van een derde partij. Deze wordt mogelijk niet gehost op een site of app die eigendom is van of beheerd wordt door Playtika. Als u via een platform van derden speelt, bijv. via een socialmediaplatform, kunt u door op een advertentie te klikken, worden doorgestuurd naar een platform van derden dat niet langer wordt gehost door de socialmedia-aanbieder of Playtika._

#### AFMELDEN VOOR E-MAILS EN PUSHMELDINGEN

_Als u zich wilt afmelden voor promotionele of marketingcommunicatie van Playtika, kunt u dit als volgt doen:_

* _Door op 'uitschrijven' te klikken in een promotionele e-mail van een specifieke Dienst van Playtika, kunt u uw contactvoorkeuren voor e-mails van ons wijzigen en bijwerken (houd er rekening mee dat we nog steeds contact met u kunnen opnemen via e-mail met betrekking tot uw account, bijv. voor het opnieuw instellen van uw wachtwoord of ander accountbeheer);_

_Als u zich wilt afmelden voor pushmeldingen van Playtika, kunt u dit als volgt doen:_

* _Wijzig de instellingen op uw socialmediaplatformen om meldingen van Playtika via deze platforms uit te schakelen. Bijvoorbeeld door meldingen van Playtika op Facebook uit te schakelen; en_
* _Wijzig de instellingen op uw apparaat en/of browser om pushmeldingen van onze Dienst uit te schakelen. In sommige van onze apps bieden we ook de mogelijkheid om pushmeldingen uit te schakelen in de in-game-instellingen._

#### AFMELDEN VOOR GEPERSONALISEERDE ADVERTENTIES

_

Naargelang waar u woont en onze Diensten raadpleegt, hebt u misschien het recht op u af te melden voor gepersonaliseerde advertenties van derden. In zulke gevallen, als u zich wilt afmelden voor gepersonaliseerde advertenties van derden, kunt u deze advertenties op elk gewenst moment uitschakelen via de instellingen van onze apps.

U kunt zich ook afmelden voor gepersonaliseerde advertenties door de instellingen voor advertentietracking op uw apparaat/apparaten aan te passen. U kunt dit doen door de advertentie-ID op uw apparaat opnieuw in te stellen (zoals de IDFA) of door apps te downloaden, zoals de app 'AppChoices' van de Digital Advertising Alliance, waarmee u de verzameling en het gebruik van informatie tussen apps voor gepersonaliseerde advertenties kunt beheren.

Externe hulpmiddelen voor het afmelden van cookies, zoals de AppChoices-app, worden onafhankelijk beheerd. Playtika heeft geen controle over en exploiteert of steunt deze hulpmiddelen of de keuzes die adverteerders en anderen via deze hulpmiddelen bieden niet. Ze worden hier alleen vermeld voor het gemak van de spelers.

Playtika reageert momenteel niet op 'Do Not Track'-signalen op de platforms waarop onze Diensten worden uitgevoerd.

Houd er rekening mee dat u nog steeds advertenties van Playtika en derden kunt ontvangen in de games van Playtika, zelfs als u zich afmeldt voor gepersonaliseerde advertenties. De advertenties die u ontvangt, zijn dan echter niet op u afgestemd.

_

#### ALGEMEEN

Dit gedeelte bevat meer informatie over hoe we met uw gegevens omgaan, inclusief hoe we uw gegevens veilig houden, hoelang we uw gegevens bewaren en de omstandigheden waarin we uw gegevens mogelijk internationaal overdragen.

[**Meer informatie +**](#Section18)

#### INTERNATIONALE OVERDRACHTEN

_

Het is mogelijk dat Playtika informatie verzendt, inziet, gebruikt en/of opslaat buiten het land of de regio waar u woont, bijvoorbeeld de Verenigde Staten en Israël. Wij dragen mogelijk gegevens over aan onze dochterondernemingen, dienstverleners, zakenpartners en anderen zoals beschreven in deze Privacyverklaring.

Wetten verschillen per rechtsgebied. De wetten inzake gegevensbescherming en -privacy die van toepassing zijn op de gebieden waar gegevens naartoe worden verzonden, opgeslagen, gebruikt of verwerkt, kunnen dus afwijken van de wetten die gelden in het land waar u woonachtig bent. Wanneer wij gegevens overdragen naar een locatie buiten de locatie waar deze zijn verzameld, treffen wij passende veiligheidsmaatregelen of doen wij anderszins ons best om ervoor te zorgen dat dergelijke overdrachten voldoen aan de toepasselijke lokale wettelijke vereisten. Als u meer informatie wilt over de internationale overdrachten van Playtika, gaat u naar het gedeelte Contact opnemen hieronder.

_

#### INFORMATIEBEHOUD

_

Wij kunnen gegevens bewaren zolang u gebruikmaakt van onze Dienst en zolang dit nodig is om de doeleinden te vervullen waarvoor de gegevens zijn verzameld, of zolang dit nodig is om te voldoen aan onze legitieme zakelijke doeleinden en de toepasselijke wetgeving; om te voldoen aan wettelijke, boekhoudkundige of rapportageverplichtingen; om geschillen op te lossen; om onze activa te beschermen; om onze onderneming efficiënt te runnen; en om onze overeenkomsten af te dwingen.

_

#### INFORMATIEBEVEILIGING

_

Playtika neemt passende maatregelen om uw gegevens te beschermen, waaronder het implementeren van passende technische en organisatorische maatregelen om een beveiligingsniveau te garanderen dat past bij het risico.

_

#### DIENSTEN VAN Playtika VERLATEN VIA LINKS NAAR ANDERE WEBSITES/APPS

_

Onze Dienst kan links bevatten naar andere websites en/of applicaties die eigendom zijn van anderen en/of door anderen worden beheerd.

Alle informatie die u verstrekt aan diensten die niet eigendom zijn van of worden beheerd door Playtika, valt onder het privacybeleid van de website of app die u hebt bezocht. Wij zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud, het privacybeleid, de gebruiksvoorwaarden of de beveiligingspraktijken van de externe website en/of app. U dient de voorwaarden en het privacybeleid van elke website of app die u bezoekt, te raadplegen.

_

#### UPDATES VAN DEZE PRIVACYVERKLARING

_

_Wij behouden ons het recht voor om de Privacyverklaring van tijd tot tijd te wijzigen en moedigen u aan om de Privacyverklaring van Playtika regelmatig te raadplegen op wijzigingen._

_Als wij wezenlijke wijzigingen aanbrengen in onze Privacyverklaring, stellen wij u hiervan op passende wijze op de hoogte. Indien wettelijk vereist, sturen wij ook een kennisgeving naar het e-mailadres dat bij ons bekend is of wordt u via een pop-up in de game op de hoogte gesteld. Wij kunnen dit proces ook aanvullen door mededelingen te plaatsen op gameblogs, sociale netwerkpagina's en/of forums en op andere Playtika-websites. Wij raden u echter aan om regelmatig_ [_www.Playtika.com_](http://www.playtika.com/) _en deze Privacyverklaring te controleren op updates._

_

#### KINDEREN

Wij streven ernaar de wetgeving inzake kinderbescherming na te leven. Bij sommige van onze games gebruiken we leeftijdscontroles om te voorkomen dat kinderen toegang krijgen tot onze Diensten. Bij een aantal van onze games (inclusief Best Fiends en Best Fiends Stars) hebben we versies met beperkte toegang die we beschikbaar stellen wanneer kinderen proberen te spelen of een account aan te maken. Deze versies hebben beperkte spelfuncties en gegevensverwerking.

[**Meer informatie +**](#Section24)

#### VANAF WELKE LEEFTIJD MAG IK SPELEN?

_De [Servicevoorwaarden](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) van Playtika beperken het gebruik van sommige van onze games door gebruikers jonger dan een bepaalde leeftijd (afhankelijk van de game die u speelt en de wet waar u woont). In bepaalde games kunnen wij het verzamelen van informatie via de Diensten van iedereen beperken, een leeftijdsgrens instellen waardoor kinderen de Diensten kunnen gebruiken, maar tegelijkertijd het verzamelen van informatie van kinderen via de Diensten beperken, of toestemming van een ouder of voogd vereisen om informatie van kinderen te verzamelen._

_We raden u aan onze [Servicevoorwaarden](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) te lezen voor meer informatie over leeftijdsrichtlijnen en beperkingen op onze Dienst._

#### WAT IS EEN LEEFTIJDSGRENS EN HOE WERKT HET?

_

Een leeftijdsgrens is een systeem dat kan worden ingesteld om te voorkomen dat gebruikers onder een bepaalde leeftijd toegang krijgen tot apps en websites, of om ervoor te zorgen dat verschillende leeftijdsgroepen een passende ervaring krijgen.

Als u een game speelt met een leeftijdsgrens, verschijnt er een pop-up waarin u wordt gevraagd om informatie over uw leeftijd te verstrekken. Deze informatie wordt alleen gebruikt om te verifiëren of u oud genoeg bent om de game te spelen.

_

#### MIJN KIND SPEELT EEN Playtika-GAME

_Playtika zet zich in voor het naleven van de wetten die kinderen beschermen. Als u van mening bent dat uw kind gegevens aan Playtika heeft verstrekt of een Playtika-game speelt in strijd met onze servicevoorwaarden en/of zonder uw toestemming, neem dan contact met ons op via [\[email protected\]](https://www.playtika.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) . Wij zullen alle redelijke maatregelen nemen om dergelijke informatie zo snel mogelijk te verwijderen._

#### INWONERS VAN DE VERENIGDE STATEN

Naast de voorwaarden van deze Privacyverklaring vereisen bepaalde wetten in de Amerikaanse staten dat wij inwoners van de VS aanvullende informatie verstrekken over onze privacypraktijken. Bent u een inwoner van de VS? Klik dan op Meer informatie voor verdere informatie die mogelijk op u van toepassing is.

_**Kennisgeving van een financiële incentive**. Wij bieden incentives aan, zoals een beloningsprogramma dat bepaalde voordelen biedt, zoals beloningen en exclusieve aanbiedingen, maar ook andere programma's, zoals sweepstakes of wedstrijden.

_Houd er rekening mee dat als u ervoor kiest om de verkoop, het delen of het gebruik van uw gegevens voor gerichte advertenties uit te schakelen, dit geen invloed heeft op uw deelname aan onze programma's en dat u alle voordelen blijft ontvangen waar u recht op hebt. Als u echter een verzoek indient om al uw gegevens te verwijderen, kunnen wij u geen programmavoordelen meer bieden, omdat wij u dan niet kunnen koppelen aan de voordelen waarop u recht hebt, of contact met u kunnen opnemen met betrekking tot deze voordelen._

#### 맞춤형 광고 수신 거부

_

귀하가 거주하는 지역과 당사의 서비스에 접속하는 지역에 따라 제3자의 맞춤형 광고를 거부할 권리가 있을 수 있습니다. 그러한 경우, 타사 맞춤형 광고 수신을 거부하려면 언제든지 이러한 광고를 비활성화할 수 있도록 앱 설정에서 토글 기능을 제공합니다.

또한, 기기의 광고 추적 설정을 조정하여 맞춤형 광고 수신을 거부할 수도 있습니다. 이는 기기에서 광고 식별 정보(예: IDFA)를 재설정하여 수행하거나, 맞춤형 광고를 위한 교차 앱 정보 수집 및 사용을 제어하는 데 도움이 될 수 있는 디지털 광고 연합의 “AppChoices” 앱과 같은 앱을 다운로드할 수 있습니다.

AppChoices 앱과 같은 타사 수신 거부 도구는 독립적으로 운영되고 소유됩니다. Playtika는 이러한 도구 또는 광고주 및 기타 사용자가 이러한 도구를 통해 제공하는 선택 사항을 통제, 운영 또는 보증하지 않습니다. 플레이어의 편의를 위해 여기에 나열한 것입니다.

Playtika는 현재 저희 서비스를 운영하는 어떠한 플랫폼에서도 "추적 거부" 신호에 응답하지 않습니다.

맞춤형 광고를 거부하더라도 Playtika 게임 내에서 Playtika 및 타사의 광고를 계속 받을 수 있습니다. 그러나 이러한 광고는 여러분에게 맞춤화되지 않습니다.

#### HVORDAN VI DELER INFORMASJON

For å levere våre tjenester til deg kan vi dele informasjon om deg innen Playtika eller med våre tjenesteleverandører og forretningspartnere for analyse, markedsføring og andre forretningsformål. Andre brukere på våre tjenester kan også få tilgang til noe informasjon om deg, slik som informasjonen på din spillerprofil.

#### INFORMASJON SOM ER TILGJENGELIG FOR ANDRE BRUKERE

_

Du kan velge å legge frem informasjon om deg selv ved bruk av våre tjenester når du bidrar til eller får tilgang til chatrom, blogger, meldingstavler, spillerprofiler eller lignende funksjonaliteter. Noen av disse funksjonene kan også inkludere integrering med tredjeparts sider eller tjenester for å la deg kommunisere med andre spillere (slik som via privat melding eller e-post).

Alle opplysninger du oppgir via disse funksjonene, inkludert bilder og videoer, kan potensielt åpnes, leses, sees, innsamles og brukes av Playtika og Playtika-brukere. Playtika er ikke ansvarlig for noe av den informasjonen som du velger å gjøre offentlig eller dele på din konto. Se våre [Tjenestevilkår](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) for veiledning og informasjon om posting av innhold gjennom vår tjeneste.

Noen sosiale funksjoner som er tilgjengelige der du spiller, registrerer deg eller logger inn via en sosial mediekonto, kan dele detaljer om Playtika-aktiviteten din, som spilling, navn og profilbilde, med dine forbindelser eller venner på sosiale medier. På lignende måte, hvis du bruker vår tjeneste som svar på en invitasjon fra en annen spiller via sosiale medier, så kan den spilleren se informasjon om deg og din spilling, slik som når du meldte deg inn og hvilke nivåer du har oppnådd.

I mange av Playtika-spillene kan andre spillere se detaljer om spillingen din, kommunisere med deg og få tilgang til brukerprofilen din og opplysningene som er tilgjengelige på den. Andre spillere kan kunne sende deg spillforespørsler eller kontoforespørsler via sosiale medier hvis du velger å integrere noen av dine kontoer i sosiale medier og/eller Playtika kommunikasjonskanaler.

Vi vil gjøre rimelige anstrengelser for å informere deg om dette skjer, og hvordan det påvirker din informasjon i den grad det er påkrevd av lov.

_

#### PUBLISITET OG MARKEDSANALYSE

_

Vi kan også publisere samlet og analytisk informasjon (felles informasjon om deg og andre spillere som ikke er tiltenkt å spesifikt identifisere noen individuell spiller, for eksempel, spillere mellom 25 og 50 år som bor i USA) og annen anonymisert informasjon om våre spillere. Vi gjør dette for å tillate bransjeanalyse, demografisk profilering, markedsføring, analyse, annonsering og andre forretningsformål.

 _Vi kan dele informasjon for å oppfylle våre rettslige forpliktelser og overholde rettshåndhevelse._

Dette kan også inkludere innsats for å forhindre svindel, for å bistå med reduksjon av kredittrisiko og andre sikkerhetstiltak. Denne fremleggingen vil være etter vårt eget skjønn;_
* _Når vi har grunn til å tro at det er en nødsituasjon som utgjør en trussel mot helse og/eller sikkerhet for enhver person, inkludert våre brukere, ansatte eller allmennheten generelt. Denne fremleggingen vil være etter vårt eget skjønn;_
* _For å beskytte Playtikas og andre tredjeparters rettigheter eller eiendom, inkludert håndhevelse av våre [tjenestevilkår](https://playtika.com/terms-service)._

#### ANNONSERING OG MARKEDSFØRING

Vi kan bruke og dele med våre tjenesteleverandører og forretningspartnere informasjon som enhetsidentifikatorer og hendelser i spillet for å kjøre, måle og optimalisere våre markedsføringskampanjer (for eksempel, vise annonser for våre tjenester på andre nettsider eller apper).

I tillegg inkluderer noen av våre tjenester annonser fra tredjeparts annonsører. Disse annonsørene kan samle inn og dele noe informasjon, som hvorvidt du klikker på annonsen, for å bistå med funksjonalitet og målretting av annonser.

Vi registrerer om du har samtykket til å motta reklame- og markedsføringskommunikasjon fra oss. Hvis du har samtykket til å motta markedsføringskommunikasjon fra oss per e-post eller tekstmeldinger for eksempel, vil vi bruke opplysninger vi har samlet inn om deg og interessene dine samt din kontaktinformasjon for å sende deg vårt markedsføringsmateriale. Noe av dette markedsføringsmaterialet kan også leveres gjennom våre apper eller varsler i spillet.

[**Mer informasjon +**](#Section14)

#### REKLAME

_For å hjelpe til med funksjonaliteten til og tilpasse annonsene du ser på vår tjeneste, samt kjøre, måle og optimalisere våre egne markedsføringskampanjer og utføre ytelsesanalyser, kan våre annonsepartnere samle inn (eller vi kan dele med dem) følgende typer informasjon:_

* _Informasjon om annonseresultat (som antall klikk på en annonse);_
* _Samlet/avidentifisert informasjon om spillere som er ment å hjelpe med å hjelpe målrettede annonser, men ikke direkte identifisere personer (for eksempel at en spiller er mellom 45 og 65 år og bor i Miami);_
* _Teknisk informasjon om enheten som er brukt, slik som IP-adresser, IDFA-er, GAID-er og andre enhetsidentifikatorer;_
* _Spillaktivitet og spillhendelser, slik som nivået ditt i et spill og utførte kjøp; og_
* _Dine identifikatorer for sosiale medier._

_Noe av informasjonen kan være samlet inn via informasjonskapsler og annen sporingsteknologi. Våre annonsører kan bruke flere typer av sporingsteknologi samtidig._

_Hvis du klikker på en annonse, kan du bli videreført til en tredjeparts app eller nettside som kanskje ikke ligger på en side eller app eid eller drevet av Playtika. Hvis du spiller via en tredjepartsplattform, som for eksempel en sosial media-plattform, kan det å klikke på en annonse omdirigere deg til en tredjepartsplattform som ikke lenger er drevet av sosial media-plattformen eller Playtika._

#### AVSTÅ FRA E-POSTER OG PUSH-VARSLER

_Hvis du ønsker å avstå fra fremmende eller markedsføringskommunikasjon fra Playtika kan du gjøre dette ved å:_

* _Klikk på «stopp abonnement» i en salgsfremmende e-post fra en spesifikk Playtika-tjeneste for å endre og oppdatere dine kontaktpreferanser for e-poster fra oss (merk at vi fortsatt kan kontakte deg via e-post i forbindelse med din konto, for eksempel for tilbakestilling av passord eller annen kontostyring);_

_Hvis du ønsker å avstå fra push-varsler fra Playtika kan du gjøre dette ved å:_

* _Endre innstillingene i dine sosiale media-plattformer for å slå av varsler fra Playtika via disse plattformene. For eksempel ved å slå av varsler fra Playtika på Facebook; og_
* _Endre innstillingene på din enhet og/eller nettleser for å slå av push-varsler fra vår tjeneste. I noen av våre apper har vi også mulighet til å deaktivere push-varsler i spillets innstillinger._

#### VELGE BORT TILPASSET ANNONSERING

_

Avhengig av hvor du bor og bruker tjenestene våre fra, kan du ha en rettighet i forhold til å velge bort tilpasset annonsering fra tredjepart. I tilfelle du velger bort tilpasset annonsering fra tredjepart tilbyr vi en bryter i våre appers innstillinger slik at du når som helst kan deaktivere disse annonsene.

Du kan også velge bort tilpasset annonsering ved å justere sporingsinnstillingene for annonsering på din(e) enhet(er). Dette kan gjøres ved å tilbakestille annonseringsidentifikatoren på din enhet (slik som IDFA-en) eller du kan kanskje laste ned apper, slik som Digital Advertising Alliance’s «AppChoices» app, som kan hjelpe deg med å kontrollere innsamling og bruk av informasjon på tvers av apper for tilpasset annonsering.

Tredjeparts bortvalgsverktøy som AppChoices-appen drives og eies uavhengig. Playtika kontrollerer, driver eller godkjenner ikke disse verktøyene eller valgene som annonsører og andre gir gjennom disse verktøyene. De er kun oppført her som en bekvemmelighet for spillere.

Playtika svarer for øyeblikket ikke på «Ikke spor»-signaler på noen av plattformene som kjører våre tjenester.

Vær oppmerksom på at du fortsatt kan motta annonser fra Playtika og tredjeparter i Playtikas spill selv om du velger bort tilpasset annonsering, men disse annonsene vil ikke være tilpasset til deg.

Lover varierer fra jurisdiksjon til jurisdiksjon, så lover for databeskyttelse og personvern som gjelder for stedene hvor informasjon overføres til eller lagres, brukes eller behandles i, kan være forskjellig fra lovene der du bor. Når vi overfører informasjon utenfor stedet hvor den ble samlet inn, iverksetter vi egnede sikkerhetstiltak eller gjør en innsats for å sikre at slike overføringer oppfyller gjeldende lokale lovkrav. Hvis du vil vite mer om Playtikas internasjonale overføringer, kan du bruke Kontakt oss-delen under.

#### BARN

Vi er forpliktet til å overholde barnevernslover. I noen av spillene våre bruker vi aldersportaler for å forhindre at barn får tilgang til tjenestene våre. Noen av spillene våre (inkludert Best Fiends og Best Fiends Stars) har versjoner med begrenset tilgang som vi gjør tilgjengelige når barn prøver å spille eller sette opp en konto, disse har begrensede spillfunksjoner og databehandling.

[**Mer informasjon +**](#Section24)

#### HVOR GAMMEL MÅ JEG VÆRE FOR Å SPILLE?

_Playtikas [tjenestevilkår](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) begrenser bruk av noen av spillene våre av brukere under en viss alder (avhengig av spillet du spiller og loven hvor du oppholder deg). I noen spill kan vi begrense innsamling av opplysninger på tjenestene fra noen, bruke en aldersportal som lar barn bruke tjenestene mens innsamling av opplysninger fra barn begrenses, eller krever en forelders eller verges tillatelse._

_Vi anbefaler at du går gjennom våre [tjenestevilkår](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) for flere detaljer om aldersretningslinjer og begrensinger på tjenesten vår._

#### HVA ER EN ALDERSPORTAL, OG HVORDAN FUNGERER DEN?

_

En aldersportal er et system som kan brukes for å forhindre brukere under en viss alder fra å få tilgang til apper og nettsider, eller for å sikre at forskjellige aldersgrupper får en passende opplevelse.

Hvis du spiller et spill med en aldersportal, vil en popup vises som ber deg oppgi opplysninger om alderen. Disse opplysningene brukes kun til å bekrefte at du er gammel nok til å spille spillet.

_

#### BARNET MITT SPILLER ET Playtika-SPILL

_

_Playtika selger ikke eller deler informasjon om forbrukere under 16 år for formål knyttet til tverr-kontekstuell atferdsreklame. Vi kan avidentifisere opplysninger for analyse- og reklameformål, i så fall vil vi ikke forsøke å reidentifisere opplysningene._

_**Merknad om økonomisk insentiv**. Vi tilbyr insentiver som f.eks. et belønningsprogram som gir visse gode, f.eks. belønninger og eksklusive tilbud, samt andre programmer som lotterier eller konkurranser. For disse programmenes formål kan vi samle inn navn og kontaktinformasjon samt opplysninger om din bruk av tjenestene. Vi kan oppgi, selge eller dele disse opplysningene som beskrevet over. Disse insentivene eller programmene kan anses som et «økonomisk insentiv» eller et «bona fide lojalitetsprogram» i henhold til amerikanske personvernlover._

_Hvis vi lovpålegges å tildele verdi til opplysningene vi får gjennom slike programmer, vil vi vurdere opplysningene som samles inn og brukes basert på verdien av å dele fremtidige tilbud tilpasset dine interesser, verdien av disse kan avhenge av kategoriene av innsamlede opplysninger og produktet som tilbys eller fremmes._

_Deltakelse i ethvert insentivprogram er frivillig, og ved å registrere deg for ett, samtykker du til innsamling, bruk og deling av dine opplysninger i forbindelse med programmet. Hvis du senere ønsker å trekke samtykket ditt, kan du gjøre det ved å kontakte oss eller følge instruksjonene angitt i vilkårene og betingelsene for det spesifikke programmet, hvis aktuelt._

_Merk at hvis du velger å avstå fra salg eller deling av dine opplysninger eller bruk av dine opplysninger for målrettet annonsering, vil din deltakelse i programmene våre ikke påvirkes, og du vil fortsette å motta alle fordelene du har rett til. Hvis du imidlertid ber om å få slettet alle opplysningene dine, vil vi ikke lenger kunne gi deg noen programfordeler da vi ikke vil kunne koble deg til fordelene du hadde rett til, eller kontakte deg angående dem._

#### INFORMASJONSKAPSLER OG ANNEN TEKNOLOGI

Vi kan bruke informasjonskapsler og annen teknologi til å samle inn opplysninger om hvordan du bruker tjenesten og nettsiden vår for å assistere deg med ting som å forbedre tjenesten vår og målrette reklamen vår.

Vi kan også bruke teknologi inkludert kunstig intelligens («KI») for andre formål, som å levere nye funksjoner eller assistere med våre tjenestefunksjoner.

[**Mer informasjon +**](#Section30)

#### INFORMASJONSKAPSLER OG LIGNENDE TEKNOLOGI

_En informasjonskapsel er en liten datafil som overføres til enheten din for registreringsformål. Opplysningene på en informasjonskapsel kan knyttes til opplysninger som f.eks. din surfeaktivitet. Vi kan plassere informasjonskapsler på enheten din og bruke dem for formål som å forbedre kvaliteten på tjenesten vår, gjøre tjenesten enklere å bruke, og levere målrettede annonser. Tredjeparts annonsører og tjenesteleverandører kan også bruke, plassere eller lese informasjonskapsler eller annen teknologi som beskrevet under på enheten din, og disse metodene er underlagt egne retningslinjer._

_Det finnes to typer informasjonskapsler: Essensielle informasjonskapsler og ikke-essensielle informasjonskapsler. Vi bruker essensielle informasjonskapsler til å skille deg fra andre brukere på Playtika-nettsiden, og for å drive nettsiden vår korrekt._

_Du kan blokkere alle informasjonskapsler, inkludert essensielle informasjonskapsler, ved å sette opp nettleserne dine eller bruke tredjeparts plug-ins for å advare deg mot forsøk på å plassere informasjonskapsler på enheten din eller begrense typen informasjonskapsler du tillater plassert på enheten din._

_På Playtika-nettsider som bruker informasjonskapsler, kan du tilpasse innstillingene og samtykkene for informasjonskapsler via informasjonskapselbanneret på ditt første besøk til nettsiden, eller klikke på «Innstillinger for informasjonskapsler» i bunnteksten på nettsiden eller informasjonskapsel-widgeten for å endre preferansene dine når som helst._

_Merk at hvis du deaktiverer informasjonskapsler, kan du miste noen av funksjonene for tjenesten vår. Playtika svarer for tiden ikke på Do Not Track-signaler, uansett om det signalet er mottatt på en datamaskin eller en mobil enhet._

_Vi kan også bruke annen lignende teknologi, inkludert:_

* _pikseltagger, som kan la oss vite når en viss side besøkes eller hvorvidt en e-post ble åpnet;_
* _annonseidentifikatorer, som reklame-ID for Android og Apple kalt IDFA eller GAID, som kobles til enheten din og kan tilbakestilles på enheten din;_
* _sporingspiksler, som kan la oss eller våre annonseringspartnere annonsere mer effektivt ved å gjenkjenne enheten(e) din(e) på, utenfor og på kryss av forskjellige tjenester og enheter og identifisere kilden for en ny installasjon; og_
* _lokalt delte objekter, også kalt flash cookies, som kan hjelpe oss med å redusere svindel, huske dine preferanser i spill, og fremskynde innlastingstider._

_Vi kan bruke Google Analytics, Facebook Audience Insights, og/eller lignende tjenester fra tredjeparter som samler inn informasjon om din atferd og demografi. For mer informasjon om Google Analytics, se nettsiden deres ([www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)), hvor du kan avmelde deg Googles innsamling og behandling av informasjon._

_Vi kan bruke Flash informasjonskapsler, som drives annerledes enn informasjonskapsler i nettleser. For å lære mer om og styre flash informasjonskapsler kan du besøke Adobe nettside og gjøre endringer på det globale panelet for personverninnstillinger._

#### KUNSTIG INTELLIGENS

_

Vi kan bruke teknologier som (a) kan anses som automatisk beslutningstaking eller profilering, og/eller (b) inkluderer behandling av informasjon som del av opplæring, testing og bruk av kunstig intelligens (teknologi som etterligner intelligent menneskelig atferd) for å evaluere informasjon som vi samler inn (inkludert, for eksempel, aktivitet i spillet og kommunikasjon innenfor tjenesten vår) for å forbedre vår tjeneste. For eksempel for å tilrettelegge kundestøtteprosesser, gjennomføre undersøke, tilpasse tjenesten vår til dine preferanser og andre legitime forretningsformål.

_

#### DINE RETTIGHETER

Avhengig av hvor du bor og får tilgang til tjenestene våre fra, kan du ha rettigheter i forhold til informasjonen vi har om deg og hvordan vi bruker den. Du kan når som helst utøve disse rettighetene ved å bruke kontaktinformasjonen og metodene i avsnittet Kontakt oss nedenfor.

* _Klager_
    * _Du kan ha rett til å klage til kompetent myndighet i din jurisdiksjon på hvordan vi behandler din informasjon._
    * _Innbyggere i visse amerikanske stater har rett til å klage på alle avgjørelser vi tar angående deres informasjon og hvis de ikke er fornøyd med svaret vårt, så kan de klage til statsadvokaten i sin stat._
* _Korrigering eller rektifisering_
    * _Hvis noe av informasjonen vi har om deg er feil eller ufullstendig, så kan du ha rett til å be oss om å korrigere den._

    * _Under visse omstendigheter kan du ha rett til å be om at vi sletter den informasjonen vi har om deg._

    * _Under visse omstendigheter kan du ha rett til å protestere på behandlingen av din informasjon._
    * _Innbyggere i visse amerikanske stater kan ha rett til å velge bort salg eller deling av deres personopplysninger for atferdsreklame på tvers av kontekster, eller bruk av deres informasjon for målrettet annonsering eller profilering for å fremme avgjørelser som gir juridiske eller lignende betydelige effekter for forbrukeren._
* _Portabilitet eller kopier_
    * _Under visse omstendigheter kan du ha rett til å be oss om å overføre din informasjon til en annen organisasjon eller til deg i et tilgjengelig format._
* _Begrensning av behandling_
    * _Under visse omstendigheter kan du ha rett til å begrense hvordan vi behandler din informasjon._

_Hvis du ønsker å utøve noen av dine rettigheter i forhold til din informasjon, kontakt oss ved bruk av detaljene i avsnittet Kontakt oss nedenfor. Vi vil besvare din forespørsel i tråd med eventuelle frister som er pålagt ved lov. Playtika vil ikke diskriminere deg for å utøve noen av disse rettighetene._

_Hvis du har noen spørsmål om rettighetene du har, se veiledningen til ditt lokale databeskyttelseskontor. Alternativt kan du kontakte oss ved å se avsnittet Kontakt oss nedenfor._

_Før vi etterkommer en forespørsel fra deg kan vi be om informasjon, dokumenter eller annet bevis fra deg for å bekrefte din identitet. Hvis du ikke kan gi oss det beviset vi krever, så kan det hende at vi ikke kan etterkomme din forespørsel. Vi opererer på dette grunnlaget for å forhindre bedragersk, ondsinnet eller på annen måte ugunstig avsløring, sletting eller annen aktivitet i forhold til din informasjon. Noen jurisdiksjoner lar deg sende inn din forespørsel gjennom en autorisert agent som opptrer på dine vegne. Vi kan kreve at agenter leverer bekreftelse på at de opptrer på dine vegne._

_I USA er det forskjellige måter for å sende inn en fravalgsforespørsel. For detaljer, se avsnittet ovenfor som er kalt Velge bort tilpasset annonsering. I tillegg, avhengig av din bostedsstat, kan du også ha rett til å sende inn en fravalgsforespørsel via Global Privacy Control («GPC»)-signalet. GPC-signalet overholdes kun på enhetsnivå._

#### VARFÖR SAMLAR VI IN INFORMATION? VAD GÖR VI MED DEN?

_

Vi samlar in information i flera syften, inklusive för att skapa ditt konto, ge dig en personlig spelupplevelse, möjliggöra köp i spel samt för att kunna erbjuda teknisk support. Vi kan också samla in information för att låta dig komma i kontakt och kommunicera med vänner i appen, anpassa annonsering efter dina intressen samt för att tillhandahålla, förbättra och optimera tjänsterna, evenemangen och marknadsföringen. Nedan hittar du mer information om några av dessa syften.

Playtika samlar bara in och använder information när det är tillåtet enligt lag. De olika rättsliga grunderna för oss att samla in och använda information beror på lagarna som gäller där du är baserad eller bor och använder Playtika-tjänsterna. De vanligaste rättsliga grunderna gällande insamling och användning av information är när:

* du har gett oss ditt samtycke
* det är nödvändigt för att fullgöra våra avtalsenliga skyldigheter gentemot dig
* det är nödvändigt för att tillgodose vårt eller en tredje parts legitima intresse om det inte strider mot dina grundläggande rättigheter
* det är nödvändigt för att följa lagar och regler.

**Kontoregistrering och -underhåll**

Vi kan använda information för att konfigurera och registrera ett spelkonto eller logga in för att skapa ett konto med olika metoder. Vi kan också använda information för att hantera ditt konto, till exempel för att vi ska kunna skydda kontot, verifiera din identitet och upprätthålla kontofunktionen (inklusive Playtika Rewards).

Vi använder även kontoinformation (integrerade sociala medier och konton som är registrerade direkt hos Playtika) för att upprätthålla säkerheten och spelanvändning över flera plattformar och/eller enheter.

**Spelande**

Vi använder information för att kunna optimera våra spel och erbjuda dem till dig. Detta inkluderar användning av information om ditt spelande och dina köp för att personanpassa våra spel efter dig, vilket kan ske i form av gåvor i spelet, kampanjer och funktioner i spelet. Vi använder dessa parametrar för att vi anser att de ger oss en uppfattning om (till exempel) din engagemangnivå när det kommer till våra spel. Därutöver aggregerar vi din information med information om andra spelare som har liknande bakgrund eller spelmönster. Det gör vi för att säkerställa att alla spelare får en trevlig och optimal upplevelse.

Vi använder information om ditt spelande för att spåra ditt förlopp. Sådan information kan vi dela med tredje parter för att vi och/eller de ska kunna erbjuda belöningar och incitament som är relevanta och intressanta för dig och ditt spelande.

**Köp i spel**

Vi använder information om genomförda betalningar (genom våra betalningsprocessorer) för att behandla din betalning och kreditera ditt konto med virtuella föremål som du köper. 

**Kundsupport och kontohantering**

Vi kan använda information för att tillhandahålla support till dig direkt, eller för att hjälpa till med mer allmän support för tjänsten, till exempel buggfixar. Om du uppger din information via ett serviceärende, använder vårt supportteam den för att hjälpa dig.

Vi kan också använda information om ditt konto för att förbättra din upplevelse hos Playtika, inklusive att tilldela dig en kontoansvarig. Kontoansvariga kan använda information som du tillhandahåller för att hjälpa till med affärshantering, inklusive att ta emot din feedback om Playtika-spel, nya funktioner och din spelupplevelse. De kan också använda den här informationen för att bjuda in dig till evenemang.

**Sociala funktioner och chattfunktioner**

Vissa av våra spel har sociala funktioner och chattfunktioner. Vi kan behandla information i syfte att kunna erbjuda dessa funktioner och låta dig interagera med familj och vänner. En del av informationen vi samlar in eller behandlar kan vi ha fått från tredjepartsplattformar såsom Facebook. Du hittar mer information om datadelning för sociala medier i profilinställningarna samt i integritetspolicyn för respektive plattform.

**Annonsering**

Vi kan använda information i syfte att integrera annonsering med de av våra spel som innehåller reklam. Vi kan också dela din information med tredje parter, däribland våra annonseringspartner, i syfte att göra annonserna funktionella och riktade. Mer information om hur vi använder din information för annonsering finns under avsnittet Annonsering och marknadsföring i den här policyn.

**Evenemang**

Vi kan komma att använda information som vi samlar in i samband med våra evenemang till att planera framtida evenemang och kampanjer eller i interaktionen mellan dig och en kontoansvarig.

**Affärshantering**

Vi kan använda information om dig och ditt spelande för att underlätta vår affärshantering och -planering. Till exempel ger detta oss en indikation på hur användare interagerar med vår tjänst och hur Playtika kan ta fram och förbättra spel för våra användare samt i marknadsföringssyften.

_

#### HUR VI DELAR INFORMATION

För att tillhandahålla våra tjänster till dig, kan vi dela information om dig inom Playtika, eller med våra tjänsteleverantörer och affärspartner i analys- och marknadsföringssyften eller för andra ändamål. Vissa av dina personuppgifter kan vara tillgängliga för andra användare, till exempel informationen om din spelarprofil.

[**Mer information +**](#Section8)

#### INFORMATION SOM ÄR TILLGÄNGLIG FÖR ANDRA ANVÄNDARE

_

Du kan välja att uppge information om dig själv när du använder våra tjänster genom att bidra till eller komma åt chattrum, bloggar, anslagstavlor, spelarprofiler eller liknande funktioner. Vissa av dessa funktioner kan också innebära integrering med tredjepartssidor eller -tjänster för att du ska kunna kommunicera med andra spelare (till exempel via privata meddelanden eller e-post).

Playtika och användare av Playtika kan eventuellt komma åt, läsa, titta på, samla in och använda information som du uppger via dessa funktioner, inklusive foton och videor. Playtika ansvarar inte för någon information som du väljer att offentliggöra eller dela på ditt konto. Se våra [Användarvillkor](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) för vägledning och information om att publicera innehåll genom vår tjänst.

För vissa av de sociala funktionerna i vår tjänst kan du importera eller manuellt ange information om vänner och familj, så att du kan komma i kontakt med dem på vår tjänst eller bjuda in dem till att använda tjänsterna.

Vissa sociala funktioner som är tillgängliga där du spelar, registrerar dig eller loggar in via ett konto på sociala medier kan dela detaljer om din Playtika-aktivitet, till exempel ditt spelande, namn och profilbild, med dina kontakter eller vänner på sociala medier. På liknande sätt, om du använder vår tjänst efter att ha fått en inbjudan från en annan spelare via sociala medier, kan den spelaren se information om dig och ditt spelande, till exempel när du registrerar dig samt uppnådda nivåer.

I många av Playtika-spelen kan andra spelare se information om ditt spelande, kommunicera med dig och se din användarprofil och information som är tillgänglig på den. Andra spelare kan eventuellt skicka spelförfrågningar eller förfrågningar om sociala konton till dig om du väljer att integrera några av dina sociala mediekonton och/eller Playtika-kommunikationskanaler.

_

#### TJÄNSTELEVERANTÖRER FRÅN TREDJE PART OCH AFFÄRSPARTNER

_

Playtika använder oberoende företag för att stödja tjänsten vi tillhandahåller, till exempel för att hjälpa oss med betalningshantering, analysera information, optimera spelupplevelsen och förbättra upplevelsen för spelare, e-postleverans, värdtjänster, evenemangstjänster, säkerhetstjänster, driva våra marknadsföringskampanjer samt hantera och leverera kontextuell och anpassad reklam.

_

#### FÖRSÄLJNING ELLER SAMMANSLAGNING

_

Om Playtika skulle ansöka om eller genomgå omstrukturering av något slag, inklusive försäljning, köp, sammanslagning med och/eller förvärv av ett annat företag, eller av någon Playtika-tillgång, kan vi lämna ut relevant information vi har till de andra organisationerna som är involverade i övergången. Vi kommer att göra rimliga ansträngningar för att informera dig om detta ifall det skulle inträffa samt hur det påverkar din information i den utsträckning lagen kräver det.

_

#### PUBLICITET OCH MARKNADSANALYS

_

Vi kan också publicera aggregerad och analytisk information (sammanslagen information om dig och andra spelare som inte är avsedd att specifikt identifiera någon enskild spelare, till exempel spelare i åldersintervallet 25 till 50 år som bor i USA) och annan anonymiserad information om våra spelare. Vi gör detta för att möjliggöra och underlätta branschanalyser, demografisk profilering, marknadsföring, analys och annonsering samt för andra affärsändamål.

_

#### JURIDISKA SKYLDIGHETER OCH EFTERLEVNAD

 _Vi kan dela information för att fullgöra våra juridiska skyldigheter och följa brottsbekämpande myndigheters krav._

_Vi kan dela information bland annat i följande fall:_

* _när vi väljer att avslöja information i god tro som svar på förfrågningar från offentliga myndigheter, inklusive för att uppfylla lagstadgade krav eller krav gällande nationell säkerhet samt i anslutning till ett rättsligt förfarande (till exempel ett domstolsbeslut, en husrannsakan eller stämning)_
* _för att följa lagar, förordningar eller obligatoriska uppförandekoder om dessa kräver att vi avslöjar information som vi samlar in_
* _när vi har anledning att tro att någon använder vår tjänst för att begå brott, kan vi dela information för att anmäla och utreda misstänkt brottslighet eller informera andra företag och organisationer så att dessa kan förebygga, anmäla eller utreda misstänkt brottslighet – detta kan även innebära ansträngningar att förhindra bedrägeri, hjälpa till att minimera kreditrisker och andra säkerhetsförsiktighetsåtgärder. Sådan utlämning sker helt efter vårt eget gottfinnande._
* _när vi har anledning att tro att en nödsituation föreligger som kan utgöra ett hot mot någons hälsa och/eller säkerhet, inklusive våra användares, anställdas eller allmänhetens. Sådan utlämning sker helt efter vårt eget gottfinnande._
* _för att skydda rättigheter eller egendom som tillhör Playtika och andra tredje parter, inklusive för att verkställa våra [användarvillkor](https://playtika.com/terms-service)._

#### ANNONSERING OCH MARKNADSFÖRING

Vi kan använda och dela viss information med våra tjänsteleverantörer och affärspartner, bland annat enhetsidentifierare och spelevenemang för att köra, mäta och optimera våra marknadsföringskampanjer (till exempel visa annonser för våra tjänster på andra webbplatser eller appar).

Dessutom innehåller vissa av våra tjänster annonser från tredjepartsannonsörer. Dessa annonsörer kan hämta in och dela viss information, till exempel huruvida du klickar på annonsen, för att göra annonser funktionella och riktade.

Vi registrerar huruvida du har samtyckt till att ta emot kampanj- och marknadsföringskommunikation från oss. Om du har samtyckt till att ta emot marknadsföringskommunikation från oss per e-post eller SMS till exempel, kommer vi att använda vår insamlade information om dig och dina intressen såväl som din kontaktinformation för att skicka marknadsföringsmaterial till dig. Du kan eventuellt få en del av vårt marknadsföringsmaterial via våra appar eller som spelaviseringar.

[**Mer information +**](#Section14)

#### ANNONSERING

_För att annonserna du ser på våra tjänster ska fungera och vara anpassade efter dig, samt för att vi ska kunna köra, mäta och optimera våra marknadsföringskampanjer och analysera resultat, kan våra annonseringspartner samla in (eller så kan vi dela med dem) följande typer av information:_

* _information om annonsresultat (såsom antalet klick på en annons)_
* _aggregerad/avidentifierad information om spelare som är avsedd att hjälpa till att rikta annonser men inte direkt identifiera individer (till exempel att en spelare är mellan 45 och 65 år gammal och bor i Miami)_
* _teknisk information om den använda enheten, såsom IP-adresser, IDFA, GAID och andra enhetsidentifierare_
* _spelaktivitet och spelhändelser, såsom din nivå inom ett spel och genomförda köp_
* _dina sociala medier-identifierare._

_Viss information kan samlas in via kakor och annan spårningsteknik. Våra annonsörer kan använda flera former av spårningsteknik samtidigt._

_Om du klickar på en annons, kan du bli omdirigerad till en tredjepartsapp eller -webbplats som Playtika eventuellt inte äger eller driver. Om du spelar via en tredjepartsplattform – till exempel via sociala medier – och klickar på en annons, kan du bli omdirigerad till en tredjepartsplattform som varken den sociala medieleverantören eller Playtika hostar._

#### AVANMÄLAN FRÅN E-POSTMEDDELANDEN OCH PUSHNOTISER

Om du vill avanmäla dig från kampanj- eller marknadsföringskommunikation från Playtika kan du göra det genom att:

* klicka på ”Avprenumerera” i ett reklam-e-postmeddelande från en specifik Playtika-tjänst för att ändra och uppdatera dina kontaktpreferenser för e-postmeddelanden från oss (observera att vi fortfarande kan kontakta dig via e-post i samband med ditt konto, till exempel för lösenordsåterställningar eller annan kontohantering)

Om du vill avanmäla dig från pushnotiser från Playtika kan du göra det genom att:

* ändra inställningarna i dina sociala medieplattformar för att stänga av notiser från Playtika via dessa plattformar, till exempel genom att inaktivera aviseringar från Playtika på Facebook
* ändra inställningarna på din enhet och/eller i din webbläsare för att inaktivera pushnotiser från vår tjänst. I vissa av våra appar finns det ett alternativ för att inaktivera pushnotiser i spelinställningarna.

#### AVANMÄLAN FRÅN ANPASSAD ANNONSERING

_

Beroende på var du bor och varifrån du kommer åt våra tjänster, kan du ha rätt att avanmäla dig från anpassad tredjepartsannonsering. I sådana fall, om du vill avanmäla dig från anpassad tredjepartsannonsering, kan du när som helst göra det med det avsedda reglaget i appinställningarna.

Du kan också avanmäla dig från anpassad annonsering genom att ändra inställningarna för annonseringsspårning på din enhet. Du kan göra detta genom att återställa annonsidentifieraren på din enhet (såsom IDFA), eller så kan du ladda ner appar, såsom Digital Advertising Alliances ”AppChoices”-app, som kan hjälpa dig att styra insamlingen och användningen av information mellan appar för anpassad annonsering.

Vi varken ansvarar för eller äger tredjepartsverktyg för avanmälan (till exempel AppChoices-appen). Playtika varken styr, driver eller stöder dessa verktyg eller de val som annonsörer och andra tillhandahåller genom dessa verktyg. De anges här enbart av bekvämlighetsskäl för spelaren.

Playtika besvarar för närvarande inte några ”Do Not Track”-signaler från de plattformar som kör vår tjänst.

Observera att du fortfarande kan komma att ta emot annonser från Playtika och tredje parter inom Playtikas spel även om du avanmäler dig från anpassad annonsering. Skillnaden är att dessa annonser inte är anpassade efter dig.

_

#### ALLMÄNT

Det här avsnittet innehåller ytterligare information om hur vi tar hand om din information, inklusive hur vi håller din information säker, hur länge vi behåller din information och under vilka omständigheter vi kan överföra din information internationellt.

[**Mer information +**](#Section18)

#### INTERNATIONELLA ÖVERFÖRINGAR

_

Playtika kan skicka, få åtkomst till, använda och/eller lagra information utanför det land eller den region där du bor, till exempel i USA och Israel. Vi kan föra över information till våra dotterbolag, tjänsteleverantörer, affärspartner och andra som vi nämner i denna policy.

Lagar varierar mellan jurisdiktioner, vilket innebär att tillämpliga dataskydds- och integritetslagar i länder dit vi för över information eller där vi lagrar, använder eller behandlar information, kan skilja sig från lagarna där du bor. När vi för över information utanför inhämtningsplatsen, vidtar vi lämpliga säkerhetsåtgärder eller på annat sätt gör ansträngningar för att säkerställa att sådana överföringar uppfyller tillämpliga lokala lagstadgade krav. Se avsnittet Kontakta oss nedan om du vill veta mer om Playtikas internationella överföringar.

_

#### KVARHÅLLANDE AV INFORMATION

_

Vi kan behålla information så länge du använder vår tjänst och så länge det är nödvändigt för att uppfylla syftena med insamlingen, eller efter behov för att uppfylla våra legitima affärssyften och följa tillämpliga lagar; för att fullgöra våra skyldigheter enligt förordningar eller gällande bokföring och rapportering; för att lösa tvister; för att skydda våra tillgångar; för att effektivt bedriva vår verksamhet; och för att verkställa våra avtal.

_

#### INFORMATIONSSÄKERHET

_

Playtika vidtar rimliga åtgärder för att skydda din information, inklusive inför lämpliga tekniska och organisatoriska åtgärder för att säkerställa en riskanpassad säkerhetsnivå.

_

#### LÄMNA Playtika-TJÄNSTER VIA LÄNKAR TILL ANDRA WEBBPLATSER/APPAR

_

Vår tjänst kan innehålla länkar till andra webbplatser och/eller appar som tredje parter äger och/eller tillhandahåller.

All information du tillhandahåller till tjänster som inte ägs eller drivs av Playtika kommer att omfattas av integritetspolicyn på den webbplats eller app du har besökt, och vi ansvarar inte för innehållet, integritetspolicyn, användarvillkoren eller säkerhetspraxisen på den externa webbplatsen och/eller appen. Du bör läsa igenom villkoren och integritetspolicyn för alla webbplatser och appar du besöker.

_

#### UPPDATERINGAR AV DEN HÄR INTEGRITETSPOLICYN

_

_Vi förbehåller oss rätten att ändra integritetspolicyn från tid till annan och uppmanar dig att regelbundet kontrollera Playtikas integritetsmeddelande avseende ändringar._

_Om vi gör några ändringar i integritetspolicyn, informerar vi dig på lämpligt sätt. Om vi är skyldiga enligt lag kommer vi att skicka ett meddelande till din registrerade e-postadress eller via en popup-ruta i spelet. Vi kan även publicera meddelanden i bloggar, på sociala nätverk och/eller forum samt andra Playtika-webbplatser för att förtydliga. Dock rekommenderar vi att du regelbundet kontrollerar [www.Playtika.com](http://www.playtika.com/) och denna integritetspolicy avseende ändringar._

_

#### BARN

Vi följer alla barnskyddslagar. I vissa av våra spel använder vi en så kallad ”age gate” för att förhindra att barn kan komma åt våra tjänster. Några av våra spel (däribland Best Fiends och Best Fiends Stars) har begränsade åtkomstversioner som vi gör tillgängliga när barn försöker spela eller skapa ett konto. Dessa har begränsade spelfunktioner och begränsad databehandling.

[**Mer information +**](#Section24)

#### HUR GAMMAL MÅSTE JAG VARA FÖR ATT FÅ SPELA?

_Playtikas [användarvillkor](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) begränsar användningen av vissa av våra spel för användare under en viss ålder (beroende på spelet du spelar och lagstiftningen där du bor). I vissa spel kan vi begränsa insamlingen av information på tjänsterna från alla användare, tillämpa en ”age gate” som gör det möjligt för barn att använda tjänsterna samtidigt som insamlingen av information från barn begränsas, eller kräva en förälders eller vårdnadshavares tillstånd för att samla in information från barn._

_Vi rekommenderar att du läser våra [användarvillkor](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) för att ta reda på mer om riktlinjer och åldersgränser för vår tjänst._

#### VAD ÄR EN ”AGE GATE” OCH HUR FUNGERAR DET?

_

En ”age gate” är ett system som kan förhindra att användare under en viss ålder kommer åt appar och webbplatser. En ”age gate” kan dessutom ge olika åldersgrupper en lämplig, anpassad upplevelse.

Om du spelar ett spel som har en ”age gate”, kommer du att se en popup-ruta som ber dig att uppge information om din ålder. Vi använder bara den här informationen för att verifiera att du är tillräckligt gammal för att spela spelet.

_

#### MITT BARN SPELAR ETT Playtika-SPEL

_Playtika har åtagit sig att följa lagar som skyddar barn. Kontakta oss på [\[email protected\]](https://www.playtika.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) om du tror att ditt barn har skickat in data till Playtika eller spelar ett Playtika-spel i strid mot våra användarvillkor och/eller utan ditt samtycke. Vi vidtar rimliga åtgärder för att radera sådan information så snart som möjligt._

#### BOSATTA I USA

Utöver villkoren i denna integritetspolicy, kräver vissa statliga lagar i USA att amerikanska medborgare får ta del av utökad information om hur vi hanterar sekretess. Klicka på Mer information om du är medborgare i USA och vill veta alla villkor som gäller för dig.

[**Mer information +**](#Section25)

_Playtika säljer eller delar inte information om konsumenter under 16 år för syften som rör beteendebaserad annonsering över olika sammanhang. Vi kan avidentifiera information för analys- och annonseringssyften, i vilket fall vi inte kommer att försöka återidentifiera informationen._

_**Meddelande om ekonomiskt incitament.** Vi erbjuder incitament, däribland ett belöningsprogram som ger vissa fördelar – till exempel belöningar och exklusiva erbjudanden – såväl som utlottningar och tävlingar. För dessa ändamål kan vi samla in ditt namn och din kontaktinformation samt information om din användning av tjänsterna. Vi kan komma att avslöja, sälja eller dela informationen i enlighet med denna integritetspolicy. Dessa incitament eller program kan anses vara ett ”ekonomiskt incitament” eller ”bona fide-lojalitetsprogram” enligt statliga integritetslagar i USA._

_Om vi är skyldiga enligt lag att värdera informationen vi samlar in genom sådana program, kommer vi att värdera den insamlade informationen utifrån värdet av att dela framtida erbjudanden som är anpassade efter dina intressen, vilket kan bero på kategorierna av insamlad information och den erbjudna eller marknadsförda produkten._

_Deltagande i incitamentprogram är valfritt. När du anmäler dig till ett incitamentprogram samtycker du till insamlingen, användningen och avslöjandet av din information i anslutning till programmet. Om du senare vill återkalla ditt samtycke kan du göra det genom att kontakta oss eller följa instruktionerna i programvillkoren, i tillämpliga fall._

_Observera: om du väljer att avanmäla dig från försäljning eller delning av din information eller användning av din information för riktad annonsering, påverkar det inte ditt deltagande i våra program, och du kommer att fortsätta få alla förmåner som du har rätt till. Om du ber oss att radera din information kommer vi dock inte längre kunna erbjuda några av programförmånerna eftersom vi inte längre kan associera dig med förmånerna du tidigare hade rätt till eller kontakta dig gällande dem._

#### COOKIES OCH ANNAN TEKNIK

Vi kan använda cookies och annan teknik för att samla in information om hur du använder vår tjänst och webbplats, för att vi ska kunna förbättra tjänsten och rikta våra annonser.

Vi kan också använda annan teknik såsom artificiell intelligens (”AI”) för andra ändamål, till exempel för att tillhandahålla nya funktioner eller upprätthålla tjänsten och dess funktionalitet.

[**Mer information +**](#Section30)

#### COOKIES OCH LIKNANDE TEKNIK

_En kaka (cookie) är en liten datafil som en webbplats eller liknande skickar till din enhet i registreringssyfte. Information som finns i en cookie kan kopplas till data, såsom din surfaktivitet. Vi kan placera kakor på din enhet och använda dem för att förbättra kvaliteten på vår tjänst, göra tjänsten enklare att använda samt för att kunna rikta annonser. Tredjepartsannonsörer och -tjänsteleverantörer kan också använda, placera och läsa kakor eller använda annan teknik enligt beskrivning nedan på din enhet, och då gäller andra policyer._

_Det finns två typer av kakor: nödvändiga kakor och icke-nödvändiga kakor. Vi använder nödvändiga cookies för att skilja dig från andra användare av Playtika-webbplatsen och för att driva webbplatsen._

_Du kan blockera alla kakor, inklusive nödvändiga kakor, genom att ställa in det i din webbläsare eller använda tredjeparts-pluginprogram som varnar dig om försök att placera kakor på din enhet eller som begränsar kaktyper du ger tillåtelse för._

_På Playtikas webbplatser som använder cookies kan du anpassa dina cookie-inställningar och samtycken via cookie-bannern i samband med ditt första besök på webbplatsen, eller klicka på länken ”Cookieinställningar” i sidfoten eller cookie-widgeten för att ändra dina preferenser när som helst._

_Observera att du kan förlora vissa funktioner i vår tjänst om du inaktiverar kakor. Playtika svarar för närvarande inte på ”Do Not Track”-signaler, oavsett om signalen tas emot på en dator eller en mobil enhet._

_Vi kan också använda liknande teknik, inklusive:_

* _webbfyrar, som gör att vi kan veta om en viss sida besöktes eller om ett e-postmeddelande öppnades_
* _annonsidentifierare såsom Android- och Apple-annonserings-ID (känt som IDFA eller GAID) som är anslutna till din enhet och kan återställas_
* _spårningspixlar, som kan göra det möjligt för oss eller våra annonspartner att annonsera mer effektivt och ändamålsenligt genom att känna igen dina enheter på, av och över olika tjänster och enheter samt identifiera källan till en ny installation_
* _lokalt delade objekt, även känt som flashkakor, som kan hjälpa oss att förhindra bedrägeri, som kommer ihåg dina spelinställningar och ökar inläsningshastigheten._

_Vi kan använda Google Analytics, Facebook Audience Insights och/eller andra liknande tjänster från tredje parter som hämtar in information om ditt beteende och din demografi. Mer information om Google Analytics finns på deras webbplats ([www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)), där du kan avanmäla dig från Googles insamling och behandling av information._

_Vi kan använda flashkakor, som fungerar på ett annat sätt än webbläsarkakor. Besök Adobes webbplats för att läsa mer om flashkakor och gå till panelen Global Privacy settings för att hantera dem._

#### ARTIFICIELL INTELLIGENS

_

Vi kan använda teknik som (a) kan anses utgöra automatiserat beslutsfattande eller profilering och/eller som (b) inkluderar behandling av information som en del av utbildning, testning och användning av artificiell intelligens (teknik som efterliknar intelligent mänskligt beteende) för att utvärdera informationen vi samlar in (inklusive till exempel aktivitet i spel och kommunikation inom vår tjänst) i syfte att förbättra tjänsten. Till exempel för att underlätta kundsupportprocesser, genomföra undersökningar, anpassa vår tjänst efter dina preferenser och för andra legitima affärsändamål.

Om du har frågor om dina rättigheter kontaktar du ditt lokala dataskyddsombud för att be om vägledning. Alternativt kan du kontakta oss. Du hittar vår kontaktinformation i avsnittet Kontakta oss nedan.

Innan vi uppfyller någon begäran från dig kan vi komma att be om information, dokument eller andra bevis för att bekräfta din identitet. Om du inte kan tillhandahålla underlagen vi ber om, kan vi eventuellt inte tillgodose ditt önskemål. Vi agerar på detta sätt för att förhindra bedräglig, illvillig eller på annat sätt skadlig utlämning, radering eller annan aktivitet i relation till din information. I vissa jurisdiktioner kan du skicka in din begäran genom ett auktoriserat ombud som agerar å dina vägnar. Vi kan kräva att ombud verifierar att de agerar å dina vägnar.

I USA kan man skicka in begäran om avanmälan på flera sätt. Se avsnittet Avanmälan från anpassad annonsering ovan för mer information. Dessutom kan du, beroende på din delstat, skicka in en begäran om avanmälan via Global Privacy Control-signalen. GPC-signalen påverkar bara individuella enheter.

#### KİŞİSELLEŞTİRİLMİŞ REKLAMLARI DEVRE DIŞI BIRAKMA

_

İkamet ettiğiniz ve Hizmetlerimizi aldığınız yere bağlı olarak, üçüncü tarafların kişiselleştirilmiş reklamlarını devre dışı bırakma hakkına sahip olabilirsiniz. Bu durumda üçüncü tarafların kişiselleştirilmiş reklamlarını almak istemiyorsanız, bu reklamları istediğiniz zaman uygulamalarımızın ayarlar bölümünden devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz.

Ayrıca cihaz(lar)ınızdaki reklam izleme ayarlarını değiştirmek suretiyle de kişiselleştirilmiş reklamları devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz. Bunun için cihazınızdaki reklam tanımlayıcısını (IDFA gibi) sıfırlayabilir veya Digital Advertising Alliance'tan “AppChoices” gibi, kişiye özel reklam amaçlı bilgilerin toplanmasını ve uygulamalar arasında kullanımını kontrol eden uygulamalar indirebilirsiniz.

AppChoices uygulaması gibi üçüncü taraf devre dışı bırakma araçlarının işletenleri ve sahipleri bağımsızdır. Playtika, bu araçları veya bu araçlar aracılığıyla reklam verenler ve diğerleri tarafından sunulan seçenekleri yönetmez, işletmez veya onaylamaz. Bunlar sadece oyunculara kolaylık sağlamak amacıyla burada listelenmiştir.

Playtika şu anda Hizmetlerimizi yürüten hiçbir platformda “Do Not Track” sinyallerine yanıt vermemektedir.

Kişiselleştirilmiş reklamları devre dışı bıraksanız bile Playtika'nın oyunlarında Playtika'dan ve üçüncü taraflardan reklam almaya devam edebilirsiniz; ancak bu reklamlar size özel olmayacaktır.

Playtika’nın uluslararası bilgi aktarımları hakkında daha fazla bilgiye ihtiyacınız olursa lütfen aşağıdaki Bize Ulaşın bölümünü kullanın.

_

#### ÇOCUKLAR

Çocukları koruma yasalarına uymaya kararlıyız. Bazı oyunlarımızda, çocukların Hizmetlerimize ulaşmalarını önlemek için yaş kapıları kullanıyoruz. Bazı oyunlarımızda (Best Fiends and Best Fiends Stars dahil) çocuklar oynamaya veya hesap oluşturmaya çalıştığında kullanılan, sınırlı oyun ve veri işleme özelliklerine sahip kısıtlı erişim sürümlerimiz bulunmaktadır.

[**Diğer Bilgiler +**](#Section24)

#### OYMAMAK İÇİN KAÇ YAŞINDA OLMALIYIM?

_Playtika'nın [Hizmet Şartları](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) bazı oyunlarımızın belirli yaşın altında kullanıcılar tarafından kullanımını kısıtlamaktadır (oynadığınız oyuna ve ikamet ettiğiniz yerin kanunlarına bağlı olarak). Belirli oyunlarda, Hizmetler üzerinden herhangi bir kişiden bilgi toplanmasını kısıtlayabilir, çocukların Hizmetleri kullanmasına izin veren bir yaş kapısı uygulayabilir, Hizmetler üzerinden çocuklardan bilgi toplanmasını sınırlayabilir veya çocuklardan bilgi toplamak için bir ebeveynin veya vasinin iznini isteyebiliriz._

_Hizmetimiz üzerindeki yaş kural ve kısıtlamaları hakkında daha fazla bilgi için [Hizmet Şartlarımızı](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service/) incelemenizi öneriyoruz._

#### YAŞ KAPISI NEDİR VE NASIL ÇALIŞIR?

_

Yaş kapısı, belirli bir yaşın altındaki kullanıcıların uygulamalara ve web sitelerine erişimini engellemek veya farklı yaş gruplarının uygun bir deneyim yaşamasını sağlamak için uygulanan bir sistemdir.

Yaş kapısı uygulanan bir oyun oynuyorsanız, yaşınız hakkında bilgi vermenizi isteyen bir açılır pencere gösterilir. Bu bilgiler yalnızca oyunu oynamaya uygun yaşta olduğunuzu doğrulamak için kullanılır.

_

#### ÇOCUĞUM BİR Playtika OYUNU OYNUYOR

_Playtika,16 yaş altındaki tüketicilerin kişisel verilerini, bağlamsal davranışsal reklamcılık faaliyetleri kapsamında satmaz ya da paylaşmaz. Analiz ve reklam amacıyla bilgileri anonim hale getirebiliriz, bu durumda bilgileri yeniden tanımlamaya çalışmayacağız._

_**Mali Teşvik Bildirimi.** Ödüller ve özel teklifler gibi belirli avantajlar sağlayan bir ödül programının yanı sıra çekilişler veya yarışmalar şeklinde diğer programlar da sunuyoruz. Bu programların amaçları doğrultusunda, adınız ve iletişim bilgilerinizin yanı sıra Hizmetleri kullanımınızla ilgili bilgileri toplayabiliriz. Bu bilgileri yukarıda açıklandığı şekilde açıklayabilir, satabilir veya paylaşabiliriz. Bu teşvikler veya programlar ABD eyalet gizlilik yasaları çerçevesinde “mali teşvik” veya “iyi niyetli sadakat programı” olarak değerlendirilebilir._

_Yasalar gereği bu tür programlar vasıtasıyla elde ettiğimiz bilgilere bir değer tayin etmemiz gerekirse, toplanan ve kullanılan bilgilere, gelecekteki paylaşacağımız size özel tekliflerin değerine dayanarak bir değer tayin ederiz; bu değer toplanan bilgi kategorilerine ve sunulan veya tanıtılan ürüne göre değişebilir._

_Herhangi bir teşvik programına katılım gönüllülük esasına dayanır ve bir programa kaydolmakla, bilgilerinizin programla bağlantılı olarak toplanmasına, kullanılmasına ve açıklanmasına izin vermiş olursunuz. Daha sonra onayınızı geri çekmek isterseniz, bunu bizimle iletişime geçerek veya varsa ilgili programın hüküm ve koşullarında belirtilen talimatları izleyerek yapabilirsiniz._

_Bilgilerinizin satış veya paylaşımından ya da bilgilerinizin hedeflemeli reklamcılık amaçlı kullanımından vazgeçmek isterseniz, programlarımıza katılımınız etkilenmeyecek ve sahip olduğunuz tüm avantajlardan faydalanmaya devam edeceksiniz. Bununla birlikte, tüm bilgilerinizi silmek için talepte bulunursanız, sahip olduğunuz avantajları sağlamaya devam edemeyiz, çünkü daha önceden sahip olduğunuz avantajlarla sizi ilişkilendirmek ya da bunlara ilişkin olarak sizinle iletişim kurmamız mümkün olmaz._

#### ÇEREZLER VE DİĞER TEKNOLOJİLER

Hizmetimizi geliştirmek ve reklamlarımızın hedefini belirlemede bize yardımcı olması amacıyla, Hizmetimizi ve web sitemizi nasıl kullandığınıza dair bilgi toplamak için çerezler ve diğer teknolojiler kullanabiliriz.

Ayrıca, yeni özellikler sağlamak veya Hizmet fonksiyonelliğimize yardımcı olmak gibi başka amaçlarla Yapay Zeka (“AI”) dahil olmak üzere teknolojiden faydalanabiliriz.

[**Diğer Bilgiler +**](#Section30)

#### ÇEREZLER VE BENZER TEKNOLOJİ

_Çerez, kayıt tutma amacıyla cihazınıza aktarılan küçük bir veri dosyasıdır. Çerez içinde yer alan bilgiler, tarama etkinliğiniz gibi bilgilerle bağlantılı olabilir. Cihazınıza çerezler yerleştirebilir ve bunları Hizmetimizin kalitesini artırmak, kullanımını kolaylaştırmak ve hedefli reklamlar sunmak gibi amaçlarla kullanabiliriz. Üçüncü taraf reklam verenler ve hizmet sağlayıcılar, kendi politikaları çerçevesinde cihazınızda aşağıda açıklanan çerezleri veya diğer teknolojileri kullanabilir, yerleştirebilir veya okuyabilirler._

_İki tip çerez vardır: Temel Çerezler ve Temel Olmayan Çerezler. Temel Çerezleri sizi Playtika web sitemizin diğer kullanıcılarından ayırt etmek ve web sitemizi düzgün bir şekilde işletmek için kullanırız._

_Cihazınıza çerez yerleştirme girişimleri hakkında sizi uyarmak veya cihazınıza yerleştirilmesine izin verdiğiniz çerez türlerini sınırlamak için web tarayıcılarınızı ayarlayarak veya üçüncü taraf eklentileri kullanarak temel çerezler de dahil olmak üzere tüm çerezleri engelleyebilirsiniz._

_Çerez kullanan Playtika web sitelerinde, çerez ayarlarınızı ve onaylarınızı web sitesini ilk ziyaretinizde çerez başlığı aracılığıyla özelleştirebilir veya tercihlerinizi istediğiniz zaman değiştirmek için web sayfası altındaki “Çerez Ayarları” bağlantısını veya çerez eklentisine tıklayabilirsiniz._

_Çerezleri devre dışı bırakırsanız, Hizmetimizin bazı özelliklerini ve işlevlerini kaybedebileceğinizi lütfen not edin. Playtika ister bir bilgisayardan, ister bir mobil cihazdan sinyal alınsın veya alınmasın henüz Do Not Track sinyallerine yanıt vermemektedir._

_Aşağıdakiler gibi diğer benzer teknolojileri de kullanabiliriz:_

* _belirli bir sayfanın ziyaret edilip edilmediğini veya bir e-postanın açılıp açılmadığını bilmemizi sağlayan web işaretçileri;_
* _IDFA veya GAID olarak bilinen, cihazınıza bağlı olan ve cihazınızda sıfırlanabilen Android ve Apple reklam kimliği gibi reklam tanımlayıcıları;_
* _cihaz(lar)ınızı açık, kapalı ve farklı servisler ve cihazlar arasında tanıyarak ve yeni bir yüklemenin kaynağını belirleyerek bizim veya reklam ortaklarımızın daha verimli ve etkili bir şekilde reklam vermesine olanak tanıyan izleme pikselleri; ve_
* _dolandırıcılığı azaltmamıza, oyun içi ayarlarınızı anımsamamıza ve yükleme sürelerini hızlandırmamıza yardımcı olabilecek flash çerezler olarak da bilinen yerel paylaşılan nesneler._

_Davranışlarınız ve demografik verileriniz hakkında bilgi toplayan üçüncü tarafların Google Analytics, Facebook Audience Insights ve/veya diğer benzer hizmetlerini kullanabiliriz. Google Analytics hakkında daha fazla bilgi için ([www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)) web sitesini ziyaret edin. Burada Google tarafından bilgi toplama ve işlemeyi devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz._

_Tarayıcı çerezlerinden farklı şekilde çalışan Flash çerezleri kullanabiliriz. Flash çerezleri hakkında daha fazla bilgi almak ve yönetmek için Adobe web sitesini ziyaret edebilir ve Global Gizlilik Ayarları Paneli'nde değişiklik yapabilirsiniz._

#### YAPAY ZEKA

_

Bu konuda, (a) otomatik karar verme veya profil oluşturma olarak düşünülebilecek ve/veya (b) Hizmetimizi iyileştirmek için topladığımız bilgileri (örneğin, oyun içi etkinlik ve Hizmetimizdeki iletişimler dahil) değerlendirmek üzere Yapay Zekanın (akıllı insan davranışını taklit eden teknoloji) eğitimi, testi ve kullanımının bir parçası olarak bilgilerin işlenmesini içeren teknolojiler kullanabiliriz. Örneğin, müşteri destek süreçlerini kolaylaştırmak, anketler düzenlemek, Hizmetimizi tercihlerinize göre uyarlamak ve diğer yasal ticari amaçlar için.
