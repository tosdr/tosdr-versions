If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.

3. How We Share Personal Data

We may share personal data about you between and among Playtika Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries.

Additionally, we may disclose or publish aggregated and analytical information (information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify any individual player, for example, players between the ages of 25 and 30 who live in Chicago) and other non-personal data about our players for industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, advertising, and other business purposes.

In addition, we may share information (which may include personal data) with third parties (in other words, parties other than Playtika) or allow third parties to collect this information from our Service as described in this Privacy Notice.

A.    Service Providers

Playtika uses its subsidiaries and other unaffiliated companies (“Service Providers”) to support the Service, for example, to assist us with processing payments, analyzing data, optimizing game play and enhancing player experience, e-mail delivery, hosting services, and managing and delivering contextual and tailored advertisements.

B.     Friends and Other Playtika Players

In most Playtika games, if you play or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends may see your name, profile photo, and details about your gameplay (like your game progression or rewards earned).

If you use our Service in response to an invitation from another player, that player may see certain information about you and your in-game activities, including when you join and the level(s) you reach within the game. Correspondingly, in many Playtika games, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not, may be able to see details about your gameplay (including the identification of any Playtika games you have played), communicate with you within our Service, and view your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through a social network and/or Playtika’s communication channels.

C.      Advertising, Including Third-Party and Tailored Advertising

We may have advertising on our Service. When advertisers or ad networks place ads in our Service, they may collect, or we may share the following types of information from within our Service:

•   performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);

•   aggregated and/or de-identified information about players that is not intended to specifically identify any individual player (For example, players between the ages of 45 and 65 who live in San Francisco);

•   certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and device identifiers);

•   your social network ID;

•   your in-game activity (for example, your level).

The information collected may be used to:

•   measure how effective ads are;

•   personalize the player experience by showing advertisements for products and services that may be more likely to appeal to you;

•   undertake web analytics (like Google Analytics) to analyze traffic and other player activity.

Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons, and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.

Please note, after clicking on a third-party advertisement, you may no longer be on a site hosted by Playtika, in an application owned by Playtika, or on the social network through which you are playing Playtika’s games.

D.     Sale or Merger

In the event that Playtika undertakes efforts to engage in a business transition (including but not limited to a merger with and/or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part its assets), we may disclose relevant information we have, including personal data, to the successor organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts as described in this Privacy Notice to let you know of the business transition before transferring personal data to the extent required by law.  
  
E.     Legal Compliance

 We may share personal data in the following circumstances:

•   when we have a good faith belief that we have to disclose the information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena);

•   to satisfy any laws or regulations;

•   where we believe in our sole discretion that the Service is being used in committing a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, and other security precautions;

•   when we believe in our sole discretion that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of any person or the public generally;

•   to protect the rights or property of Playtika and other applicable third parties, including to enforce our [Terms of Service](https://playtika.com/terms-service).

4.  Your Rights

Depending upon the applicable law where you live, you may have the right to make requests with respect to personal data that Playtika processes about you, for example to request:

•   information;

•   access;

•   correction (or rectification) of personal data that you think is incorrect;

•   erasure (or deletion);

•   an electronic copy (or portability).

You may also have the right object to certain processing, including to opt out of targeted advertising. 

Playtika allows all players to submit requests via the [Playtika Privacy Portal](https://playtika.service-now.com/privacy_security.do) or through the Support page accessible from within the game.

A.     Manage Information We Get from Platforms

To manage the information Playtika receives about you from a third-party platform where you play our games, like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc. you will need to follow the instructions for the relevant third-party application(s) for updating your information and changing your privacy settings.

C.     Opting Out of Promotional Communications

If you want to stop receiving Promotional Communications from Playtika, you can click on the "unsubscribe" link in any promotional email from Playtika. If you want to stop receiving texts or SMS messages from us, you can also use the “unsubscribe” link or reply “STOP” to any promotional message. Please note that it may take us some time for your opt-out to become effective.

D.     Opting Out of Facebook messages

If you want to stop receiving messages through our game pages on Facebook, you can turn off all messages through your Facebook “settings”.

E.     Opting Out of Push Notifications

When you install our apps on your mobile device, you can choose to receive push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your device even when the app is not on. You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “Settings”.

Additionally, in some of our game apps, you may find an option under “Settings” to turn off push notifications.

F.     Opting Out of Third-Party Tailored Advertising

In games that serve third-party tailored ads, we provide a toggle button to disable them.

For more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and mobile web advertising you can visit [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). To opt out, for businesses that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, you can exercise that option at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

If you live in the EU, you can get information and exercise your choices at [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

These opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Playtika. Playtika does not control, operate, or endorse these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. They are listed here only as a convenience for players.

In addition, if you do not want to receive third-party tailored ads, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. You can also reset the advertising identifier (like an IDFA) from your device’s Settings, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous advertising identifier. Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising. Like the opt-out tools mentioned above for web, these mobile opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Playtika. Playtika does not control, operate or endorse these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.

**_Please note that you may still receive advertisements from Playtika and third parties within Playtika’s games even if you opt out of tailored advertising; these ads will not be tailored to you._**

G.     Opting Out of Cookie Tracking

You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your device or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit the [Adobe website](http://www.adobe.com/) and make changes at the [Global Privacy Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html).

If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of our Service because Playtika cookies are necessary for providing the Service.

On Playtika websites that use cookies, you can also use the cookie banner or click on the “Cookies Settings” link, to choose your preferences.   

H.     Do Not Track

Note that Playtika does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.

 5.  Children’s Privacy

In accordance with the Terms of Service, you may not use the Service if you are under 18 years old. In addition, if you are under 21 years old, you may not create an account, access, use, or download the following games: Slotomania, House of Fun, Caesars Casino, Vegas Downtown Slots, World Series of Poker, Poker Heat, and Bingo Blitz.

Playtika is committed to complying with laws protecting children. If you believe that your child has submitted personal data to Playtika, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.playtika.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  Playtika will take reasonable steps to delete such information as soon as possible.

  

6. International Transfers, Retention, Security, Links, Updates, and How to Contact Us

 A.    International Transfers 

Playtika may send, access, use, and/or store personal data outside of the country or region where you live including, for example, to the United States and Israel. We may transfer personal data to our subsidiaries, vendors, business partners, and others as described in this Privacy Notice.

Laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where personal data is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws in place where you live. When we transfer personal data outside of the location where it was collected, we put into place appropriate safeguards (including, for example, contracts) or otherwise make efforts to ensure that such transfers meet applicable local legal requirements.

By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of personal data outside of the country or region where you live. If you do not consent to such transfer, please do not use our Service.

B.     Retention   

We may retain personal data for as long as you use the Service and as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as necessary to comply with our business requirements and applicable laws; to comply with any legal, accounting or reporting obligations; to resolve disputes; to protect our assets; to efficiently run our business; and to enforce our agreements.

C.     Security

We take reasonable steps designed to protect personal data; however, no system or network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure.

D.    Links to Other Sites/Apps

The Service may include links to other websites and/or applications that are owned and/or operated by others. Any information you provide on such websites and/or apps are subject to the privacy policy on such website or app, and Playtika is not responsible for the content, privacy policy, terms of use, or security practices of such site and/or app. You should review the terms and privacy policy of any site or app that you access.

E.     Updates

Playtika reserves the right to amend the Privacy Notice from time to time, and Playtika encourages you to consult the Privacy Notice regularly for changes.

If we make material changes to our Privacy Notice, we will tell you by placing a notice on Playtika.com or its equivalent in-game, or, if and as required by law, by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you, prior to the change becoming effective. We may supplement this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or forums and on other Playtika websites. You should periodically check [www.Playtika.com](http://www.playtika.com/) and this privacy page for updates.

F.  How to Contact Us

Рекламодатели и рекламные сети могут собирать эту информацию с помощью технологий отслеживания, например, файлов cookie в браузерах и веб-маяков. При этом они могут использовать одну технологию отслеживания или несколько технологий отслеживания одновременно.

Обратите внимание, что после нажатия на рекламу третьего лица вы можете больше не находиться на сайте Playtika или в приложении, принадлежащем компании Playtika, или в социальной сети, через которую вы играете в игры Playtika.

Per abilitare alcune delle funzionalità social potremmo chiederti di importare i tuoi contatti o di inserirli manualmente in modo da poterli individuare con il nostro Servizio e invitarli a unirsi a te nei nostri giochi o in altri aspetti del nostro Servizio. Sei responsabile di ottenere l'autorizzazione da parte dei tuoi contatti prima di poterci fornire i loro dettagli di contatto.

* condurre ricerche, anche utilizzando i dati personali per creare dati anonimi e/o aggregati. I dati anonimi e aggregati non sono dati personali e possiamo utilizzare e condividere tali dati per qualsiasi scopo legalmente consentito.

Le tue interazioni con il nostro Servizio possono essere monitorate su piattaforme e/o dispositivi.

Oltre a quanto descritto sopra, se hai fornito il tuo indirizzo email a Playtika, potremmo usarlo per comunicare con te in diversi modi, incluso per rispondere alle richieste di assistenza clienti; mantenere te e gli altri informati sulla esperienza di gioco, sui commenti degli amici, sullo stato e sulle promozioni del gioco; e parlarti di regali e richieste dei vicini. Alcuni messaggi, come gli inviti che invii agli amici per unirsi a te in un gioco, possono includere il tuo nome e la foto del profilo. Possiamo anche inviare messaggi promozionali ("Comunicazioni promozionali") direttamente o in collaborazione con altre parti.  Per ulteriori informazioni su come disattivare le Comunicazioni Promozionali, consulta la sezione I tuoi diritti più avanti.

Possiamo utilizzare tecnologie che (a) possono essere considerate un processo decisionale automatizzato o di profilazione, e/o (b) includono l'intelligenza artificiale per valutare i dati personali che raccogliamo (tra cui, ad esempio, l'attività di gioco e le comunicazioni all'interno del nostro Servizio) per migliorare il nostro Servizio (ad esempio, per dare priorità alle richieste di assistenza clienti per ridurre i tempi di risposta, personalizzare l'esperienza di gioco e comprendere le tendenze di risposta a determinate funzionalità del nostro Servizio) e per altri scopi commerciali legittimi. Non utilizzeremo queste tecnologie in un modo che abbia un impatto legalmente significativo sull'utente, a meno che non abbiamo il consenso dell'utente o siamo altrimenti autorizzati legalmente a farlo.

Possiamo utilizzare i dati personali per altri scopi che ti comunichiamo al momento della raccolta, o dietro tuo consenso.

**3. Come condividiamo i dati personali**

Potremmo condividere i tuoi dati personali tra e tra Playtika Holding Corp. e le sue sussidiarie.

Inoltre, possiamo divulgare o pubblicare informazioni aggregate e analitiche (informazioni su di te e altri giocatori collettivamente che non intendono identificare alcun giocatore in particolare, ad esempio, giocatori di età compresa tra 25 e 30 anni che vivono a Chicago) e altri dati non personali sui nostri giocatori per analisi di settore, profilazione demografica, marketing, analisi, pubblicità e altri scopi commerciali.

Ancora, possiamo condividere informazioni (che possono includere dati personali) con terze parti (in altre parole, parti diverse da Playtika) o consentire a terze parti di raccogliere queste informazioni dal nostro Servizio come descritto nella presente Informativa sulla privacy.

**A.     Fornitori di servizi**

Playtika utilizza le sue sussidiarie e altre società non affiliate ("Fornitori di servizi") per supportare il Servizio, ad esempio, l'elaborazione dei pagamenti, l'analisi dei dati, l'ottimizzazione del gioco e il miglioramento dell'esperienza del giocatore, la consegna della posta elettronica, i servizi di hosting, la gestione e la distribuzione di annunci pubblicitari contestuali e personalizzati. 

**B.     Amici e altri giocatori di Playtika**

Nella maggior parte dei giochi Playtika, se giochi o ti registri tramite un social network (ad esempio Facebook Connect), i tuoi amici del social network potrebbero vedere il tuo nome, la foto del profilo e i dettagli della tua esperienza di gioco (come la tua progressione o le ricompense ottenute). Se utilizzi il nostro Servizio in risposta a un invito di un altro giocatore, quel giocatore potrebbe vedere alcune informazioni su di te e sulle tue attività di gioco, incluso quando ti iscrivi e i livelli che raggiungi nel gioco. Di conseguenza, in molti giochi Playtika, altri giocatori, indipendentemente dal fatto che siano amici del social network o meno, possono vedere i dettagli della tua esperienza di gioco (inclusa l'identificazione di tutti i giochi Playtika a cui hai giocato), comunicare con te all'interno del nostro Servizio e visualizzare il tuo profilo di gioco, che può includere il tuo nome o un "nickname" e la tua foto del profilo. Altri giocatori potrebbero anche essere in grado di inviarti richieste di gioco o persino richieste di amicizia attraverso un social network o Playtika.

**C.     Pubblicità, compresa la pubblicità di terzi e la pubblicità mirata**

Il nostro Servizio può includere pubblicità.

Quando inserzionisti o reti pubblicitarie inseriscono annunci nel nostro Servizio, possono raccogliere o ricevere da noi i seguenti tipi di dati all'interno del nostro Servizio:

* dati sul rendimento (come il numero di clic su un annuncio);
* informazioni aggregate e/o non riconducibili ai giocatori che non intendono identificarti alcun giocatore in particolare (come per esempio i giocatori di età compresa tra 45 e 65 anni che vivono a San Francisco);
* determinate informazioni tecniche (ad esempio indirizzi IP, identificatori di dispositivo non persistenti come IDFA e identificatori di dispositivi);
* il tuo ID di social network;
* la tua attività di gioco.

 I dati raccolti possono essere utilizzati per:

* misurare l'efficacia degli annunci;
* personalizzare l’esperienza dei giocatori mostrando pubblicità per prodotti e servizi che è più probabile ti interessi;
* intraprendere analisi web (come Google Analytics) per analizzare il traffico e altre attività dei giocatori.

Gli inserzionisti o le reti pubblicitarie possono raccogliere queste informazioni mediante l'uso di tecnologie di tracciamento come i cookie del browser e i web beacon, utilizzando contemporaneamente una o più tecnologie di tracciamento.

Tieni presente che, dopo aver fatto clic su un annuncio di terze parti, potresti non essere più su un sito ospitato da Playtika, in un’app di proprietà di Playtika o nel social network attraverso il quale stai giocando ai giochi di Playtika.

**D.     Vendita o fusione**

Nel caso in cui Playtika si impegni a intraprendere una transizione aziendale (inclusa, ma non solo, una fusione con e/o acquisizione da parte di un'altra società o la vendita di tutti o parte dei suoi beni, potremmo divulgare le informazioni pertinenti in nostro possesso, comprese quelle personali dati, all'organizzazione successore nella transizione. Faremo ogni ragionevole sforzo come descritto nella presente Informativa sulla privacy per informarti della transizione aziendale prima di trasferire i dati personali nella misura richiesta dalla legge.  
  
 **E.     Conformità legale**

 Possiamo condividere i dati personali nelle seguenti circostanze: 

* quando riteniamo in buona fede di dover divulgare le informazioni in risposta a richieste legittime da parte delle autorità pubbliche, tra cui adempiere ai requisiti di sicurezza nazionale o di applicazione della legge, o a procedimenti legali (ad esempio un ordine del tribunale, un mandato di perquisizione o una citazione);
* per rispettare leggi o regolamenti;
* laddove riteniamo a nostra esclusiva discrezione che il Servizio venga utilizzato per commettere un reato, tra cui denunciare tale attività criminale o condividere informazioni con altre società e organizzazioni a fini di protezione dalle frodi, riduzione del rischio di credito e altre precauzioni di sicurezza;
* quando crediamo, a nostra esclusiva discrezione, che vi sia un'emergenza che costituisce una minaccia per la salute e/o la sicurezza di qualsiasi persona o del pubblico in generale;
* per proteggere i diritti o la proprietà di Playtika e di altre terze parti applicabili, incluso far rispettare i nostri [Termini del servizio](https://www.playtika.com/terms-service).

**4\.  I tuoi diritti**

A seconda della legge applicabile in cui vivi, potresti avere il diritto di effettuare richieste in relazione ai dati personali che Playtika elabora su di te, ad esempio per richiedere:

* informazioni; 
* l'accesso;
* la correzione (o rettifica) dei dati personali che ritieni non corretti;
* la cancellazione (o cancellazione);
* una copia elettronica (o portabilità);

Hai anche il diritto di opporti a determinati trattamenti, inclusa la rinuncia alla pubblicità mirata.

Playtika consente a tutti i suoi giocatori di inoltrare richieste dal [Portale sulla privacy di Playtika](https://playtika.service-now.com/privacy_security.do) o dalla pagina di supporto a cui puoi accedere dal gioco.

**A.     Gestione dei dati ottenuti da piattaforme**

Per gestire le informazioni che Playtika riceve su di te da una piattaforma di terze parti in cui giochi ai nostri giochi, come Facebook, Apple, Amazon ecc., Dovrai seguire le istruzioni delle rispettive applicazioni di terze parti per aggiornare le tue informazioni e cambiare le tue impostazioni sulla privacy.

**C.     Annullare la ricezione di comunicazioni promozionali**

Se desideri interrompere la ricezione di Comunicazioni Promozionali da Playtika, puoi fare clic sul link "annulla iscrizione" in qualsiasi email promozionale ricevuta da Playtika. Se non vuoi più ricevere SMS o SMS da te, puoi rispondere "STOP" a qualsiasi messaggio promozionale. Tieni presente che potrebbe essere necessario del tempo prima che la tua rinuncia diventi effettiva. 

**D.     Disattivare i messaggi di Facebook**

Se desideri interrompere la ricezione di messaggi tramite le nostre pagine di gioco su Facebook, puoi disattivare tutti i messaggi attraverso le “impostazioni” di Facebook.

**E.     Disattivare le notifiche push**

Quando installi le nostre app sul tuo dispositivo mobile, puoi scegliere di ricevere notifiche push, ovvero i messaggi che un'app ti invia sul tuo dispositivo anche quando l'app non è aperta. Puoi disattivare le notifiche dalle "Impostazioni" del tuo dispositivo mobile.

Inoltre, in alcune delle nostre app di gioco, è possibile trovare un'opzione alla voce "Impostazioni" per disattivare le notifiche push.

**F.     Disabilitare la pubblicità mirata di terze parti**

Nei giochi che offrono annunci di terze parti mirati forniamo un pulsante di attivazione/disattivazione per disabilitarli.

Per ulteriori informazioni sulla pubblicità personalizzata e sulle tue scelte per impedire a terzi di fornire pubblicità web e mobile web mirata, puoi visitare [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Per rinunciare, per le aziende che partecipano alla Digital Advertising Alliance, puoi esercitare tale opzione su [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) e [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). 

Se vivi nell'UE, puoi ottenere informazioni ed esercitare le tue scelte su [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). 

Gli strumenti di disattivazione sono forniti da terze parti e non da Playtika. Playtika non controlla, gestisce o approva questi strumenti o le scelte che gli inserzionisti e altri forniscono tramite questi strumenti. Sono elencati qui solo per comodità dei giocatori.

Inoltre, se non desideri ricevere annunci pubblicitari mirati di terze parti, puoi disattivarli modificando le impostazioni di tracciamento degli annunci sul tuo dispositivo. Puoi anche ripristinare l'identificatore della pubblicità (come un IDFA) dalle Impostazioni del tuo dispositivo, che impedirà l'uso continuato dei dati comportamentali esistenti, legati al precedente identificatore della pubblicità. Inoltre, a seconda del fornitore della piattaforma (come Apple o Google), potresti essere in grado di scaricare app, come l'app "AppChoices" di Digital Advertising Alliance, che ti offrono il controllo sulla raccolta e l'uso di dati cross-app per pubblicità mirata. Come gli strumenti di disattivazione per il web di cui sopra, questi strumenti di disattivazione per dispositivi mobili sono forniti da terze parti, non da Playtika. Playtika non controlla, utilizza o approva questi strumenti o le scelte che gli inserzionisti e altri forniscono tramite questi strumenti.

**_Tieni presente che, anche se disattivi la pubblicità mirata, potresti comunque ricevere annunci pubblicitari da Playtika e terze parti all'interno dei giochi di Playtika; non saranno annunci mirati._**

**G.     Disabilitare la tracciatura dei cookie**

Puoi impostare il tuo browser in modo che ti avvisi sui tentativi di installare cookie sul tuo dispositivo o per limitare il tipo di cookie consentiti. I flash cookie funzionano in modo diverso rispetto ai cookie del browser, pertanto gli strumenti di gestione dei cookie disponibili nel browser potrebbero non rimuovere i flash cookie. Per saperne di più sulla gestione dei flash cookie, visita il [Sito web di Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/) ed effettua modifiche nel [Pannello globale delle impostazioni sulla privacy](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html).

Se disabiliti i cookie, potresti perdere alcune delle caratteristiche e delle funzionalità del nostro Servizio perché i cookie di Playtika sono necessari per fornirti il Servizio.

Sui siti web di Playtika che utilizzano i cookie, puoi anche utilizzare il banner dei cookie o cliccare sul link "Impostazioni dei cookie", per scegliere le tue preferenze.

**H.     Segnali "Do Not Track"**

Playtika può inviare, accedere, utilizzare e/o memorizzare i dati personali al di fuori del paese o della regione in cui vivi, inclusi, ad esempio, gli Stati Uniti e Israele. Possiamo trasferire i dati personali alle nostre sussidiarie, fornitori, partner commerciali e altri come descritto nella presente Informativa sulla privacy.

Le leggi variano da giurisdizione a giurisdizione, quindi le leggi sulla privacy applicabili ai luoghi in cui i dati personali vengono trasferiti o archiviati, utilizzati o elaborati, possono essere diverse dalle leggi sulla privacy in vigore nel luogo in cui risiedi. Quando trasferiamo i dati personali al di fuori del luogo in cui sono stati raccolti, mettiamo in atto misure di salvaguardia adeguate (inclusi, ad esempio, contratti) o ci adoperiamo per garantire in altro modo che tali trasferimenti soddisfino i requisiti legali locali applicabili.

**C.     Sicurezza**

Adottiamo misure ragionevoli volte a proteggere i dati personali; tuttavia, nessun sistema o rete è sicuro al 100% e quindi non possiamo garantire la sicurezza dei dati. Nella misura massima consentita dalla legge, non accettiamo responsabilità per divulgazione non autorizzata.

**D.    Collegamenti ad altri siti o app**

Il Servizio può includere collegamenti ad altri siti web e/o applicazioni proprietarie e/o gestiti da terzi.

**E.     Aggiornamenti**

Playtika si riserva il diritto di modificare periodicamente l'Informativa sulla privacy e Playtika ti incoraggia a consultare regolarmente l'Informativa sulla privacy per eventuali modifiche.

Se apportiamo modifiche sostanziali alla nostra Informativa sulla privacy, te lo comunicheremo inserendo un avviso su Playtika.com o su un suo equivalente nel gioco, oppure, se e come richiesto dalla legge, inviandoti un avviso all'indirizzo email che abbiamo in archivio prima che la modifica diventi effettiva. Possiamo integrare questo processo inserendo avvisi sui blog di giochi, sulle pagine dei social network e/o sui forum e su altri siti Playtika. Ti invitiamo a controllare regolarmente [www.Playtika.com](http://www.playtika.com/) e questa pagina per aggiornamenti sulla privacy.

Playtika pozwalawszystkim graczom na przesyłanie wniosków za pośrednictwem [Portalu ochrony prywatności Playtika](https://playtika.service-now.com/privacy_security.do)  lub poprzez zakładkę wsparcia, dostępną w grze .

A.     Zarządzanie danymi, które otrzymujemy od platform

Aby zarządzać Twoimi danymi, które Playtika otrzymuje platformy innej firmy, na której grasz w nasze gry, takie jak Facebook, Apple, Amazon itp., musisz postępować zgodnie z instrukcjami  danej aplikacji (lub każdych danych aplikacji) innej firmy, aby zaktualizować dane lub zmienić swoje ustawienia prywatności. 

C.     Rezygnacja z otrzymywania promocyjnych wiadomości

Jeśli nie chcesz więcej otrzymywać powiadomień o promocjach od Playtika, możesz kliknąć link „Zrezygnuj z subskrypcji” w dowolnym e-mailu promocyjnym od Playtika. Jeśli nie chcesz już otrzymywać SMS-ów, możesz kliknąć w link „unsubscribe” lub odpowiedzieć „STOP” na dowolną wiadomość promocyjną. Pamiętaj, że może minąć trochę czasu, zanim Twoja rezygnacja stanie się skuteczna. 

D.    Rezygnacja z otrzymywania wiadomości na Facebooku

Dodatkowo w przypadku niektórych naszych aplikacji gier możesz znaleźć w ustawieniach opcję wyłączenia powiadomień push.

F.     Rezygnacja z reklam firm zewnętrznych dostosowanych do użytkownika

W grach, które wyświetlają dostosowane do użytkownika reklamy firm zewnętrznych mamy przycisk  wyłączający je.

Jeśli chcesz uzyskać więcej informacji na temat reklamy dostosowanej do użytkownika i swoich opcji, aby uniemożliwić stronom trzecim dostarczanie dostosowanej reklamy internetowej i mobilnej, możesz odwiedzić następujące strony: [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Aby zrezygnować, w przypadku firm, które należą do Digital Advertising Alliance, możesz skorzystać z tej opcji pod adresem [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) lub [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). 

Jeśli mieszkasz w UE, możesz uzyskać informacje i dokonać wyboru pod adresem [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). 

Te narzędzia rezygnacji są dostarczane przez firmy zewnętrzne, a nie Playtika. Playtika nie kontroluje, nie obsługuje ani nie rekomenduje tych narzędzi ani wyborów dokonywanych przez reklamodawców i inne osoby za ich pomocą. Są one wymienione tutaj tylko dla wygody graczy.

Ponadto, jeśli nie chcesz otrzymywać dostosowanych reklam firm zewnętrznych, możesz zrezygnować, dostosowując ustawienia śledzenia reklam na swoim urządzeniu. Możesz także zresetować identyfikator reklamowy (np. IDFA) w  ustawieniach swojego urządzenia, co uniemożliwi dalsze korzystanie z istniejących danych behawioralnych powiązanych z poprzednim identyfikatorem reklamowym. Ponadto, w zależności od dostawcy platformy (np. Apple lub Google), możesz pobierać aplikacje, takie jak „AppChoices” Digital Advertising Alliance, które oferują kontrolę nad gromadzeniem i wykorzystywaniem danych między aplikacjami na potrzeby dostosowanych reklam. Podobnie jak wspomniane powyżej narzędzia rezygnacji z reklam online, te mobilne narzędzia rezygnacji są dostarczane przez firmy zewnętrzne, a nie Playtika. Playtika nie kontroluje, nie obsługuje ani nie rekomenduje tych narzędzi ani wyborów dokonywanych przez reklamodawców i inne osoby za ich pomocą.

_**Pamiętaj, że w grach Playtika nadal będziesz otrzymywać reklamy od Playtika i stron trzecich; te reklamy nie będą do Ciebie dostosowane.**_

G.     Rezygnacja ze śledzenia plików cookie

Możesz ustawić swoją przeglądarkę internetową, aby ostrzegała Cię przed próbami umieszczenia plików cookie na Twoim urządzeniu lub ograniczała dozwolone rodzaje plików cookie. Pliki cookie flash działają inaczej niż pliki cookie w przeglądarce, a narzędzia do zarządzania plikami cookie dostępne w przeglądarce internetowej mogą nie usuwać plików cookie flash.

為了管理 Playtika 從您所玩遊戲的協力廠商平台（如 Facebook、蘋果、亞馬遜等）接收到的關於您的資訊，您需要遵從相關協力廠商應用程式關於更新資訊和修改隱私設定的指示。

E.     選擇退出協力廠商的定制廣告

在某些投放協力廠商定制廣告的遊戲中，我們為您提供了一個切換按鈕，可讓您停用協力廠商定制廣告。

有關定制廣告和選擇防止協力廠商投放定制網頁和行動網路廣告的更多內容，您可以前往[www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)：如要選擇退出，對於參加數位廣告聯盟的企業，您可以在[www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices)和選擇退出[www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices)。

這些選擇退出工具是由協力廠商而非 Playtika 提供。Playtika 對這些工具不具有控制權及營運權，亦不進行背書，對於廣告商和其它方透過這些工具提供的內容也沒有選擇。這些工具僅出於提供玩家方便為目的名列於此。

此外，如果您不想接收協力廠商在應用程式內定制的廣告，則可以透過調整裝置上的廣告追蹤設定來選擇退出。您還可以從裝置的設定頁面重置廣告識別碼（如 IDFA），這將會防止繼續使用與過去廣告識別碼掛鉤的現有的行為資料。並且，取決於平台供應商（如蘋果或谷歌），您可下載如數位廣告聯盟的「AppChoices」等應用程式，為收集和使用定制廣告的跨應用資料提供控制。同上文提及的選擇退出工具一樣，這些行動退出工具由協力廠商而不是 Playtika 提供。Playtika 對這些工具不具有控制權及營運權，亦不進行背書，對於廣告商和其它方透過這些工具提供的內容也沒有選擇。

_**請注意，即使您選擇退出定制廣告，您仍然可能在**_ _**Playtika**_ _**接收來自**_**_Playtika_****_和_**_**協力廠商的廣告，這些廣告不會**__**为您定制**__**。**_

**E. Uyarlanmış Üçüncü Taraf Reklamları Devre Dışı Bırakma**
