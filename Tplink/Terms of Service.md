[Terms Of Use](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/about-us/kasa-terms-of-use/) [Privacy Policy](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/about-us/kasa-privacy/) [Kasa Care Service Agreement](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/about-us/kasacare-service-agreement/) [Your California Privacy Rights](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/about-us/kasa-california-privacy-rights/)

Kasa Care Service Agreement
===========================

[Overview and Relation to Other Agreements](#overview-and-relation-to-other-agreements)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your use of the Kasa Care services (the "Kasa Care Services") is governed by this Kasa Care Service Agreement (the "Service Agreement") and the [Terms Of Use](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/about-us/kasa-terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/about-us/kasa-privacy/). All additional guidelines, terms, or rules in the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy are incorporated by reference into this Service Agreement and you are agreeing to accept and abide by them by using the Kasa Care Services. If there are any conflicts among this Service Agreement and the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, this Service Agreement will govern to the extent of the conflicts.

[Service Summary](#service-summary)
-----------------------------------

When you purchase a Kasa Camera product, you have the option of using our Kasa Care Services. With the Kasa Care Services, any video footage captured by your Kasa Cam is automatically sent to our servers for storage. From your iOS or Android device(s) you can then access recordings covering limited time frames depending on your level of Kasa Care Services.

[Subscription Plans](#subscription-plans)
-----------------------------------------

Every Kasa Cam comes with our free Kasa Care Services package ("Free Package") that may provide you with various services. We reserve the right to modify any services provided under the Free Package or terminate the Free Package at any time in our sole discretion.

We also offer multiple tiers of paid subscription plans for our Kasa Care Services. For plan details and plan pricing, please visit [www.tp-link.com/us/kasacare](https://www.tp-link.com/us/kasacare/). Subscription fees are charged on the first day of the applicable subscription period. If your credit card transaction is declined or your credit card expires, we reserve the right to cancel your Kasa Care Services subscription, but your subscription will not automatically be terminated. You will remain responsible for all unpaid amounts that accrue as a result of your declined or expired credit card. Additionally, you will be responsible for all costs we incur in connection with the collection of such unpaid amounts, including court costs, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees and any other associated costs. If you use Credit Card as a payment method, you may be charged a foreign exchange fee by your credit card company when the charge currency differs from your credit card currency. TP-Link is not responsible for these additional charges.

### [(a) Subscription Renewal](#a-subscription-renewal)

All Kasa Care Services subscription plans renew automatically. When we renew your subscription plan, we will use the payment method then currently associated with your account. You will not be notified in advance of impending renewals unless you choose an annual subscription plan, in which case we will send an annual renewal reminder to the email associated with your account. Following the processing of your applicable subscription payment, we will send you a receipt to the email associated with your account. When you purchase any of our Kasa Care Services subscription plans, you expressly acknowledge and agree that (1) TP-Link is authorized to charge you a subscription fee (in addition to any applicable taxes) on a monthly or annually recurring basis depending on the billing cycle you choose and the promotion code you apply, if any, for as long as your subscription is in effect, and (2) your subscription is in effect until you cancel it or it is terminated at our discretion because your credit card was declined or you otherwise fail to pay your subscription fee.

### [(b) Plan Modification](#b-plan-modification)

#### [i. Cancellation:](#i-cancellation)

You may cancel your Kasa Care Services paid subscription at any time by downgrading to the Free Package from the "Kasa Care" menu item on the Kasa app. When you cancel a monthly subscription plan, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription plan and are not entitled to a refund. When you cancel an annual subscription plan, you cancel future charges associated with your subscription plan and you are entitled to the applicable prorated refund. For more details refer to our [refund policy](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/2116/). Upon cancellation of your subscription, we may (but are not obligated to) delete any or all of your Kasa Cam recordings stored on our servers, that become inaccessible to you as a result of your cancellation of a paid subscription plan and downgrade to the Free Plan. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your subscription for any reason, with or without notice in accordance with the [Terms Of Use](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/about-us/kasa-terms-of-use/).

#### [ii. Plan Changes:](#ii-plan-changes)

You may change to a different paid subscription plan or change your billing cycle type (Annual vs. Monthly) at any time from the "Kasa Care" menu item on the Kasa app. Changes will take affect immediately or at the end of your billing cycle. For more details refer to our [refund policy](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/2116/). When you make any changes to your subscription, we may (but are not obligated to) delete any or all of your Kasa Cam recordings stored on our servers, that become inaccessible to you as a result of your change in subscription plan.

### [(c) Incorrect Payments](#c-incorrect-payments)

If we charge less or more than the correct or advertised amount on a transaction, we have the right for up to thirty (30) days after such transaction date to complete subsequent transaction attempts in order to rectify the incorrect payment.

### [(d) Pricing](#d-pricing)

Prices of our Kasa Care Services subscription plans are subject to change at any time, but changes will not affect your current subscriptions. In the event that we change the pricing for any Kasa Care Services subscription plan you have purchased, we will give you 30 days advance notice of this change and will take effect on your next billing cycle. After receiving such notice, you will be deemed to have accepted the change in pricing, unless you cancel your subscription as set forth in section (b) above.

[Suspension of video recording](#suspension-of-video-recording)
---------------------------------------------------------------

You may stop video/audio recording from your camera at any time. From the Kasa App, go to the "Privacy" section under "Camera Settings" and select "Do Not Record Video or Audio." For more details, please visit [What is Privacy Model](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/support/faq/1959/). Your choice to stop video/audio recording does not modify or cancel your then existing subscription plan.
