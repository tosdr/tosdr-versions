**18\. Modifications.** Provider reserves the right to alter or revise the terms of this Agreement by giving Customer thirty (30) days’ notice of the changes to be made.

**20\. Relationship of Parties.** No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between Customer and Provider as a result of this Agreement.

**23\.

Arbitration hereunder shall be conducted by one neutral arbitrator appointed by JAMS. The place of arbitration shall be Las Vegas, Nevada. The United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this arbitration clause. Any disputes, including any threshold disagreement about the arbitrability of any claim, shall be delegated to the arbitrator (and not a court). In no event shall the arbitrator have any authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages, except as may be required by statute. In no event shall the arbitrator determine or award any alternative allocation of costs and expenses, including any attorneys’ fees, unless a statute specifically authorizes such an award. The Parties’ respective responsibilities to pay any JAMS filing, administrative, and the arbitrator’s fees will be solely in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Except as otherwise provided herein and irrespective of the outcome of arbitration, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including its own attorneys’ fees. Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. You agree and submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of any such court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration clause is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the remaining terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. YOU SHALL HAVE THIRTY (30) DAYS TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION SECTION BY PROVIDING WRITTEN NOTICE TO US. AFTER THIRTY (30) DAYS, THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION HEREBY BECOME FINAL AND BINDING.**

**24\. Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision will be construed to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision, with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.

**25\. Waiver.** The failure of Provider to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Provider in writing.

**26\. Amendment.**. No amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and executed by both Parties.

**27\. Entire Agreement.** This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between Customer and Provider and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties regarding the subject matter contained herein.
