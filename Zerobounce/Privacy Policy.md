Privacy Policy
==============

This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for [www.zerobounce.net](https://www.zerobounce.net/ "Homepage") (the “Site”), including ZeroBounce’s policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with Your use of the Site and any related email validation services (the “Services”). When You access or use the Site or the Services, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

PARTICIPATION IN EU-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK AND U.K. EXTENSION AND SWISS-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hertza L.L.C. and its divisions/the covered entities, including ZeroBounce, complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Hertza L.L.C. and its divisions/the covered entities, including ZeroBounce, have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Hertza L.L.C. and its divisions/the covered entities, including ZeroBounce, have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

We collect the types of personal data identified under the “Personal Information Collected”. We collect and use such personal information for the purposes identified under the same heading. The types of third parties to which we disclose personal information, and the purposes for such disclosure are also noted above under the same heading.

Pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to You in the United States. Upon request, we will provide You with access to the personal information that we hold about You. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about You. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks, should direct their query by clicking on the "Contact Us" link on the bottom of the Site. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share Your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of Your personal information, please submit a written request by clicking on the "Contact Us" link on the bottom of the Site.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

ZeroBounce’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles. In particular, ZeroBounce remains responsible and liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless ZeroBounce proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

SECURITY
--------

We take precautions to protect Your information. We maintain our Site and Services and all associated data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect Your information offline. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Site or Services that materially affects You or Your Personal Information, we will attempt to notify You as soon as possible.

DATA RETENTION
--------------

We will retain Your Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the Services, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

Further, to the extent that a ZeroBounce customer transfers Personal Information originating in the EU, UK, or Switzerland, we implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the applicable territory. Namely, where transfers are made by ZeroBounce customers in the EU, we incorporate a data processing addendum and the EU standard contractual clauses. Where transfers are made by ZeroBounce customers in the UK, we incorporate a data processing addendum and the UK standard contractual clauses. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Your use of the Site and Services is not intended to subject Us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory other than that of United States. By using the Site and Services, You consent to the transfer of such information to countries outside of Your country of residence, including the United States and the EU, which may have different data protection rules than those of Your country. To the extent that a non-U.S. resident specifically elects to use utilize ZeroBounce’s API server in the United States, it elects to do so at its own risk.

DISPUTES
--------
