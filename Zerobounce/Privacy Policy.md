Privacy Policy
==============

This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for [www.zerobounce.net](https://www.zerobounce.net/ "Homepage") (the “Site”), including ZeroBounce’s policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with Your use of the Site and any related email validation services (the “Services”). When You access or use the Site or the Services, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

PARTICIPATION IN EU-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK AND U.K. EXTENSION AND SWISS-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hertza L.L.C. and its divisions/the covered entities, including ZeroBounce, complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Hertza L.L.C. and its divisions/the covered entities, including ZeroBounce, have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Hertza L.L.C. and its divisions/the covered entities, including ZeroBounce, have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

We collect the types of personal data identified under the “Personal Information Collected”. We collect and use such personal information for the purposes identified under the same heading. The types of third parties to which we disclose personal information, and the purposes for such disclosure are also noted above under the same heading.

Pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to You in the United States. Upon request, we will provide You with access to the personal information that we hold about You. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about You. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks, should direct their query by clicking on the "Contact Us" link on the bottom of the Site. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share Your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of Your personal information, please submit a written request by clicking on the "Contact Us" link on the bottom of the Site.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

ZeroBounce’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles. In particular, ZeroBounce remains responsible and liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless ZeroBounce proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
