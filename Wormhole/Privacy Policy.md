**Ending these Terms.** You may end these Terms with Socket at any time by deleting Wormhole from your device and discontinuing use of our Services.

Our Terms cover the entire agreement between you and Socket regarding our Services. If you do not agree with our Terms, you should stop using our Services.

If we fail to enforce any of our Terms, that does not mean we waive the right to enforce them. If any provision of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from our Terms and shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our Services are not intended for distribution to or use in any country where such distribution or use would violate local law or would subject us to any regulations in another country.
