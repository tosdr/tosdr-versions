1. Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air signed at Montreal on 28 May 1999; or

You are solely responsible for providing to and confirming with the sender the correct Shop and Ship Location, including your personal account number, and you understand that any incorrect information may result in non-delivery or delayed delivery of items, or incurring additional fees under this clause 3 for which you will be held accountable. Any Shipment that is unable to be delivered to you (for reasons including, without limitations, your failure to pay, take delivery, give proper instructions, including failure to clearly address the package, your failure to confirm your shipment is acceptable for entry into the destination country, failure to use correct Shop and Ship Location, failure to update your Delivery Address, or you are unable to be contacted after reasonable attempts to do so) will be deemed an Uncollected Good or Unclaimed Good and Aramex reserves the right to deal with that Shipment in any lawful manner it considers appropriate, which may mean the package is discarded, destroyed, returned to sender, or auctioned.
    
    To ensure delivery of your shipment, you are responsible for confirming items purchased in a Shop and Ship Location are shipped to the corresponding Shop and Ship Location address, and not to a different Shop and Ship Location address, which may result in non-delivery of items due to applicable laws, rules, regulations, etc.
    
4. **Postage or payment outstanding**
    
    Aramex will not accept on your behalf any items on which postage is outstanding and payable or Cash on Delivery items unless prior arrangement has been made by you with Aramex, and Aramex has agreed to it at its sole discretion.

5. **Accountable Mail**
    
    Aramex will not accept certified, registered, insured, or express mail (“Accountable Mail”) on your behalf unless otherwise requested by you and agreed by Aramex subject to certain requirements (see clause 32).

**Indemnification** **and Warranty**

20. You warrant that all information provided by you is complete and accurate.
    
21. You agree to protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless Aramex and its respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent corporations, franchisees, officers, agents, and employees (“Aramex Indemnitees”) against any and all losses, damages, expenses, claims, demands, liabilities, judgments, settlement accounts, penalties, fines or other costs, including reasonable attorney fees and causes of action of any type or nature arising out of or in conjunction with the use of the Account and/or the Service, including without limitation any demands, claims, and causes of action for personal injury or property damage arising from:
    
    a. failure of the respective Shop and Ship Location postal services, other relevant postal authority, or any commercial courier service to deliver on time or otherwise fail to deliver any item and/or package;
    
    b. delay occasioned by treatment handling, examination or impounding of the Goods by any of the Government Authorities;
    
    c. any misdescription or undervaluation provided for Customs purposes, whether intentionally or unintentionally;
    
    d. breach by you of any applicable law or requirement of any Government Authorities; or
    
    e. damage to or loss of any package or Account contents by any cause whatsoever, and from any violation by you of applicable international, federal, state or local laws.
    
22. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, Aramex will not be liable for any costs, expenses, loss or penalties imposed or loss or damage incurred by any Aramex Indemnitee due to your Shipment or Goods being impounded by customs or other Government Authorities, and you hereby protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless each Aramex Indemnitee against any such cost, expense, fine, penalty or loss.
    
23. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, Aramex will not be liable for any costs, expenses, loss, fines, or penalties imposed or loss or damage incurred by any Aramex Indemnitee due to your breach or non-compliance of any of these Terms and Conditions and you hereby protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless each Aramex Indemnitee against any such cost, expense, fine, penalty or loss.
    

**Limitation of Liability**

24. Aramex will be responsible for your Shipment only while it is within Aramex’s custody or control, subject to the limitations of liability set out herein. 
    
25. If the Shipment is transported by air and involves a stop in a country other than the country of departure, you understand and acknowledge that an Airfreight Convention may apply and may limit liability for loss or damage. Your claim for any loss or damage occurring during carriage by air, is against the airline carrier.   In the event of any loss or damage suffered by you while the Goods are in the possession of the airline carrier, Aramex will seek to recover amounts payable under the applicable Airfreight Convention on your behalf, and you will indemnify Aramex and hold it harmless against any claims for loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they were in the possession of the airline carrier.   If the Shipment is carried by international road transportation, the Convention for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR) may apply. This convention limits Aramex’s liability for loss or damage. 
    
26. You acknowledge that Goods moved by airfreight may necessarily involve a part of transport undertaken by other means. Where this is so, and no international treaty is applicable which covers the additional transport, your recovery of loss or damage, if any, is against the carrier and may exclude or substantially limit liability. In the event of any loss or damage suffered by you while the Goods are in the possession of a third-party carrier, Aramex will seek to recover from the carrier any amounts payable to you. You indemnify Aramex and hold it harmless against any claims for loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they are in the possession of the third-party carrier, where such carriage was necessary in order to complete the delivery of your Shipment.
    
27. Without limiting the effect of clauses 20-23, and subject to clauses 28-29 below, in all cases where Aramex’s liability is not otherwise limited or excluded, Aramex’s liability shall be limited to whichever is the lesser between (i) the value of the Goods the subject of the Shipment at the time the Goods were delivered to Aramex, or (ii) US $100 per shipment, or its equivalent per shipment.
    
28. To the extent that the liability of Aramex is limited by any Airfreight Convention, law or contract, and that limitation exceeds the limitation of liability pursuant to clause 27 above or Accountable Mail below, then the liability pursuant to that Airfreight Convention, law or contract shall apply .
    
29. Any claim for loss or damage must be notified in writing to Aramex within seven (7) days of delivery of the Goods or of the date upon which the Goods should have been delivered. In any event, Aramex shall be discharged from all liability whatsoever in connection with the Services and/or the Goods unless proceedings are served within 90 days from delivery of the Goods (or from when they should have been delivered). In the event the Goods are fully compensated by Aramex for any reason, then you will need to send the damaged goods to Aramex in order to receive the compensation for the damaged goods.
    
30. In addition to Aramex’s standard liability above, Aramex offers an additional protection plan for shipments against all risks of physical shipment loss or damage from any external cause. Click here for more details about the Shop and Ship Additional Protection Service.
    
31. **Country Notices**.
    
    a. Qatar Residents. This clause applies to Customers located in Qatar only. The Terms and Conditions are in compliance with the Electronic Commerce and Transaction Law No. 16 of 2010.
    
32. **A****ccountable Mail**
    
    In the event that Aramex agrees to accept Accountable Mail on your behalf, then in consideration for Aramex’s doing so, you agree that Aramex’s liability for loss or damage is limited to the lesser of (i) the value of the Goods, or (ii) US $100.
    
33. **Consequential Losses**
    
    Aramex will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind or any loss of profit, reputation, income, interest, opportunity, contract or bargain.
    

**Force Majeure**

34. Aramex will not be liable to you for any delay, breach or failure to perform its obligations under these Terms and Conditions or any loss, costs or expenses you may incur which are caused or contributed to by an event beyond Aramex’s or its agents’ reasonable control, for example acts of God, fire, flood, natural catastrophes, failure or delay of suppliers or contractors, inability to obtain goods or services necessary to perform the Services, civil disturbances, insurrections, riots, wars (declared or undeclared), act of terrorism, strikes or lock-outs or stoppage or restraint of labour from whatever cause, whether partial or general. 
    

**Privacy**

35. Aramex’s Privacy Policy applies.  A copy of the Privacy Policy is available at: [http://www.shopandship.com/en/termsandconditions](https://staging.shopandship.com/termsandconditions).
    

**Change of Terms and Conditions, Service, and Fees**

36. Aramex may add to or change or update these Terms and Conditions from time to time entirely at its own discretion and without notice to you. Any and all amendments to the Terms and Conditions shall be published on the Shop and Ship website ( [www.shopandship.com](https://staging.shopandship.com/home) ) and shall be effective on the date of publication thereof. You are responsible for checking these Terms of Conditions periodically to remain in compliance with these terms. Your use of the Account or ordering of any Services after any amendment to the Terms and Conditions shall constitute your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, and you also agree to be bound by any such changes/revisions. You are advised to regularly check for any amendments or updates to the Terms and Conditions from time to time, as Aramex shall not be liable to compensate you for your failure to do so.
    
37. The Account Fee, Shipping Fees, and any other related charges stated herein or incidental hereto, as well as the Terms and Conditions are subject to change upon the sole discretion of Aramex at any time whatsoever, and without prior notice to you. There will be no refunds for your cancellation of the Service. Aramex may also change the shipping frequency at any time without providing prior notice to you.
    

**Termination**

38. You agree that Aramex may terminate these Terms and Conditions for good cause at any time and without notice. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: 
    
    a. Your use of the Account for illegal, obscene, or fraudulent purposes or for any purpose prohibited by Aramex, the respective Shop and Ship Location, or other regulations;
    
    b. Your failure to pay monies owed to Aramex when due; and

        Where these fields are completely free, you may use them to disclose, or may post content which discloses (inadvertently or not) more sensitive categories of Personal Data, such as data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. The content you upload in these fields may also (inadvertently or not) include other types of sensitive information relating to you, such as your genetic data, biometric data or data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation.
        
        Aramex asks that you do not disclose any sensitive Personal Data in these free text fields or in your posts on the Website, unless you consider this to be strictly necessary. If you do, then you will be considered as having consented to Aramex’s processing of this Personal Data, which will be considered lawful also due to the fact that you have publicly disclosed it on the Website.
        
        In any case, Aramex would stress the importance of providing your explicit consent to process this sort of Personal Data (e.g., by declaring that you consent to processing in the message you write in the free text fields or posts), if you decide, nonetheless, to share it.
        
        When registering to apply for a position within Aramex, in the “**Careers**” section of the Website (where available), you are also asked to submit (optionally) additional Personal Data, identified as “job-specific information”. Here, you may choose to share information, e.g., regarding any disabilities you may have. As it is totally optional to provide this information, if you do, then you will be considered as having consented to Aramex’s processing of this Personal Data, which will be considered lawful also due to the fact that you have publicly disclosed it on the Website.
        
    * **Other persons’ Personal Data**
        
        As mentioned in the previous section, certain areas of the Website include free text fields where you can write messages to Aramex, or otherwise allow you to post various types of content on the Website. These messages and content may (inadvertently or not) include Personal Data related to other persons.
        
        In other sections of the Website, you are asked to submit Personal Data related to third parties, such as other contact persons in your company or your relatives who are employees of Aramex.
        
        In any situation where you decide to share Personal Data related to other persons, you will be considered as an independent data controller regarding that Personal Data, and must assume all inherent legal obligations and responsibilities. This means, among other things, that you must fully indemnify Aramex against any complaints, claims or demands for compensation for damages which may arise from the processing of this Personal Data, brought by the third parties whose information you provide through the Website.
        
        As Aramex does not collect this information directly from these third parties (but rather collects them, indirectly, from you), you must make sure that you have these third parties’ consent before providing any information regarding them to Aramex; if not, then you must make sure there is some other appropriate grounds on which you can rely to lawfully give Aramex this information.
        
    * **Browsing data**
        
        The Website’s operation, as is standard with any websites on the Internet, involves the use of computer systems and software procedures, which collect information about the Website’s users as part of their routine operation. While Aramex does not collect this information in order to link it to specific users, it is still possible to identify those users either directly via that information, or by using other information collected – as such, this information must also be considered Personal Data.
        
        This information includes several parameters related to your operating system and IT environment, including your IP address, location (country), the domain names of your computer, the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) addresses of resources you request on the Website, the time of requests made, the method used to submit requests to the server, the dimensions of the file obtained in response to a request, the numerical code indicating the status of the response sent by the server (successful, error, etc.), and so on.
        
        These data are used to compile statistical information on the use of the Website, as well as to ensure its correct operation and identify any faults and/or abuse of the Website.
        
    * **Cookies**
        
        _\- Definitions, characteristics, and application of standards_
        
        Cookies are small text files that may be sent to and registered on your computer by the websites you visit, to then be re-sent to those same sites when you visit them again. It is thanks to these cookies that those websites can “remember” your actions and preferences (e.g., login data, language, font size, other display settings, etc.), so that you do not need to configure them again when you next visit the website, or when you change pages within a website.
        
        Cookies are used for electronic authentication, monitoring of sessions and storage of information regarding your activities when accessing a website. They may also contain a unique ID code which allows tracking of your browsing activities within a website, for statistical or advertising purposes. Some operations within a website may not be able to be performed without the use of cookies which, in certain cases, are technically necessary for operation of the website.
        
        When browsing a website, you may also receive cookies from websites or web servers other than the website being visited (i.e., “**third-party cookies**”).
        
        There are various types of cookies, depending on their characteristics and functions, which may be stored on your computer for different periods of time: “**session cookies**”, which are automatically deleted when you close your browser, and “**persistent cookies**”, which will remain on your device until their pre-set expiration period passes.
        
        According to the law which may be applicable to you, your consent may not always be necessary for cookies to be used on a website. In particular, “**technical cookies**” – i.e. cookies which are only used to send messages through an electronic communications network, or which are needed to provide services you request – typically do not require this consent. This includes browsing or session cookies (used to allow users to login) and function cookies (used to remember choices made by a user when accessing the website, such as language or products selected for purchase).
        
        On the other hand, “**profiling cookies**” – i.e., cookies used to create profiles on users and to send advertising messages in line with the preferences revealed by users while browsing websites – typically require specific consent from users, although this may vary according to the applicable law.
        
        _\- Types of cookies used by the Website_
        
        The Website use the following types of cookies:
        
        * **Browsing** or **session cookies**, which are strictly necessary for the Website’s operation, and/or to allow you to use the Website’s content and Services.
        * **Analytics cookies**, which allow Aramex to understand how users make use of the Website, and to track traffic to and from the Website.
        * **Function cookies**, which are used to activate specific Website functions and to configure the Website according to your choices (e.g., language), in order to improve your experience.
        * **Profiling cookies**, which are used to observe the preferences you reveal through your use of the Website and to send you advertising messages in line with those preferences.
        
        Aramex also uses **third-party cookies** – i.e. cookies from websites / web servers other than the Website, owned by third parties. These third parties will either act as independent data controllers from Aramex regarding their own cookies (using the data they collect for their own purposes and under terms defined by them) or as data processors for Aramex (processing personal data on Aramex’s behalf). For further information on how these third parties may use your information, please refer to their privacy policies:

        Aramex uses Google Analytics on the Website. This is a tool developed by Google and used to collect information, which permits evaluation of the use of the Website, analysis of your behaviour and improvement of your experience with the Website. You can obtain more information about how to opt out of Google Analytics at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
        
5. **Purposes of processing**
    
    Aramex intends to use your Personal Data, collected through the Website, for the following purposes:
    
    * To verify your identity and assist you, in case you lose or forget your login / password details for any of Aramex’s registration services, to allow you to participate in the Website’s forums and discussions, by maintaining a registered user profile, as well as managing and registering your participation, and to provide any other Services which you may request (“**Service Provision**”);
        
    * To examine applicant’s resumes / CVs and to get in contact with applicants who have submitted their application via the Website (“**Recruitment**”);
        
    * For future marketing, promotional and publicity purposes, including to allow participation in contests and promotions available via the Website, as well as to carry out direct marketing, market research and surveys, via e-mail, SMS, push notifications, over the phone, through an operator, through Aramex’s official social media pages (“**Marketing**”);
        
    * To create a profile of you as a Website user, through the use of profiling cookies and by collecting and analysing information on the preferences you select and choices you make in the Website, as well as your general activities on the Website. This profile will be used to give you information about other websites / services which Aramex believes you may be interested in, and to show you information and advertisements which may be relevant to you and your interests. All algorithms involved in this processing are regularly tested, to ensure the processing’s fairness and control for bias (“**Profiling**”);
        
    * For compliance with laws which impose upon Aramex the collection and/or further processing of certain kinds of Personal Data (“**Compliance**”);
        
    * For development and administration of the Website, in particular by use of data analytics regarding how you and other users use the Website, as well as the information and feedback you provide, to improve our offerings (“**Analytics**”);
        
    * To prevent and detect any misuse of the Website, or any fraudulent activities carried out through the Website (“**Misuse/Fraud**”).
        
6. **Grounds for processing and mandatory / discretionary nature of processing**
    
    Aramex’s legal bases to process your Personal Data, according to the purposes identified in Section 3, are as follows:
    
    * **Service Provision** : processing for these purposes is necessary to provide the Services and, therefore, is necessary for the performance of a contract with you. It is not mandatory for you to give Aramex your Personal Data for these purposes; however, if you do not, Aramex will not be able to provide any Services to you.
        
    * **Recruitment** : processing for this purpose is needed in order for Aramex to be able to consider offering you a position and, therefore, is necessary to take steps at your request before (potentially) entering into an employment contract. It is not mandatory for you to give Aramex your Personal Data for these purposes; however, if you do not, Aramex will not be able to consider your candidacies.
        
    * **Marketing** : processing for these purposes is based on your consent. It is not mandatory for you to give consent to Aramex for use of your Personal Data for these purposes, and you will suffer no consequence if you choose not to (aside from not being able to receive further marketing communications from Aramex). Any consent given may also be withdrawn at a later stage (please see Section 8 for more information).
        
    * **Profiling** : processing for this purpose is based on your consent, given by accepting the use of profiling cookies. It is not mandatory for you to give consent to Aramex for use of your Personal Data for this purpose, and you will suffer no consequence if you choose not to (aside from not being able to benefit from greater personalisation of your user experience regarding the Website). Any consent given may also be withdrawn at a later stage (please see Section 8 for more information).
        
    * **Compliance** : processing for this purpose is necessary for Aramex to comply with its legal obligations. When you provide any Personal Data to Aramex, Aramex must process it in accordance with the laws applicable to it, which may include retaining and reporting your Personal Data to official authorities for compliance with tax, customs or other legal obligations.
        
    * **Analytics** : Information collected for this purpose is used to allow Aramex to understand how users interact with the Website and to improve the Website accordingly, with the aim to providing a better user experience.
        
    * **Misuse/Fraud**: Information collected for this purpose is used exclusively to prevent and detect fraudulent activities or misuse of the Website (for potentially criminal purposes).
        
7. **Recipients of Personal Data**
    
    Your Personal Data may be shared with the following list of persons / entities (“**Recipients**”):
    
    * Persons, companies or professional firms providing Aramex with advice and consultancy regarding accounting, administrative, legal, tax, financial and debt collection matters related to the provision of the Services;
    * Entities engaged in order to provide the Services (e.g., hosting providers or e-mail platform providers);
    * Entities engaged as data processors, to carry out processing activities related to **Marketing** on Aramex’s behalf, where you have consented to processing of your Personal Data for these purposes (e.g., SMS engines);
    * Persons authorised to perform technical maintenance (including maintenance of network equipment and electronic communications networks);
    * Persons authorised by Aramex to process Personal Data needed to carry out activities strictly related to the provision of the Services, who have undertaken an obligation of confidentiality or are subject to an appropriate legal obligation of confidentiality (e.g., employees of Aramex);
    * Other companies within the Aramex Group; and
    * Public entities, bodies or authorities to whom your Personal Data may be disclosed, in accordance with the applicable law or binding orders of those entities, bodies or authorities;
8. **Transfer of Personal Data**
    
    Considering Aramex’s worldwide presence and business operations, your Personal Data may be transferred to Recipients located in several different countries. Aramex implements appropriate safeguards to ensure the lawfulness and security of these Personal Data transfers, such as by relying on adequacy decisions from the European Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission, or other safeguards or conditions considered adequate to the transfer at hand.
    
9. **Retention of Personal Data**
    
    Personal Data processed for **Service Provision** will be kept by Aramex for the period deemed strictly necessary to fulfil such purposes – in any case, as these Personal Data are processed for the provision of the Services, Aramex may continue to store this Personal Data for a longer period, as may be necessary to protect Aramex’s interests related to potential liability related to the provision of the Services.
    
    Personal Data processed for **Recruitment** will be kept by Aramex for as long as the vacancy for which the CV was submitted is still available or, in case of open positions, for up to 1 year. Aramex may contact applicants before the expiration of this period to request an extension of the retention period.
    
    Personal Data processed for **Marketing** and **Profiling** will be kept by Aramex from the moment you give consent until the moment you withdraw the consent given. Once consent is withdrawn, Personal Data will no longer be used for these purposes, although it may still be kept by Aramex, in particular as may be necessary to protect Aramex’s interests related to potential liability related to this processing.
    
    Personal Data processed for **Compliance** will be kept by Aramex for the period required by the specific legal obligation or by the applicable law.
    
    Personal Data processed for **Analytics** and **Misuse/Fraud** will be kept by Aramex for as long as deemed strictly necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, unless you validly object to the processing of your Personal Data for these purposes (please see Section 8 for further information).
    
10. **Data subjects’ rights**
    
    Under the Regulation, you, as a data subject, are entitled to exercise the following rights before Aramex, at any time:
    
    * Access your Personal Data being processed by Aramex (and/or a copy of that Personal Data), as well as information on the processing of your Personal Data;
        
    * Correct or update your Personal Data processed by Aramex, where it may be inaccurate or incomplete;
        
    * Request erasure of your Personal Data being processed by Aramex, where you feel that the processing is unnecessary or otherwise unlawful;
        
    * Request the restriction of the processing of your Personal Data, where you feel that the Personal Data processed is inaccurate, unnecessary or unlawfully processed, or where you have objected to the processing;
        
    * Exercise your right to portability: the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data provided to Aramex, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, as well as the transmission of that Personal Data to another data controller;
        
    * Object to the processing of your Personal Data, based on relevant grounds related to your particular situation, which you believe must prevent Aramex from processing your Personal Data; or
        
    * Withdraw your consent to processing (for **Marketing** and **Profiling**).
        
    
    Please note that most of the personal information you provide to Aramex can be changed at any time, including your e-mail preferences, by accessing the user profile you can create on the Website.
    
    You can withdraw consent regarding processing for **Marketing** by selecting the appropriate link included at the bottom of every marketing e-mail message received.
    
    Aside from the above means, you can also exercise your rights described above by sending us a support request via the [Website](https://www.aramex.com/us/en/support/submit-privacy-request), or by sending a written request to Aramex at the following address: [privacy@aramex.com](mailto:privacy@aramex.com).
    
    In any case, please note that, as a data subject, you are entitled to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authorities for the protection of Personal Data, if you believe that the processing of your Personal Data carried out through the Website is unlawful.
    
11. **Amendments**
    
    This Privacy Policy entered into force on May 23, 2018. Aramex reserves the right to partly or fully amend this Privacy Policy, or simply to update its content, e.g., as a result of changes in applicable law. Aramex will inform you of such changes as soon as they are introduced, and they will be binding as soon as they are published on the Website. Aramex therefore invites you to regularly visit this Privacy Policy in order to acquaint yourself with the latest, updated version of the Privacy Policy, so that you may remain constantly informed on how Aramex collects and uses Personal Data.
