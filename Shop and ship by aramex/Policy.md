Your use of the Shop and Ship service (“**Service**”) is subject to these terms and conditions (“**Terms and Conditions**”). The Service is provided to you under these Terms and Conditions and any updates thereof or amendments thereto, and any related operating rules and policies that are published from time to time by Aramex on the Shop and Ship website ([www.shopandship.com](http://www.shopandship.com/)).

The Shop and Ship Account (“**Account**”) shall be subject to the following Terms and Conditions:

**Definitions and Interpretation**

“**Shipment**” means all documents or parcels that travel under one waybill and which may be carried by any means Aramex chooses, including air, road or any other carrier. A “waybill” shall include any label produced by Aramex’s automated systems, air waybill, or consignment note and shall incorporate these Terms and Conditions in full.  Every Shipment is transported on a limited liability basis as provided herein.

a. "**Airfreight Convention**" means whichever may be applicable of the:

b. Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air signed at Montreal on 28 May 1999; or

Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929; either unamended or amended by the Hague Protocol 1955; at Guatemala City 1971, by the additional Protocol No 3 of Montreal 1975 and/or by the additional Protocol No. 4 of Montreal 1975.

"**Dangerous Goods**" means cargo which is noxious, hazardous, inflammable, explosive or offensive (including radioactive materials) or may become noxious, hazardous, inflammable, explosive or offensive or radioactive or may become liable to cause damage to any person or property whatsoever whether prescribed by laws or otherwise.

"**Government Authorities**" means, without limitation, all government or semi-governmental departments and agencies with responsibility for the import and export of goods, the collection of revenue on the import and export of goods and the transport of those goods.

**Services**

1\. The Service enables you to make purchases in countries identified [here](https://shopandship.com/ourstory) (and such other countries as may be notified by Aramex from time to time) using a personalized physical address in the respective country (“**Shop and Ship Location**”). On delivery of the purchased item to the respective Shop and Ship Location, Aramex will process the Shipment and arrange for delivery of the item to the address and country stated in the Application Form (“**Delivery Address**”). Shipments cannot be delivered to Post Office box address.

**2\. Registration and appointment of Aramex as your agent**

To register for the Service, you will need to complete the Shop and Ship Application Form (“Application Form”), set up an Account on the Website, and pay the one-time registration fee (“Account Fee”).  Registration for access to the Service is open to individuals who are 18 years of age or older (or the legal age of majority in your country). By registering for our Service you are appointing Aramex as your agent for the receipt of, and organization of transportation for, your packages and you authorize Aramex to receive any and all packages addressed to you that are delivered to the respective Shop and Ship Location.

**3\. Receipt and Delivery**

The Service by Aramex includes the receipt of your packages at the Shop and Ship Location and transporting such packages to your Delivery Address. You are solely responsible for providing to and confirming with the sender the correct Shop and Ship Location, including your personal account number, and you understand that any incorrect information may result in non-delivery or delayed delivery of items, or incurring additional fees under this clause 3 for which you will be held accountable. Any Shipment that is unable to be delivered to you (for reasons including, without limitations, your failure to pay, take delivery, give proper instructions, including failure to clearly address the package, your failure to confirm your Shipment is acceptable for entry into the destination country, failure to use correct Shop and Ship Location, failure to update your Delivery Address, or you are unable to be contacted after reasonable attempts to do so) will be deemed an Uncollected Good or Unclaimed Good and Aramex reserves the right to deal with that Shipment in any lawful manner it considers appropriate, which may mean the package is discarded, destroyed, returned to sender, or auctioned.

The packaging of your Shipment for transportation is solely the shipper’s responsibility. Aramex accepts no responsibility for loss or damage to the Goods caused by inadequate or inappropriate packaging. Aramex has no obligation to repackage any Shipment for any reason. In the event Aramex repackages your Shipment, Aramex will charge you for such repackaging services provided by Aramex.

To ensure delivery of your Shipment, you are responsible for confirming items purchased in a Shop and Ship Location are shipped to the corresponding Shop and Ship Location address, and not to a different Shop and Ship Location address, which may result in non-delivery of items due to applicable laws, rules, regulations, etc.

**4\. Postage or payment outstanding**

Aramex will not accept on your behalf any items on which postage is outstanding and payable or Cash on Delivery items unless prior arrangement has been made by you with Aramex, and Aramex has agreed to it at its sole discretion. Any such agreement may give rise to liens or other interests at law and Aramex reserves the right, notwithstanding the foregoing, to lawfully enforce any such interests howsoever arising.

**5\. Accountable Mail**

Aramex will not accept certified, registered, insured, or express mail (“Accountable Mail”) on your behalf unless otherwise requested by you and agreed by Aramex subject to certain requirements (see clause 32).

**6\. Inspection**

Aramex, without liability, reserves the right to open and inspect all items delivered to the Shop and Ship Location to determine the nature or condition of the Goods or to determine their ownership or destination.

**7\. Service restriction**

Aramex reserves the right to abandon carriage of any Shipment at any time after acceptance when such Shipment could possibly cause damage or delay to other Shipments, equipment or personnel, or when any such carriage is prohibited by law or is in violation of any of these Terms and Conditions.

**Account** **Fee** **and Shipping Fees**

8\. You agree to pay Aramex a one-time Account Fee as identified [here](https://shopandship.com/membership), inclusive of applicable VAT, upon registration for the Service. The Account Fee is non-refundable unless you qualify for the Money Back Guarantee.

9\. Shipping fees will be charged at the rate applicable to your shipment set out in the website (“Shipping Fees”) or as modified by Aramex from time to time. High volume items will be subject to additional fees as set out in the website [here](https://shopandship.com/faq/odd-size-shipments). Shipping Fees are exclusive of all government taxes, and import VAT applicable on total invoice value of goods, including insurance, freight, incidental charges related to transportation, and on custom duties (“Import VAT”), and any other third party charges, including customs duty, that are payable on the shipment of your Goods, and you understand and agree that all such taxes, VAT, import VAT and third party charges will be paid by you prior to or upon delivery of your Shipment. 

a. Switzerland Shop & Ship Location: Shipments delivered to the Switzerland Shop & Ship Location will be subject to: (i) applicable customs clearance fees, or (ii) bonded area fees in relation to any Shipment from outside Switzerland. The aforesaid charges incurred by Aramex shall apply to all Shop and Ship accounts and you will be liable to pay irrespective of you rejecting delivery of the Shipment. Non-payment of said charges may lead to immediate deactivation of your Shop and Ship account.

b. Handling Fee: Aramex is entitled to charge a reasonable handling charge per Shipment in respect to normal handling and administrative functions related to the Service, and you agree to pay such handling fee.

10\. You agree to pay all applicable Shipping Fees and other charges including custom duties and Import VAT for any Shipment that has been ordered on your Account when requested to do so by Aramex and regardless of the person who placed the order. The aforesaid shall apply to all Shop and Ship accounts including individuals’ and entities’ accounts. It is your responsibility to ensure your shipment includes an invoice or you upload an invoice on your Account for the respective Shipment within the mandatory period notified to you. In the event an invoice is not provided, Aramex will have the right to provide an estimated value with no further liability to you should you not provide an invoice or amend the estimated value within the time period included in the email notification sent to you at the time your Shipment is added under your Account, and included under Activity Update and you will be solely responsible for any misdeclaration. You are solely responsible if you or a third party changes the declared value on any Aramex platform, and Aramex assumes no responsibility for such declared value, including a finding of mis-declaration by a Customs authority. Assuming you have provided accurate information for the customs declaration and Customs does not dispute the value, the amount of Import VAT and customs duty actually charged by your country’s Customs authority may differ from the amount you paid Aramex. In the event, the actual customs duty and Import VAT is more than the estimated amount charged by Aramex, Aramex shall have the right to charge you and you will pay the difference, along with any penalty, fine, expense incurred by Aramex due to inaccurate information provided by you.

**Indemnification** **and Warranty**

20\. You warrant that all information provided by you is complete and accurate.

21\. You agree to protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless Aramex and its respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent corporations, franchisees, officers, agents, and employees (“Aramex Indemnitees”) against any and all losses, damages, expenses, claims, demands, liabilities, judgments, settlement accounts, penalties, fines or other costs, including reasonable attorney fees and causes of action of any type or nature arising out of or in conjunction with the use of the Account and/or the Service, including without limitation any demands, claims, and causes of action for personal injury or property damage arising from:

a. failure of the respective Shop and Ship Location postal services, other relevant postal authority, or any commercial courier service to deliver on time or otherwise fail to deliver any item and/or package;

b. delay occasioned by treatment handling, examination or impounding of the Goods by any of the Government Authorities;

d. breach by you of any applicable law or requirement of any Government Authorities; or

22\. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, Aramex will not be liable for any costs, expenses, loss or penalties imposed or loss or damage incurred by any Aramex Indemnitee due to your Shipment or Goods being impounded by customs or other Government Authorities, and you hereby protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless each Aramex Indemnitee against any such cost, expense, fine, penalty or loss.

23\. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms and Conditions, Aramex will not be liable for any costs, expenses, loss, fines, or penalties imposed or loss or damage incurred by any Aramex Indemnitee due to your breach or non-compliance of any of these Terms and Conditions and you hereby protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless each Aramex Indemnitee against any such cost, expense, fine, penalty or loss.

**Limitation of Liability**

24\. Aramex will be responsible for your Shipment only while it is within Aramex’s custody or control, subject to the limitations of liability set out herein. 

25\. If the Shipment is transported by air and involves a stop in a country other than the country of departure, you understand and acknowledge that an Airfreight Convention may apply and may limit liability for loss or damage. Your claim for any loss or damage occurring during carriage by air, is against the airline carrier.  In the event of any loss or damage suffered by you while the Goods are in the possession of the airline carrier, Aramex will seek to recover amounts payable under the applicable Airfreight Convention on your behalf, and you will indemnify Aramex and hold it harmless against any claims for loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they were in the possession of the airline carrier.  If the Shipment is carried by international road transportation, the Convention for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR) may apply. This convention limits Aramex’s liability for loss or damage. 

26\. You acknowledge that Goods moved by airfreight may necessarily involve a part of transport undertaken by other means. Where this is so, and no international treaty is applicable which covers the additional transport, your recovery of loss or damage, if any, is against the carrier and may exclude or substantially limit liability. In the event of any loss or damage suffered by you while the Goods are in the possession of a third-party carrier, Aramex will seek to recover from the carrier any amounts payable to you. You indemnify Aramex and hold it harmless against any claims for loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they are in the possession of the third-party carrier, where such carriage was necessary in order to complete the delivery of your Shipment.

27\. Without limiting the effect of clauses 20-23, and subject to clauses 28-29 below, in all cases where Aramex’s liability is not otherwise limited or excluded, Aramex’s liability shall be limited to whichever is the lesser between (i) the value of the Goods the subject of the Shipment at the time the Goods were delivered to Aramex, or (ii) US $100 per shipment, or its equivalent per shipment.

28\. To the extent that the liability of Aramex is limited by any Airfreight Convention, law or contract, and that limitation exceeds the limitation of liability pursuant to clause 27 above or Accountable Mail below, then the liability pursuant to that Airfreight Convention, law or contract shall apply.

29\. Any claim for loss or damage must be notified in writing to Aramex within seven (7) days of delivery of the Goods or of the date upon which the Goods should have been delivered. In any event, Aramex shall be discharged from all liability whatsoever in connection with the Services and/or the Goods unless proceedings are served within 90 days from delivery of the Goods (or from when they should have been delivered). In the event the Goods are fully compensated by Aramex for any reason, then you will need to send the damaged goods to Aramex in order to receive the compensation for the damaged goods.

30\. In addition to Aramex’s standard liability above, Aramex offers an additional protection plan for shipments against all risks of physical shipment loss or damage from any external cause. Click here for more details about the [Shop and Ship Additional Protection Service](https://new.shopandship.com/protect). You will be automatically enrolled for the Shop and Ship Additional Protection Service for each Shipment until such time you expressly opt-out of the Shop and Ship Additional Protection Service by updating the status in your Account.

**31\. Country Notices**.

a. Qatar Residents. This clause applies to Customers located in Qatar only. The Terms and Conditions are in compliance with the Electronic Commerce and Transaction Law No. 16 of 2010.

**32\. Accountable Mail**

In the event that Aramex agrees to accept Accountable Mail on your behalf, then in consideration for Aramex’s doing so, you agree that Aramex’s liability for loss or damage is limited to the lesser of (i) the value of the Goods, or (ii) US $100.

**33\. Consequential Losses**

Aramex will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind or any loss of profit, reputation, income, interest, opportunity, contract or bargain.

**Force Majeure**

34\. Aramex will not be liable to you for any delay, breach or failure to perform its obligations under these Terms and Conditions or any loss, costs or expenses you may incur which are caused or contributed to by an event beyond Aramex’s or its agents’ reasonable control, for example acts of God, fire, flood, natural catastrophes, failure or delay of suppliers or contractors, inability to obtain goods or services necessary to perform the Services, civil disturbances, insurrections, riots, wars (declared or undeclared), act of terrorism, strikes or lock-outs or stoppage or restraint of labour from whatever cause, whether partial or general. 

**Privacy**

35\. Aramex’s Privacy Policy applies to these Terms and Conditions.  A copy of the Privacy Policy is available [here](https://new.shopandship.com/termsandconditions#pstab2).

**Change of Terms and Conditions, Service, and Fees**

36\. Aramex may add to or change or update these Terms and Conditions from time to time entirely at its own discretion and without notice to you. Any and all amendments to the Terms and Conditions shall be published on the Shop and Ship website ([www.shopandship.com](http://www.shopandship.com/)) and shall be effective on the date of publication thereof. You are responsible for checking these Terms of Conditions periodically to remain in compliance with these terms. Your use of the Account or ordering of any Services after any amendment to the Terms and Conditions shall constitute your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, and you also agree to be bound by any such changes/revisions. You are advised to regularly check for any amendments or updates to the Terms and Conditions from time to time, as Aramex shall not be liable to compensate you for your failure to do so.

37 The Account Fee, Shipping Fees, and any other related charges stated herein or incidental hereto, as well as the Terms and Conditions are subject to change upon the sole discretion of Aramex at any time whatsoever, and without prior notice to you. There will be no refunds for your cancellation of the Service. Aramex may also change the shipping frequency at any time without providing prior notice to you.

**Termination**

38\. You agree that Aramex may terminate these Terms and Conditions for good cause at any time and without notice. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to: 

a. Your use of the Account for illegal, obscene, or fraudulent purposes or for any purpose prohibited by Aramex, the respective Shop and Ship Location, or other regulations;

b. Your failure to pay monies owed to Aramex when due; and

c. Your violation of any provision of these Terms and Conditions or any provision of any related operating rules and policies that are published by Aramex on Shop and Ship website ([www.shopandship.com](http://www.shopandship.com/)).

39\. You acknowledge that, for the purpose of determining good cause for termination of these Terms and Conditions as provided herein, the actions of any person authorized by you to use your Account or the Service will be attributed to you.

40\. Aramex reserves the right to immediately terminate the Service upon suspicion of any of the activities stated in clauses 11-15 above, and shall not be liable to compensate you for such termination.

41\. You may terminate these Terms and Conditions and close the Account by providing Aramex with 30 days prior written notice. Aramex reserves the right to refuse to accept any dispatch and/or package delivered to your Account after the termination date.

**Miscellaneous**

42\. Aramex may discard, destroy, donate, or auction your Goods within (a) thirty (30) days after receipt of unknown shipments, or (b) twenty-one (21) days after receipt of prohibited shipments, or high-value shipments, or shipments under an inactive account, if: (i) all applicable shipping charges have not been paid; (ii) the mail and/or packages were not clearly identified as belonging to you; (iii) you do not claim the mail or packages received to your Account, (iv) shipment was abandoned at customs, or (v) if Aramex has terminated the Terms and Conditions for good cause as set forth in clause 38 above. Notwithstanding the above, Aramex may destroy any pornographic materials or products and all other related content of whatever type immediately upon delivery to your Account.

43\.

You agree to pay all charges, including applicable taxes, in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time the price or charge becomes payable. If an error has been made in the amount of taxes collected by Aramex with respect to your purchase, we reserve the right to process an additional charge in order to meet our obligations to collect such taxes in the correct amount as required by applicable law.

**(d) Modification of Pricing and Billing Terms**.

If we terminate your right to use and/or access to the Flex Service, without cause, we agree to refund to you the pro-rata portion of Annual Subscription Fee. Any determination of the amount to be returned to you in the event of any such termination shall be made by Aramex in its reasonable discretion, and shall be conclusive and binding.

Aramex may also be able to collect and process information regarding other persons in this same manner, where those customers / users / consignees choose to provide it to Aramex.

This information may be classified as “**Personal Data**”, and can be collected by Aramex both when shared by customers / users / consignees (e.g., upon signing up for an account on an Aramex website, when placing an order for delivery services, when preparing a shipping document at retail outlets), by analysing users’ behaviour (e.g., when browsing Aramex websites or using Aramex applications) or when disclosed to Aramex by other sources (e.g., Aramex’s customers, entities providing sanction-list screening services to Aramex).

These Personal Data may include the following categories:

1. **Name, contact details and other Personal Data**

This may include your name, surname, telephone number, address, delivery address, copies of your government-issued identification cards and information related to your credit card (if you use these cards as a payment method). You can find the relevant information relating to each Aramex’s physical retail outlet stores [here](https://www.aramex.com/us/en/support/find-office).

This is also the case regarding information which you choose to disclose in certain sections of Aramex websites which allow your participation in public forums, or the sending of messages directly to Aramex.

* _Aramex applications_

When creating an account on Aramex applications, you will be asked to submit Personal Data concerning yourself, such as your name (first and last), mobile number, e-mail address and information regarding the credit card to be used as a payment method – number, name, expiry date and card verification number – as well as your shipping address (based on your location, or selected on a map).

* _Consignees_

Aramex may receive Personal Data concerning yourself from its customers, in order to allow Aramex to complete shipments from those customers to you, as a consignee. In this case, Aramex may also collect Personal Data from you upon shipment delivery. This may include, in particular, your name, surname, telephone number, address and delivery address, as well as, in certain cases, copies of your government-issued identification cards and information related to your credit card (if you use these cards as a payment method, where applicable).

2. **Data related to users’ devices**

* _Aramex mobile applications_

When choosing to install Aramex applications, you grant permission to Aramex to set up the selected application on your mobile device (“ **Device**”), as well as to access Personal Data and other information stored on your Device which are needed in order to successfully install the application (e.g., Device model, operating system version, screen resolution, network connection type, language, etc.). This collection of information is inherent to the process of installing and setting up Aramex’s applications and, as such, you may not object to it unless you uninstall the application from your Device.

Once an Aramex application has been installed, you may be asked to allow the application to send and read SMS messages from your Device, in order to send you an SMS verification code and to grant you automatic access to the application, upon successful receipt of this code. When using Aramex applications, access may also be requested to your Device’s storage (e.g., when you register shipping addresses on an application), camera (e.g., so that you can scan your credit card in order to insert its details as a payment method in the applications) and Internet access, among other functions where necessary.

3. **Data related to your location**

* _Aramex mobile applications_

Once you have installed an Aramex application, you may be asked to consent to the application accessing your Device’s location, even when you are not using the application, as well as to your Device’s map functionalities. This is meant to allow Aramex to provide more precise and useful Aramex Services to you via the application, in particular, by allowing you to pinpoint your location, register a shipping address based on your current location (as opposed to searching on a map), track your shipments in real-time (on the day of delivery), ensure correct delivery of your shipments, and so on.

If you believe that the continuous access to your location is too invasive, you can configure your Device in a way to share your position only when the applications are in use. If even this is too invasive, you can always revoke the sharing of your position from the Device settings and simply provide a physical address, zip code or state for the Aramex Services you are interested in (or manually pin your relevant address on a map within the applications).

4. **Call recordings**

When you contact Aramex’s Customer Support team over the phone, Aramex will store a recording of the call held between you and the Aramex Customer Support agent – this is done, primarily, to retain evidence of service-related requests or complaints handled over the phone (to allow Aramex to demonstrate how they were handled), and for service quality monitoring/training purposes. You will be notified of this through a pre-recorded message presented at the start of the call.

5. **Shipment Inspection**

In order to lawfully provide the Aramex Services, Aramex may be required to physically inspect the shipments which are to be delivered in connection with those Aramex Services, in particular to confirm that any applicable legal shipment restrictions (e.g., due to country of origin or destination, or type of goods shipped) or trade embargoes are respected.

These inspections will be carried out only to detect whether the terms of any applicable legal restrictions regarding incoming and outgoing shipments are respected. In particular, Aramex will not carry out an in-depth inspection of any documents or other items which might reveal Personal Data on the sender, consignee or third persons, unless this is strictly necessary for these compliance purposes. As a result of an inspection, if your shipment is rejected (due to a conflict with, for example, applicable legal import or export restrictions), Aramex will either attempt to arrange for the return of the shipment to its origin (where legally possible to do so) or destroy the shipment, as required by the applicable laws.

Aramex maintains logs of all inspection activities performed, including details on the origin and destination countries of the shipment, the name of the shipper and consignee, a general description of the shipment contents (e.g., “documents”, “shower curtains”, etc.), the country of origin of those contents, the contents’ Harmonized System (HS) code, and the air waybill number for the shipment.

6. **Shipment history**

Aramex will keep logs of details, actions taken and interactions had with you in connection with deliveries made at your request (as a shipper), as well as of deliveries made to you (as a consignee). This may include information such as shipment order date/time, shipment contents (generic description), shipper details (name, contact details, billing address), consignee details (name, contact details, delivery address), delivery method, delivery status, delivery date/time, delivery location, number of failed delivery attempts, preferred communication channel for delivery updates, number of returned deliveries, and so on.

These data will be collected from shipment records, but also from logs generated from the different channels through which you may interact with Aramex (such as our applications and websites, our call centres and SMS/instant messaging channels).

7. **Special categories of Personal Data**

Aramex does not typically need to process more sensitive categories of Personal Data, such as data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or other types of sensitive information relating to you, such as your genetic data, biometric data or data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation, in order to provide the Aramex Services. Though this information may potentially be inferred from some of the Personal Data collected by Aramex (e.g., goods to be shipped), it is not the intention of Aramex to process those categories of Personal Data, and those categories of Personal Data will not be specifically processed for any purpose (other than to provide the Aramex Services).

* _Aramex websites and applications_

Certain areas of Aramex websites and applications may include free text fields where you can write messages to Aramex, or otherwise allow you to post various types of content, which may contain Personal Data. Where these fields are completely free, you may use them to disclose, or may post content which discloses (inadvertently or not) more sensitive categories of Personal Data such as data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. The content you upload in these fields may also (inadvertently or not) include other types of sensitive information relating to you, such as your genetic data, biometric data or data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation

Aramex asks that you do not disclose any sensitive Personal Data in these free text fields or in your posts on Aramex websites or applications, unless you consider this to be strictly necessary. While Aramex does not intend to collect sensitive Personal Data on customers or website / application users (except where this is explicitly stated by Aramex), this may occur where those individuals voluntarily choose to disclose those data.

If you do disclose sensitive Personal Data to Aramex in this manner, then Aramex will process those Personal Data only to the extent that they are adequate, relevant and not excessive regarding the purposes of processing described in this Privacy Policy (see below, Purposes of processing). This will be done, in particular, where necessary to perform a contract with you or to answer a request you make, or otherwise where Aramex can be said to have a legitimate interest in processing those data, due also to the fact that, when you decide to disclose sensitive Personal Data through Aramex websites and applications, you may be manifestly making those Personal Data public.

8. **Personal Data related to criminal convictions and offences**

In order to lawfully provide the Aramex Services, Aramex may be required to screen customers / users / consignees against applicable government denied parties, sanctions and watch lists, as well as politically exposed persons databases. Aramex may also be required to confirm whether its customers or users are allowed to export goods outside of their country of location upon requesting Aramex Services, and/or that customers / users / consignees meet other requirements necessary for customs clearance purposes.

This process may involve asking for a copy of your national identification documents or passport, as well as accessing information on prior sanctions or limitations (of a criminal nature or otherwise) which may have been imposed upon you by order of a court or other competent authority. Aramex will only access this information where this is authorised under the applicable law, and solely to the extent necessary to comply with any legal requirements which may apply.

As a result of a screening exercise, if you are identified as a partial or potential match on any applicable lists, you may be asked to provide further information to confirm your identity (such as a copy of your national identification documents or passport, if you have not been asked for this already). If you are identified as an exact match, Aramex will not be able to complete your shipment; in this case, Aramex will either attempt to arrange for the return of the shipment to its origin (where legally possible to do so) or destroy the shipment, as required by the applicable laws.

Aramex maintains logs of all screening activities performed, including details on the origin and destination countries of the shipment, the name of the shipper and consignee, a general description of the shipment contents (e.g., “documents”, “shower curtains”, etc.), the country of origin of those contents, the contents’ Harmonized System (HS) code, and the air waybill number for the shipment.

9. **Other persons’ Personal Data**

When requesting Aramex Services, you may decide to provide information on other persons which is relevant for the correct provision of those services (e.g., where you wish to have a delivery made to another person – i.e., a consignee – you will be required to provide information on the consignee). This may include information such as those persons’ name, delivery address and phone number.

In any situation where you decide to share Personal Data related to other persons, you will be considered as an independent data controller regarding those Personal Data, and must assume all inherent legal obligations and responsibilities. This means, among other things, that you must fully indemnify Aramex against any complaints, claims or demands for compensation for damages which may arise from the processing of this Personal Data, brought by the third parties whose information you provide to Aramex.

As Aramex does not collect this information directly from these third parties (but rather collects them, indirectly, from you), you must make sure that you have these third parties’ consent before providing any information regarding them to Aramex; if not, then you must make sure there is some other appropriate grounds on which you can rely to lawfully give Aramex this information.

* _Aramex websites and applications_

Additionally, as mentioned in the previous section, certain areas of the Aramex websites / applications include free text fields where you can write messages to Aramex, or which otherwise allow you to post various types of content. These messages and content may (inadvertently or not) include Personal Data related to other persons. Other sections of Aramex’s websites may ask you to submit Personal Data related to third parties, such as other contact persons in your company or your relatives who are employees of Aramex.

The final two paragraphs of the above subsection (regarding your liability for Personal Data on other persons which you choose to share with Aramex, and your obligation to ensure that you are lawfully entitled to do so) also apply in full in this case.

10. **Browsing data**

* _Aramex websites and applications_

The operation of Aramex’s websites and applications involves the use of computer systems and software procedures, which collect information about website and application users as part of their routine operation. While Aramex does not collect this information in order to link it to specific users, it is still possible to identify those users either directly via that information, or by using other information collected – as such, this information must also be considered Personal Data.

This information includes several parameters related to your operating system and IT environment, including your IP address, location (country), the domain names of your computer, the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) addresses of resources you request on the websites or applications, the time of requests made, the method used to submit requests to the server, the dimensions of the file obtained in response to a request, the numerical code indicating the status of the response sent by the server (successful, error, etc.), and so on.

These data are used to compile statistical information on the use of the websites and applications, as well as to ensure their correct operation and identify any faults and/or abuse.

11. **Cookies, SDKs and tracking technologies**

Aramex may process your Personal Data through cookies, SDKs (Software Development Kits) and similar technologies to improve your experience on Aramex’s websites or Aramex applications.

* _Aramex websites_

Information regarding the use of cookies on each of our websites can be found in the Cookie Policy made available on each website.

* _Aramex applications_

Information regarding the use of SDKs and tracking technologies on Aramex applications can be found in the SDK Policy which is made available on each applications.

This information will be used to personalise the Aramex Services provided through the websites and applications, where possible, to suit your preferences and choices, as well as to serve you with information and advertisements which may be relevant to you and your interests. All algorithms involved in this processing are regularly tested, to ensure the processing’s fairness and control for bias (“**Profiling**”);

* To keep records of requests, complaints or transactions carried out over the phone between you and an Aramex Customer Support agent, to prove that those requests, complaints or transactions took place at a given date and time, as well as for quality assurance purposes – namely, to incidentally confirm that Aramex Customer Support agents provide high-quality support to Aramex customers (“ **Call Recording**”);

* For compliance with laws which impose upon Aramex the collection and/or further processing of certain kinds of Personal Data (“ **Compliance**”);

4. **Grounds for processing and mandatory / discretionary nature of processing**

Aramex’s legal bases to process your Personal Data, according to the purposes identified in Purposes of processing above, are as follows:

* **Service Provision** : processing for these purposes is necessary to provide the Services and, therefore, is necessary for the performance of a contract with you.

* **Call Recording** : processing for this purpose is generally based on Aramex’s legitimate interests, namely, in retaining evidence of requests, complaints and transactions carried out with Aramex customers over the phone – so that Aramex can demonstrate when they took place, and ensure that they are properly addressed by Aramex – and in ensuring that Aramex Customer Support agents provide high-quality assistance to Aramex customers (by incidentally reviewing calls held by each agent). You are allowed to object to this, and also to ask for more information about the assessment carried out by Aramex regarding its legitimate interests, by sending us a support request (please see Data subjects' rights, below, for more information).

In some jurisdictions, Aramex may not be legally allowed to record phone calls you take part in without your consent.

When you provide any Personal Data to Aramex, Aramex must process it in accordance with the laws applicable to it, which may include retaining and reporting your Personal Data to official authorities for compliance with tax, customs or other legal obligations.

In some cases – notably regarding screening of senders/consignees against existing blacklists or the inspection of shipments – Aramex may base the related processing activities on its legitimate interests, namely, in ensuring that any applicable shipment restrictions are complied with. You are allowed to object to this, and also to ask for more information about the assessment carried out by Aramex regarding its legitimate interests by sending us a support request (please see Data subjects' rights, below, for more information).

* **Analytics** : processing for this purpose is generally based on Aramex’s legitimate interests, namely, in understanding how users interact with Aramex’s websites and applications through collected browsing data and to improve them accordingly, with the aim to providing a better user experience. You are allowed to object to this, and also to ask for more information about the assessment carried out by Aramex regarding its legitimate interests by sending us a support request (please see Data subjects’ rights, below, for more information).

Where Statistics cookies or SDKs are specifically used to collect this information (see Cookies, SDKs and tracking technologies, above), this is based on your consent, given by accepting the use of Statistics cookies or SDKs (see Cookies, SDKs and tracking technologies, above).

6. **Transfer of Personal Data**

Considering Aramex’s worldwide presence and business operations, your Personal Data may be transferred to Recipients located in several different countries. In particular, whenever you rely on Aramex Services for any cross-border operations (such as the delivery of a shipment from one country to another), Personal Data may be transferred to the receiving country.

Aramex implements appropriate safeguards to ensure the lawfulness and security of these Personal Data transfers, in particular regarding transfers of Personal Data from within the EEA to outside the EEA. As a rule, whenever [an adequacy decision from the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) is not available for the recipient country, Aramex enters into agreements with recipients containing [standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en), or otherwise relies on any other more appropriate lawful transfer mechanisms available under the applicable data protection law.

7. **Retention of Personal Data**

Personal Data processed for **Service Provision** will be kept by Aramex for the period deemed strictly necessary to fulfil such purposes – in any case, as these Personal Data are processed for the provision of Aramex Services, Aramex may continue to store this Personal Data for a longer period, as may be necessary to protect Aramex’s interests concerning potential liability linked to the provision of Aramex Services.

Personal Data processed for **Service Analytics**, as well as **Analytics** which are based on Aramex’s legitimate interests (analytics performed on browsing data; see Purposes of processing, above), will be aggregated as soon as feasible, and thus will be kept as Personal Data only for the period deemed strictly necessary to allow for such aggregation.

Personal Data processed for **Analytics**, where based on your consent (analytics performed using Statistical cookies or SDKs; see Purposes of processing, above), will be kept by Aramex from the moment you give consent until the moment you withdraw the consent given. Once consent is withdrawn, Personal Data will no longer be used for these purposes, although it may still be kept by Aramex, in particular as may be necessary to protect Aramex’s interests concerning potential liability linked to this processing.

Personal Data processed for **Marketing** and **Profiling** will be kept by Aramex from the moment you give consent until the moment you withdraw the consent given. Once consent is withdrawn, Personal Data will no longer be used for these purposes, although it may still be kept by Aramex, in particular as may be necessary to protect Aramex’s interests concerning potential liability linked to this processing.

Personal Data processed for **Call Recording** (in particular, the recordings themselves) will be kept by Aramex, as a rule, for up to 1 year from the date on which a call to the Aramex Customer Support team is made. In jurisdictions where Aramex may only legally record phone calls you take part in with your consent, call recordings may be retained from the moment you give consent until the moment you withdraw the consent given.

However, in the event that selected call recordings are reasonably necessary for Aramex to establish, exercise or defend against legal claims, or otherwise to protect Aramex’s interests concerning potential liability linked to the provision of the Aramex Services, they may be kept for a longer period.

Personal Data processed for **Compliance** will be kept by Aramex for the period required by the specific legal obligation or by the applicable law. In particular, logs related to screening or inspection exercises carried out by Aramex will be kept for up to 5 years, after which they will be archived. Archived logs will only be accessed where this is reasonably necessary for Aramex to establish, exercise or defend against legal claims, or otherwise to protect Aramex’s interests concerning potential liability linked to the provision of the Aramex Services.

Personal Data processed for **Misuse/Fraud** will be kept by Aramex for as long as deemed strictly necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, unless you validly object to the processing of your Personal Data for these purposes (please see Data subjects' rights, below, for further information).

8. **Data subjects’ rights**

Under the Regulation, you, as a data subject, are entitled to exercise the following rights before Aramex, at any time:

Regarding processing purposes which are based on our legitimate interests (see Purposes of processing, above) **you are also entitled to object to the processing of your Personal Data**, based on relevant grounds related to your particular situation, which you believe must prevent Aramex from processing your Personal Data. If you do, then we will only continue processing your Personal Data for the purpose in question if we can demonstrate that we have a compelling legitimate interest to continue doing so, or if we need to in order to establish, exercise or defend against any legal claims.

Fraud Prevention
================

**Our Commitment to Protection**

At Aramex, we take protecting our customers' sensitive information seriously and are constantly monitoring our information and data to prevent fraudulent or suspicious behavior.

We strive to protect you and encourage you to be aware of any potential fraudulent behavior by malicious parties using the Aramex brand. Below are some tips for how you can recognize fraud to ensure that sensitive information is kept secure.

**Recognize Fraud**

Recognizing phishing and scam e-mails and other types of communications is key to protecting yourself against fraud and theft. Common warning signs of online scams include:

* **Requests for Money:** Unexpected requests for money in return for delivery of a package, often with a sense of urgency, and used to trick people into sending money and provide personal information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.
* **Requests for Personal Information:** Requests for personal and/or financial information for the purpose of committing theft, identify theft and other crimes.
* **Deceptive Domain Names:** Links to misspelled or slightly altered website addresses (e.g. aramx.com / aramxpress.org / aramexcourier). If you doubt the integrity of any website using the Aramex brand, please visit our global website: [www.aramex.com](http://www.aramex.com/) or contact Aramex Global Customer Care Center at [GlobalCareCenter@aramex.com](mailto:GlobalCareCenter@aramex.com).

**Types of Fraud**

Fraudulent Emails and Email Scams: These are the most common online scams. Such emails attempt to trick you by pretending to come from a reputable source, such as from Aramex (for example from what appears to be an Aramex email). They will try to get you to share sensitive personal, account information or send a payment. They may also ask you to enroll in winning a prize or entering a competition.

We urge customers to be suspicious of any request not coming directly from an Aramex employee or domain name.

**Identity Theft:** This occurs when someone tricks you into disclosing/providing personal, financial or account information. Posing as well-known companies, information thieves usually send out e-mails or contact you by telephone asking you to reply or direct you to a fraudulent web page that asks you to provide personal information, such as your credit card number or account password, or even your Aramex credentials.

**Credit Card Fraud:** In some instances, credit card fraud occurs when someone's physical credit card is lost or stolen by another party who uses it. Credit card fraud is driven primarily by the compromise of credit card account data during their normal course of usage. Stolen credit card data is often used to attempt fraudulent online purchases.

**Spam and Viruses:** In our industry, customers usually receive an email suggesting that Aramex is attempting to deliver a package and request that you open the email attachment to prompt the delivery. This attachment may be a computer virus. Unless you are expecting to receive an email like this, please do not open the attachment and report it to Aramex Global Customer Care Center at ([GlobalCareCenter@aramex.com](mailto:GlobalCareCenter@aramex.com)).

**Package Tracking Emails:** In some cases, customers receive an email containing a tracking number. This number can be verified by inserting it into the “Track Shipment” box on [www.aramex.com](http://www.aramex.com/). If there are no tracking results returned, it is not a valid tracking number, and Aramex did not send the email. Please report this email to Aramex Global Customer Care Center at ([GlobalCareCenter@aramex.com](mailto:GlobalCareCenter@aramex.com)).

**Activation Key:** Messages with activation keys are only sent to complete your registration after downloading the Aramex mobile app. If you receive messages without attempting to register on our mobile app, then we urge you to ignore it. Aramex will never ask for you activation key over phone or email; for your account’s security, please do not share your key with anyone.

**Doing Our Part**

The security of your personal information is important to us. At Aramex, we recognize industry standards and employs appropriate administrative, technical and physical security safeguards to protect the personal information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing.

SDK POLICY
==========

The Aramex Group (“**Aramex**”) has drafted this SDK Policy in order to explain Aramex’s policy regarding the use of any personal information it collects on visitors and users of the Aramex applications through SDKs (Software Development Kits) and similar technologies. This SDK Policy’s goal is to allow those visitors and users to understand how their personal information may be handled by Aramex through SDKs, as well as the rights they have in relation to their personal information.

In general, Aramex will handle personal information collected through SDKs, in a lawful, fair, and transparent manner. Aramex has considered internationally recognised principles on the protection of personal data when defining its policies, such as the principles of purpose limitation, storage limitation, data minimisation, data quality and confidentiality.

The controller regarding all personal data processing carried out via SDKs and similar technologies that Aramex uses on Aramex applications, is **Aramex International LLC**, with registered offices at P.O. Box 95946, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

You can exercise your rights as a Data Subject against Aramex by submitting an online support request ([here](https://www.aramex.com/support/submit-privacy-request)), or by sending a written request to Aramex at the following address: [privacy@aramex.com](mailto:privacy@aramex.com). Aramex has also appointed a Group Data Protection Officer. To contact the Aramex DPO, please submit an online support request ([here](https://www.aramex.com/support/submit-privacy-request)).

**This SDK Policy is a part of Aramex’s Privacy Policy**. For more information regarding Aramex’s personal data processing activities, please read the Aramex’s Privacy Policy (accessible [here](https://www.shopandship.com/en/privacy-policy)).

**SDKs and Tracking Technologies**

SDKs and similar technologies are systems that allow applications to record and/or read information on your Device. In general, these technologies allow an analysis of the use of an application, with the goal to avoid malfunctions and improve users’ experience.

In its applications, Aramex uses SDKs and similar technologies which may be managed directly by Aramex, or otherwise provided by third parties. These third parties act, as the case may be, as independent data controllers from Aramex (using the data they collect for their own purposes and under terms defined by them) or as data processors for Aramex (processing personal data on Aramex’s behalf). For further details on how these third parties may use your information, please refer to their privacy policies (provided below whenever available).
