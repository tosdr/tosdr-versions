In addition to the foregoing, we have integrated Google Analytics into the Services. 

Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the gathering, collection and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects data on which website directed a User to the Services (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. We mainly use this analysis to optimize our websites and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising. 

The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. 

Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Services is usually transmitted to and stored in a Google server in the United States. Google might transfer the Personal Information collected via this technical procedure to third party sub processors to accomplish the purpose for which we use Google Analytics. 

On behalf of the Company, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the Services, compile reports on the Services, and to provide us with further services related to the Services. The IP address transferred through your browser to Google Analytics will not be combined with other data held by Google.

Additionally, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.

**N. Information Security**  

We work hard to protect our Users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections. However, since no software or storage system is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information associated with the Services, or any other service for that matter. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, you agree and acknowledge that: (i) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet and wireless and mobile networks which are beyond our control; and (ii) security, integrity, and privacy of all information and data exchanged between you and us cannot be guaranteed. You can help protect your account information by using unique and hard-to-guess passwords, ensuring no one else uses your device or computer when you are logged in, logging off from the Services when they are not in use, by keeping your password and other information confidential, and by taking precautionary steps to guard the physical safety and security of your device or computer.
