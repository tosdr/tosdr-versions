Among other things, a web analysis service collects data on which website directed a User to the Services (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. We mainly use this analysis to optimize our websites and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.

Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Services is usually transmitted to and stored in a Google server in the United States.

Additionally, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.

We work hard to protect our Users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections.

As a result, while we strive to protect your information, you agree and acknowledge that: (i) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet and wireless and mobile networks which are beyond our control; and (ii) security, integrity, and privacy of all information and data exchanged between you and us cannot be guaranteed. You can help protect your account information by using unique and hard-to-guess passwords, ensuring no one else uses your device or computer when you are logged in, logging off from the Services when they are not in use, by keeping your password and other information confidential, and by taking precautionary steps to guard the physical safety and security of your device or computer.
