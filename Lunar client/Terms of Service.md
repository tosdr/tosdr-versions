In furtherance of the foregoing, you hereby waive any applicable law or statute, which says, in substance: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.”

**20\. Indemnification**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents and assigns from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, debt, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from (i) your misuse of and access to the Services; (ii) your violation of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, intellectual property, or privacy right; (iv) your use of or inability to use the Services; and (v) any claim that you caused damage to a third-party.

**21\. Dispute Resolution**

In the event the parties are not able to resolve any Dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then, except as provided below, the parties hereby agree to submit any dispute they cannot resolve informally to final and binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in New Castle County, Delaware before a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator will follow Delaware law in adjudicating the dispute. The arbitrator will provide a detailed written statement of decision, which will be part of the arbitration award and admissible in any judicial proceeding to confirm, correct or vacate the award. Interpretations of these Terms, including determinations of unconscionability, will be determined by the arbitrator selected through this provision. The parties will initially share the cost of such arbitration, provided that the prevailing party will be entitled to all fees and costs associated with arbitration (or enforcement of an award therefrom), including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees, from the other party upon completion of the arbitration or subsequent enforcement action.

The parties acknowledge and agree that any action with respect to your infringement or alleged infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights, any action in which Company seeks equitable relief, or any other action that may not be submitted to arbitration under applicable law, including the enforcement of any arbitration ruling, shall be tried by a court of competent jurisdiction located in New Castle County, Delaware. In that respect, you hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the State of Delaware agree that its laws will be used to resolve all disputes arising from or concerning these Terms.

**22\. Class Action Waiver**

Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
