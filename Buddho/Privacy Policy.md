GDPR/AVG Proof

Our Privacy Policy
==================

![Privacy Policy](https://buddho.org/wp-content/uploads/privacy.jpg)

Here you will find the privacy policy of buddho.org website. We created this Privacy Policy to declare which information we collect, how we use data and which options the users of our website have, according to the guidelines of the [General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&%3Btid=%20111629722)

Unfortunately, these subjects sound rather technical due to their nature, but we have put much effort into describing the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.

Rights in Accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation
----------------------------------------------------------------

You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Dutch Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming (AVG):

* right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)
* right to erasure (“right to be forgotten“) (article 17 GDPR)
* right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)
* righ to notification – notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (article 19 GDPR)
* right to data portability (article 20 GDPR)
* Right to object (article 21 GDPR)
* right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing – including profiling – (article 22 GDPR)

If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority.

The following personal data will be processed when using the contact form:

1. Your first and/or last name

The Newsletter
--------------

Buddho.org uses Noptin to manage our newsletter from within the WordPress environment. This means that your data stays on our own server, without the intervention of a third party.

We will use the email address provided to send you a monthly update on new posts and occasionally to send you a additional messages or information relating to the meditation system, Buddhism, the meditation group and/or the foundation.

In the case of direct donations by bank transfer, we can see the standard details on our statements, which generally apply to bank transfers. For donations via Credit Card we use Mollie, see also their [privacy statement](https://www.mollie.com/nl/privacy).

For credit card payments the privacy statement of the credit card company applies, when paying with Paypal the [privacy statement](https://www.paypal.com/va/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) of Paypal applies.

Your name and email address will be stored for administrative purposes in our secured database. We can also see your name permanently on our statements.

We might use your email address to send a personal thank you note but will not do so more often then twice a year.

Speed & Security
----------------

Buddho.org takes data protection seriously and takes appropriate measures to prevent misuse, loss, unauthorized access, unwanted disclosure and unauthorized modification.

The website uses a reliable SSL Certificate and other security measures, at server, application and connection level, to ensure that your personal data does not fall into the wrong hands.

We use https to transfer information on the internet in a tap-proof manner (data protection through technology design [Article 25 Section 1 GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN&tid=111629722)). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.

You can recognize the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser’s top left corner, as well as by the use of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.

The IP address of visitors, user IDs of logged in users, and usernames of login attempts might be conditionally logged to monitor for malicious activity and protect the website from specific attacks. Examples of conditions under which data is stored include login attempts, logout attempts, requesting suspect URLs, making changes to site content, and password updates. This information is stored for 60 days.

### Cloudflare

We use Cloudflare by the company Cloudflare, Inc. (101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) on this website to enhance its speed and security. For this, Cloudflare uses cookies and processes user data. Cloudflare, Inc. is an American company that offers a content delivery network and various security services. These services take place between the user and our hosting provider. In the following, we will try to explain in detail what all this means.

#### What is Cloudflare?

A content delivery network (CDN), as provided by Cloudflare, is nothing more than a network of servers that are connected to each other. Cloudflare has deployed servers around the world, which ensure websites can appear on your screen faster. Simply put, Cloudflare makes copies of our website and places them on its own servers. Thus, when you visit our website, a load distribution system ensures that the main part of our website is delivered by a server that can display our website to you as quickly as possible. The CDN significantly shortens the route of the transmitted data to your browser. Thus, Cloudflare does not only deliver our website’s content from our hosting server, but from servers from all over the world. Cloudflare is particularly helpful for users from abroad, since pages can be delivered from a nearby server. In addition to the fast delivery of websites, Cloudflare also offers various security services, such as DDoS protection, or the web application firewall.

#### Why do we use Cloudflare on our website?

Of course, we want our website to offer you the best possible service. Cloudflare helps us make our website faster and more secure. Cloudflare offers us web optimisations as well as security services such as DDoS protection and a web firewall. Moreover, this includes a Reverse-Proxy and the content distribution network (CDN). Cloudflare blocks threats and limits abusive bots as well as crawlers that waste our bandwidth and server resources. By storing our website in local data center’s and blocking spam software, Cloudflare enables us to reduce our bandwidth usage by about 60%. Furthermore, the provision of content through a data centre near you and certain web optimizations carried out there, cut the average loading time of a website in about half. According to Cloudflare, the setting “I’m Under Attack Mode” can be used to mitigate further attacks by displaying a JavaScript calculation task that must be solved before a user can access a website. Overall, this makes our website significantly more powerful and less susceptible to spam or other attacks.

#### What data is stored by Cloudflare?

Cloudflare generally only transmits data that is controlled by website operators. Therefore, Cloudflare does not determine the content, but the website operator themselves does. Additionally, Cloudflare may collect certain information about the use of our website and may process data we send or data which Cloudflare has received certain instructions for. Mostly, Cloudflare receives data such as IP addresses, contacts and protocol information, security fingerprints and websites’ performance data. Log data for example helps Cloudflare identify new threats. That way, Cloudflare can ensure a high level of security for our website. As part of their services, Cloudflare process this data in compliance with the applicable laws. Of course, this also includes the compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Furthermore, Cloudflare uses a cookie for security reasons. The cookie is used to identify individual users behind a shared IP address, and to apply security settings for each individual user. The cookie is very useful, if you e.g. use our website from a restaurant where several infected computers are located. However, if your computer is trustworthy, we can recognise that with the cookie. Hence, you will be able to freely and carelessly surf our website, despite the infected PCs in your area. Another point that is important to know, is that this cookie does not store any personal data. The cookie is essential for Cloudflare’s security functions and cannot be deactivated.
