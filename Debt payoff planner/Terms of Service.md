-------------------------------------

We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.

We make no guarantee about the Service uptime and availability for any user, regardless of whether they are a paid subscriber or an unpaid subscriber or any other user.

We make no guarantee about the timeliness, accuracy, or delivery of any aspect of our services.  This includes but is not limited to payment reminders.

Subscriptions
-------------

Some parts of the Service may be billed on a one-time basis (“Subscription(s)”) for access to additional features for a fixed period of time (“one-time term”).  If you’ve subscribed to some parts of the service that are billed on a one-time basis, your payment will not be automatically renewed at the end of your one-time term.  At the end of the one-time term, the service will remove the additional features.  The continued availability of the additional features after the one-time term be decided in sole discretion of OxbowSoft LLC.

Some parts of the Service may be billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). If you’ve subscribed to some parts of the Service, you will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or OxbowSoft LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal by contacting OxbowSoft LLC customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide OxbowSoft LLC or its third party payment processor with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize OxbowSoft LLC or its third party payment processor to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, OxbowSoft LLC will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

Fee Changes
-----------

OxbowSoft LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

For automatically renewed subscriptions, OxbowSoft LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

Refunds
-------

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by OxbowSoft LLC on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of OxbowSoft LLC.

Partial refunds are issued at the sole discretion of OxbowSoft LLC.  In the event that a partial refund is provided, it will be in accordance with the amount that the user would have paid for the used duration of the subscription.  For example, if there are 2 pricing tiers: 2 months at a cost of $100 and 12 months at a cost of $300 and the user buys the 12 month subscription but is approved for a partial refund after only 1 month, they will receive a partial refund of $200.  The partial refund amount in this example is equivalent to had the user purchased the service originally for only 1 month, whereby the closest tier would be the 2 months at a cost of $100.
