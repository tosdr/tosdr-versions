**INFORMATION NOT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE**  
We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:

* We may collect information including, but not limited to, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where a product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.

* Our web servers automatically collect usage information when you visit the Site. Site usage information is information about our visitors (unregistered users) and users that describes how the Site is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors and users to each web page and the length of their stays. Site usage information also includes the domain names and/or corresponding IP addresses (a numerical identifier for a computer on the Internet) of those who visit the Site.

If we do combine non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

**SECURITY**  
The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We will maintain appropriate safeguards to protect the security, integrity, and privacy of these servers and of your personally identifiable information. This includes encryption to protect credit and debit card numbers. Except as described herein, we will not use or intentionally disclose any personally identifiable information about you to any unaffiliated third parties without your consent.

**HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED**  
We may combine the personally identifiable information we collect from you when you use the Site with other information about you that is available to us, including survey information. We may use such information in several ways, including:

* To enable us to process and verify purchases, to provide you with the goods and services you have requested, and for the purposes disclosed when you provide the personally identifiable information.

**COOKIES**  
The Site, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies to help visitors and users move faster throughout the Site. When a visitor or user accesses the Site and takes advantage of certain features, we place several cookies on that user’s computer. A cookie is a string of information sent by a Site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer’s memory. This allows the Site to recognize you as you move through the Site. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

**REVIEW AND CORRECTION**  
You may review and update the personal information you provide us with as part of the registration process by accessing your profile after you login to the Site.

**SHARING INFORMATION**  
MyPropertyIDRegistry.com does not sell, rent, or otherwise provide personal information you provide through the Site or otherwise to outside marketers without prior consent, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.

It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for MyPropertyIDRegistry.com to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
