Bausch Health Companies Inc. (“Bausch Health,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) operates this website (the “Site”) and may operate other websites, mobile or desktop applications, and/or additional online services (together with the Site, the “Services”) for your personal information and education. The terms and conditions set forth in this Legal Notice (the “Terms”), together with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.bauschhealth.com/privacy-policy/) comprise a legal agreement between you and Bausch Health and govern your access to and use of the Services, including any Content (as defined in Section 7 below) appearing on or provided through the Services. Please read these Terms carefully.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT SECTION 20 OF THESE TERMS CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. TO THE FULLEST LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE EXTENT, THESE TERMS AFFECT THE RIGHTS YOU HAVE IN ANY DISPUTE WITH US AND OUR AFFILIATES AND HOW ANY SUCH DISPUTE MAY BE RESOLVED.**

**1\. Not Providing Medical Advice**

We are not engaged in medical or similar professional services or advice via the Site or the Services, and the information provided hereon and therein is not a substitute for the professional judgment of a qualified health care professional. You should consult a physician or other health care professional for advice regarding any medical condition or treatment thereof. The Services and any information or Content provided in connection therewith are for informational and educational purposes only. Your reliance upon any Content or information provided through the Site or the Services is solely at your own risk.

**2\. Void Where Prohibited**

This Site is located in the United States (“U.S.”) and is designed to comply with the laws, rules, and regulations of the U.S. Although accessible from other countries, the Services and Content are intended for access and use by U.S. residents only, and Bausch Health makes no representation, warranty, or other guaranty that the Services or the Content are appropriate for use in any other jurisdiction. For example, the Site contains information regarding products and services that may or may not be available in any particular country or region, may be available under different brands, trademarks, or service marks in different countries, may not be approved by a regulatory authority for marketing, sale, or use in certain countries, and/or may be approved for different indications or with different restrictions in different jurisdictions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Site does link to other websites owned and operated by Bausch Health’s affiliates and operating divisions which may be located outside of the U.S. Those websites may have information that is not appropriate for users in the U.S. In no event shall the information on any of those websites be construed as a promotion or solicitation for the use of any product or service that is not authorized under the laws, rules, and regulations of the country where you are located. Any offer for any product or service made on this Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to access the Services or any Content from other locations, you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you are responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws, rules, and regulations.

**3\. Amendment of Terms**

Bausch Health reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in its sole and absolute discretion without advance notice to you. Such modifications shall be effective immediately upon being posted in relation to any of the Services or Content. Continuing to access and/or use the Services or Content after we post modifications to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of such modifications.

**4\. Modification of the Site**

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site, any part of the Site, or any Services, for any or no reason and without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any Services. For example, we may change the information and materials on the Site from time to time at our sole discretion, and we may restrict access to some or all of the Services to both guests and users.

**5\. Restrictions on Access and Use**

You may not access or use, or attempt to access or use, the Services or Content to take any action that could harm Bausch Health or any third party or interfere with the operation of the Services or Content, nor may you use the Services or Content in a manner that violates any applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree not to:

* Impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity or the origin of any information you provide;
* Use any device, software, or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper functioning of any Service or any activity conducted on any Service or attempt to probe, scan, test the vulnerability of, or breach the security of any system or network;

* Engage in unauthorized spidering, scraping, or harvesting of content or information, or use any other unauthorized automated means to compile information;
* Obtain or attempt to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems, materials, information, or any services available on or through the Services or Content;

* Engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits any person from using or enjoying the Services or the Content, or that, in our sole and absolute judgment, exposes us or any of our users, affiliates, or any other third party to any liability, damages, or harm of any type.

Violations of system or network security and certain other conduct may result in civil or criminal liability to you. We may investigate and work with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate these Terms.

You may be asked to register for certain activities in connection with the Services by creating a user profile. When you so register, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself and to promptly update this information to maintain its accuracy.

Third-party intellectual property appearing on or through the Services or Content belongs to the respective owner.

**8\. Non-Endorsement, Discretion to Post, and Limited Rights Regarding User-Posted Content**

Information and postings on forums, comment areas, blogs, or other interactive features may be provided by persons acting on our behalf, as well as unrelated third parties. Users of these Services are not otherwise connected with us and may use anonymous screen names. Neither Bausch Health nor any of its affiliates are responsible for the content of any communication submitted or posted by users to any features publicly viewable on the Services, such as blogs, message boards, or other interactive content, nor do we guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or validity of any posted communication. Any action you take or do not take based upon information posted to any of the Services’ interactive features, including but not limited to medical, investment, trading, employment, or other decisions, is done at your own risk.

From time to time on certain areas of the Services you may be able to submit written posts and certain other materials (collectively, “User Content”). By using these features, you agree that you will not post any content that is unlawful, harmful, tortious, defamatory, libelous, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist, infringing, pornographic, violent, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate as determined by Bausch Health in its sole and absolute discretion; that you will not post any content that contains personal information about any individual, violates the privacy/publicity of any other individual or entity, or breaches any confidentiality or other contractual obligation to which you are bound; that you will not impersonate any person or organization, including without limitation, the personnel of Bausch Health (or its affiliates, representatives, or agents) or misrepresent an affiliation with another person or organization; and that you will not post any content that contains viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may adversely affect the operation or features of the Services.

Neither Bausch Health, nor any of its affiliates, assumes any liability for any information removed from the Services, and reserves the right to permanently restrict access to the Services or any user account.

By submitting communications or content to or through any part of the Services, you agree that such submission is non-confidential for all purposes and that any inclusion of personally identifiable information, such as your name, photograph, or other information in such posts may allow others to identify you.

We reserve the right (but assume no obligation) to monitor any submissions or postings and delete, move, or edit any content that we consider inappropriate or unacceptable for any reason. Where we do moderate interactive features such as blogs, we may review comments and postings for relevance, topicality, and appropriateness, and we may withhold or remove postings for any reason, in our sole and absolute discretion.

This license includes the right to host, index, cache, distribute, and tag any User Content, as well as the right to sublicense User Content to third parties, including other users, for use on other media or platforms known or hereinafter developed.

**13\. Links to Third Party Sites**

This Site and any Services may provide links to other websites on the Internet that are operated and maintained by third parties. These websites operate independently from Bausch Health and are not under our control or responsibility. In addition, you may be required to download certain programs, products, or services from such third parties, including without limitation in order to access coupons to certain Bausch Health products or services. The existence of such links to other websites does not constitute an endorsement by Bausch Health of those other websites, the content displayed therein, the programs, products, or services described thereon, or the persons or entities associated therewith. When you visit any such third-party websites, you will exit our Site and not be using the Services, and Bausch Health accepts no responsibility or liability with respect to any such website or any other website that is not under its control. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of those third-party websites or services. You accept sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites.

**14\. Copyright Infringement**

If you are a copyright owner or a copyright owner’s agent and you believe any content submitted to and/or appearing on or through a Site or the Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a notification by following the rules of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), which requires that you notify our designated copyright agent with the following information in writing:

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that you claim is infringed;
* A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
* A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service;
* The address, telephone number, and/or electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
* A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the DMCA. Accordingly, you understand that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of the DMCA listed above, your notice may not be valid.

To report trademark and/or copyright claimed infringement, send notifications and counter-notifications via U.S. mail at: **Bausch Health, Trademark/Legal Department, 400 Somerset Corporate Blvd., Bridgewater, NJ 08807,** or by electronic mail at **[TrademarkRequest@bauschhealth.com](mailto:TrademarkRequest@bauschhealth.com)**. This contact information is only for reporting alleged copyright infringement claims. Contact information for other matters is provided in Section 21 below.

**15\. Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Bausch Health and its affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, service providers, agents, representatives, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all demands, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, losses, costs, expenses and harms, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses (including any of the foregoing incurred in enforcement of this indemnity), related to or associated with your use of the Services and/or Content, online conduct, any violation of these Terms, or dealings or transactions with other persons resulting from use of the Services or Content.

**16\. Supplemental Policies or Terms and Conditions**

In connection with your access to and/or use of the Services or Content, you may be asked to consent to policies or terms and conditions in addition to these Terms. Please read these supplemental policies or terms and conditions carefully before accessing or making any use of such portions of the Services or Content. Any supplemental policies or terms and conditions will not vary or replace any of these Terms unless otherwise expressly stated.

**17\. Termination**

Bausch Health reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to and use of the Services or Content, with or without prior notice.

**18\. Integration; Enforceability; No Waiver**

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Bausch Health with respect to their subject matter, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous communications and agreements (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and us with respect to such subject matter. In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, such unenforceability will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms or respond to a breach by you or any other party shall not in any way waive our right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of these Terms or to act with respect to similar breaches.

**19\. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution**

These Terms and your access to and use of the Services and Content are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions, and by the laws of the United States. By accessing and/or using the Services or Content, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of any other jurisdiction.

THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD SHALL BE BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. YOU AGREE THAT BAUSCH HEALTH MAY SEEK ANY INTERIM OR PRELIMINARY RELIEF FROM A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK NECESSARY TO PROTECT ITS RIGHTS OR PROPERTY PENDING THE COMPLETION OF ARBITRATION.

THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED. YOU AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (1) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH THE SERVICES, THESE TERMS, AND/OR THE PRIVACY POLICY WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION; (2) ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS, AND AWARDS OF COSTS WILL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL THIRD PARTY, OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS INCURRED (IF ANY), BUT IN NO EVENT WILL ATTORNEYS’ FEES BE AWARDED OR RECOVERABLE; (3) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL YOU BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN ANY AWARD FOR, AND YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO SEEK, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, AND/OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, AND/OR ANY RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED; AND (4) YOUR REMEDIES BEYOND THOSE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN ARE LIMITED TO A CLAIM FOR MONEY DAMAGES (IF ANY) AND YOU IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR EQUITABLE RELIEF. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS TO OR EXCLUSIONS OF CERTAIN FORMS OF LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD SHALL BE BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. YOU AGREE THAT BAUSCH HEALTH MAY SEEK ANY INTERIM OR PRELIMINARY RELIEF FROM A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA NECESSARY TO PROTECT ITS RIGHTS OR PROPERTY PENDING THE COMPLETION OF ARBITRATION.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH TIME LIMITATION IS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU MUST FILE ANY CLAIM OR INITIATE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, THESE TERMS, OR THE PRIVACY POLICY WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR DISPUTE COULD BE FILED OR INITIATED, OR IT SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.

**20\. Forward Looking Statements**

The Site may contain forward-looking statements regarding Bausch Health’s financial and operating performance, business plans, prospects, and related strategic initiatives, in-line products, and products in development, all of which involve substantial risks and uncertainties, financial and otherwise. Actual results could differ materially from the expectations and projections set forth in any of these statements. Such risks and uncertainties may include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve drug applications and supplemental drug applications as well as their decisions regarding labeling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of Bausch Health’s products; competitive developments; the ability to successfully market both new and existing products; challenges to the validity and enforcement of Bausch Health’s patents; trends toward managed care and health care cost containment; governmental laws and regulations affecting health care, including without limitation regarding pharmaceutical product access, pricing and reimbursement; and general economic conditions, such as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A further list and description of these and other risks, uncertainties, and other matters can be found in Bausch Health’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, all of which are available on this Site and at [www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/).
