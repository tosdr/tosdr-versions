**SITE FUNCTIONALITY**
----------------------

**Cookies**. We may use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies to automatically collect certain information about you. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties. You should be able to decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your Internet browser settings. However, if you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain services or features on the Site or in connection with the Services. Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as "web beacons" or "clear GIFs," that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device. By accessing the Site or using any Services, you affirmatively consent to our use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar tracking technologies. You may change your preferences in this respect by emailing us at [u.s.privacy@bausch.com](mailto:u.s.privacy@bausch.com).

We may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information through the Site and Services. We do not control how those third parties use that information. These third parties include service providers who may use these technologies to collect information that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics. For example, the Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses cookies and other tracking technology to collect aggregate data ("Aggregate Data") from your visits to the Site. To learn more about the privacy policy of [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en), refer to Google's Policies.

We store any Aggregate Data collected from you in aggregate form. We are not able to—nor will we attempt to—identify any particular user or individual from the Aggregate Data. We use the Aggregate Data in a variety of ways, including but not limited to keeping count of a user’s return visits to the Site, accumulating and reporting aggregate statistical information regarding the Site, and determining which features users prefer.

Different methods exist for you to prevent tracking of your online activity, including setting "do not track" preferences in your browser to alert websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. Please note that, at this time, this Site does not recognize such "do not track" instructions. We will update this Privacy Policy if we recognize "do not track" instructions in the future. If you have any questions regarding the use of cookies on our sites, or wish to change or revoke your consent to the use of cookies, please contact us using one of the methods set out in the "Contact Us" section at the end of this Privacy Policy.
