Terms of Use
============

All content created and obtained via this website is subject to the following Terms of Use.

In simple language, each purchase grants the buyer a license to sell, redistribute, modify, publish, or sublicense the purchased content, but this content may not be used to create a competing service with Hotpot.ai products or services. Additional limitations may apply for AI content and services or if the purchased content contains content from third-parties. For example, designers may resell content to clients, and those clients and their affiliates may resell the content, provided this content does not compete with Hotpot.ai.

Please read these Terms of Use carefully because they affect your legal rights and include an agreement to resolve disputes that may arise between us. We believe these rules simplify and enhance the service for all users.

Read below for details.

The Company may modify the Terms at any time. We strongly urge Users to review the Terms on a regular basis and certainly before using the Services.

Intellectual Property
---------------------

All intellectual property rights over this website, the Services, its design, and source code, and all content included in any of them (including without limitation text, images, animations, databases, graphics, logos, trademarks, icons, buttons, pictures, videos, sound recordings, etc.) belong to or are licensed to the Company.

Any lines of code, machine learning models, or other software offered by the Company as part of the Services is secured by copyright. You may not copy, distribute, transfer, or modify any software, any content, or any part of the Services without prior express written consent from the Company.

Under this license Users may not: attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software or any aspects of the Services; remove any copyright or other proprietary notations; or transfer the content to another person without permission or mirror any part of the Services. This license shall automatically terminate if Users violate these restrictions and may be terminated by the Company at any time. Upon termination of this license, Users must destroy any content in their possession whether in electronic or printed format.

In particular, Users are strictly prohibited from using the Services to train, improve, enhance, or otherwise develop competing AI models and services, including open-sourced and closed-sourced alternatives, without explicit written permission from the Company.

Registration
------------

In order to use certain Services, the User must register, creating a username and password and activating an account. To this end, the User must provide a valid email address where the User will receive notifications related to the Services. If the User is a legal entity or business, its username must be its full name or corporate name and the person registering on behalf of the legal entity or business declares that he/she is duly authorized to bind such legal entity or business and that such legal entity or business shall be bound to these Terms. The User agrees to provide the mandatory information required for registration and also acknowledges that such information is true, complete and up to date. The User is solely responsible for keeping such information updated. Should the User provide false, outdated or incomplete information, or should the Company have reasons to suspect it, the Company reserves the right to suspend or cancel the User’s account. The User must protect and keep the account password confidential and must not disclose it to third-parties. The User must neither allow other Users to access the Services through the User’s account nor use the account of another User to access the Services. Allowing other people to use your account creates a security risk, and you bear full responsibility and all liability stemming from such actions. The User is responsible for all operations carried out through the User’s account through any device. If the User suspects that another User is using his account, he/she/it should immediately inform the Company. The Company may suspend or cancel the User’s account if it considers that the User has breached these Terms.

Liability
---------

The User acknowledges and agrees to use this website and its Services at the User’s own risk and under the User’s responsibility and, therefore, the Company does not accept any responsibility for misuse or use in breach of these Terms.

The User will be responsible for any damages to the Company resulting from the User’s use of this website and the Services in breach of the Terms and accepts to indemnify the Company and its directors, employees, agents and representatives from any liability in which they may incur as a result of the User’s usage of the Services. In particular, Users accept defend, indemnify, and hold safe the Company, its affiliates, and their corresponding officers, directors, agents and workers, from and against any claims, actions or demands, including without limitation affordable legal, accounting, and other provider charges, affirming or resulting from usage of the Services.

The Company does not warrant the availability or continuity of this website or the Services, neither its reliability, quality, completeness, accuracy or whether they are fit for a specific purpose or activity.

As way of example and without limitation, the Company shall not be liable for damages that may result from: interruptions, viruses, technical problems, interferences, omissions, unavailability, power cuts, failure of the telecommunication networks or the User’s equipment; delays or unavailability of the Services due to deficiencies or traffic overload on the Internet, in the communication network, or the electricity grid. Nor shall the Company be liable for damages resulting from third-party actions, software updates, or other causes. Put simply: USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT THE SOLE RISK OF THE USER, AND THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE USER AS A RESULT OF USING THE SERVICES.

The insertion of links in the Services does not imply any relationship, recommendation or supervision by the Company of the linked website and, accordingly, the Company does not accept any liability in relation to the content of any linked website except in the specific circumstances provided by the applicable law.

The Company will make reasonable commercial efforts in order to ensure the accuracy of keywords and descriptions, as well as the identification of content as exclusively for editorial use or any equivalent expression. However, THE COMPANY NEITHER WARRANTS NOR MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION REGARDING ANY KEYWORD, TITLE OR DESCRIPTION; OR THE IDENTIFICATION OR LACK OF IDENTIFICATION OF ANY VISUAL CONTENT AS EXCLUSIVELY FOR EDITORIAL USE. For this reason and notwithstanding any other liability limitation that may be applicable in accordance with these Terms, the Company shall neither indemnify nor assume any liability in connection with any claim resulting from inaccurate keywords, titles or descriptions, or from the use of the visual content identified as exclusively for editorial use.

Disclaimer
----------

The Company may provide Services and content with technical, typographical, or photographic errors. The Company does not warrant that the Services or provided content are accurate, complete, or current. The Company may make changes to the Services and associated content at any time without notice. The Company also does not make any commitment to update the Services at regular intervals.

In particular, the Company may inadvertently publish erroneous pricing. In cases of dispute, incorrect prices may not be honored, and this decision is solely at the discretion of The Company. The Company will endeavor to notify Users as soon as possible upon incorrect pricing and will provide a refund, less the amount of consumed services, upon request for any User who bought services with incorrect pricing.

The Services are provided "as is." The Company makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, the Company does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, uniqueness, likely results, or reliability of the Services and associated content.

To reiterate, the Company cannot warrant uniqueness of output, nor non-infringement of intellectual property, nor other violation of rights. As with other software tools, the User bears sole and full responsibility for non-infringment of intellectual property laws and compliance with all applicable laws.

Subscription Payments
---------------------

To provide flexibility, we offer one-time credits and subscription credits. We charge less for subscription credits in exchange for more commitment. For users who value flexibility most, we recommend one-time credits. Subscription users are required to pay for at least two terms. Otherwise, one-term subscriptions undermine the integrity of the billing system and hurt one-time users.

AI Services
-----------

Refunds for AI services differ from refunds for the graphic platform. AI services are not refundable. If unhappy with AI services, Users should contact the Company about exploring an alternative outcome that accommodates everyone. The Company will offer its best effort to find a mutually agreeable solution, but this is not guaranteed.

Responsible AI Usage
--------------------

Users are only authorized to use the Services for lawful purposes and in accordance with The Company's license, terms, and conditions.

Any general purpose technology contains the potential for abuse. The Company explicitly prohibits and condemns illegal or abusive practices with the intent to harm others. Such conduct may result in account suspension or termination, without recourse of refunds.

Specifically, the Company forbids certain uses, including, but not limited to, the cases below. By using the Services, users unconditionally consent to these restrictions. If uncertain about the legality of an usage, Users are required to seek authorized written permission from the Company before using the Services. Failure to seek authorized written permission may result in account suspension or termination, without recourse of refunds.

Legal Compliance And Output Uniqueness
--------------------------------------

The Services cannot guarantee uniquess of art, graphics, images, text, copywriting, or other generated output.

Because multiple users may share similar ideas, it is possible some users may use the Services and create similar or even identical output. It is also possible for another company to replicate the software and also generate similar or identical outputs. The Company therefore does not warrant and does not guarantee uniquess. The User bears sole and full responsibility for compliance with all applicable intellectual property laws, particularly in cases where the User uses the Services for commercial purposes.

More broadly, the User bears sole and full responsibility for complying with all applicable laws and for using the Services in a responsible, reasonable manner.

Redistributed Licenses
----------------------

The Services are built on software that require redistribution of licenses. [See here](https://hotpot.ai/terms/licenses) for the list.

Contact

Please contact the Company with any questions or comments via email. Any feedback or comment you provide shall be deemed non-confidential unless you explicitly state otherwise.
