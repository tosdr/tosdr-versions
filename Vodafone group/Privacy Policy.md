Welcome to Vodafone’s Privacy and Cookie Statement

### Privacy statement

**Last updated: 18 March 2024**

In the following privacy policy "we/us" means Vodafone Group Plc; "third party" means someone who is not you or us; and "Vodafone Group" means Vodafone Group Plc and any company or other organisation in which Vodafone Group Plc owns more than 15% of the share capital.

Our registered office is Vodafone House, The Connection Newbury, Berkshire RG14 2FN. We are registered in England under company number 1833679. Vodafone Group Plc is registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), registration number Z8088474.

Changes to our Privacy Policy:

This Privacy Policy gets updated from time to time; whenever we make a change, we’ll post this on our website and ask you to review your privacy settings next time you come to visit vodafone.com

### Privacy policy

Personal information we collect about you

##### Information we collect about you

The types of information we collect about you when you visit and interact with this site are:

* Your contact details such as name and email address where you have contacted us through this site; or
* If you have agreed to cookies, data such as your site preferences or language settings. We can also use this information in an aggregate manner to understand how our visitors navigate this site so we can make it better.

##### When we collect your personal information

We collect your personal information when you:

* Browse and interact with the vodafone.com website; or
* Use our contact forms to get in touch or register your interest.

##### Vodafone will process your personal data based on:

1. Our legitimate business interests, for example, direct marketing and improvement of our services. Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our business interests to make sure they do not override your rights. Additionally, in some cases you have the right to object to this processing. For more information, visit the Your Rights section of this policy.
2. Consent you provide where Vodafone does not rely on another legal basis. Consent will always be presented separately to you, can be withdrawn at any time and you will be given details on how to change your mind.

How we use your personal information

##### Maintaining this website and providing you with any services requested through it

For example, when you contact us through this site, we’ll use your information to ensure you get the right information and response.

##### To personalise this website and track its performance

Because of the way this website operates, we may also use information from your browser or browsing activities to personalize the site or route you to relevant information. For example, we may use web-log information, cookies or web beacons in ways that help us maintain some of your site preferences, send you to the right country-specific information or understand how our visitors navigate the site so we can make it better.  
  
You can choose whether or not to allow cookies or web beacons using your browser preferences. To find out more about cookies and your choices, visit the Cookies section of this statement.

How we share your personal information

Some of the services or information you can request on this site may come from other members of our corporate family. Therefore, we may share your information with other companies within Vodafone Group (for example, your local carrier). The laws of the countries where these companies are based may not be the same as those in the EU, but your information will be treated with the same high standard of care wherever it’s processed within the corporate family.

International data transfer

We may need to transfer your information to other Vodafone Group companies (for example, if the information you request is delivered by them) or service providers in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA consists of countries in the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway: they are considered to have equivalent laws when it comes to data protection and privacy. This kind of data transfer may happen if our servers (i.e. where we store data) or our suppliers and service providers are based outside the EEA, or if you use our services and products while visiting countries outside this area.  
  
If Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we will make sure that your information is properly protected. We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer. In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will implement additional technical security and organisational safeguards such as asking the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.

How long we keep your information for

We’ll store your information for as long as we have to by law. If there’s no legal requirement for us to retain the data, we’ll only store it for as long as we need to.

Keeping your personal information secure

We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.  
Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren’t secure unless they’ve been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.

  
We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.  
We’ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication. You’re responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.

  
Our website may provide links to third-party websites. We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites. So make sure you read that company’s privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site.

  
The same applies to any third-party websites or content you connect to using our products and services.  
You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.

  
Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies. You should make sure you’re familiar with these.

Your rights

Under the law, you have a number of rights that you can exercise free of charge. We have included a summary of these below; if you would like to discuss or exercise any of these, please contact us through the details provided.

##### Right to correct personal data

If you believe any of the personal data we hold about you is incorrect, you can request we update it.

##### Right to object to use of personal data

In some circumstances, you can request that we temporarily suspend the processing of your data.

##### Right to erasure

In some circumstances, such as where we no longer have a justifiable reason to continue to process your data, you can request we delete it.

##### Right to restrict use of your data

If you feel data we hold on you is inaccurate or believe we shouldn’t be processing your data, please contact our Customer Services team to discuss your rights. In certain circumstances you will have the right to ask us to restrict processing.

##### How to lodge a complaint

If you have a complaint, you can contact us on the details provided. We’ll do our best to help but if you’re still unhappy, you can contact the ICO, which is the UK data protection regulator – their details are at [**www.ico.org.uk**](http://www.ico.org.uk./).

In this cookie policy we explain what cookies are, how we use them and how you can manage them for both our site and other websites you might use.

What are cookies

Cookies usually comprise of unique alphanumeric identifier that sits on your browser. In some cases, we won’t be able to link the information we collect by using a cookie back to you. They can, however, enable us to link that information back to you and your personal information, for example, when you log in, or choose to register for a service, or newsletter. We may also use cookies in order to provide you with personalised adverts based on your browsing behaviour.

Our cookies don't hold personal information such as your name. They simply let us find information once you're logged in or help link your browsing information to you and your personal information when you choose to register for a service, white paper or newsletter.  
  
To do this we sometimes use persistent cookies. We take looking after your personal information seriously – we're always monitoring and improving how we protect it.

1. Strictly necessary – these are used to help make our website work efficiently and enable you to use our services and cannot be switched off.
2. Performance – these are used to analyse the way our website works and how we can improve it for example which pages you visit the most often and if you get any error messages from web pages;
3. Functionality – these help to enhance your experience by doing things like remembering choices you make and provide a more enhanced, personal features; and
4. Targeting/advertising – these are used to share some information with third parties who we advertise with, so we know how you've reached our website. We can also use cookies to identify the parts of the website you are interested in. We then use this information to show you adverts and pages we think may also be of interest to you, to tailor how we communicate with you, or to tailor the contents of the communications we send to you. If you prefer, you can opt out of these. Tailoring of content means it includes information reflecting the interest you’ve shown in the content of our web pages, or offers or promotions that we think may interest you, and to improve how we respond to your needs.
5. Persistent Cookies - We sometimes use persistent cookies as well as 'session-based' cookies. A 'persistent' cookie will remain for a period of time set for that cookie. A 'session-based' cookie is allocated only for the duration of your visit to our website and automatically expires when you close down your browser. **Please also note that some cookies may be set by your browser, for example when you browse using Google Chrome. We don’t control the use of browser cookies, so we suggest you check the browser’s cookie policy to understand how those are used and how you can manage them.**

Third party cookies

Third party cookies originate from a domain that’s different to the website being visited. For example, when you visit our website, we may link to another company's website – like our Facebook or Twitter account, or a video from our YouTube page.

So, when you 'Like' or 'Tweet' an item from our website, these sites may sometimes put cookies on your computer. We don't control how they use their cookies, so we suggest you check their website to see how they're using them and how you can manage them.

Affiliates of the Vodafone Group with a different domain name may also place cookies on our website, to show you adverts or pages of other Vodafone Group companies that may be of interest to you. Details of these affiliates – and how to opt-out – are included in the table.

Third parties that may put cookies on our website are
