Universal Terms of Service
==========================

_Last Updated: July 25, 2024_

**IMPORTANT:**

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY FORM AN AGREEMENT AND IMPACT A VISITOR, USER AND/OR CUSTOMER’S LEGAL RIGHTS.** 

These UNIVERSAL TERMS OF SERVICE are an agreement which sets forth the terms and conditions (collectively, the “UToS”) governing the use of the products, services, website ([www.inmotionhosting.com](http://www.inmotionhosting.com/)) and/or mobile-optimized versions of the website to which the UToS are linked (collectively, the “Website”), all of which are owned or operated by InMotion Hosting, Inc., its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and/or brands (collectively, “Company”), by a Website visitor, user and/or the party set forth in the related Company order form (“Customer”), which is incorporated herein by this reference (together with any subsequent order forms submitted by Customer to Company, collectively, the “Order”) and applies to Customer’s use and/or purchase(s) of any products, software, applications or other electronic or web-based services ordered by Customer on the Order (each a “Product” and collectively, the “Products”). The term “Website” also includes and is not limited to any subdomains of the Website and any content, code, data, services, products, features or functionality made available from or through the Website. Company reserves the right to and may change the UToS from time to time, at any time without notice to a visitor, user or Customer, by posting such changes on the Website. By accessing and/or using the Website or Products, Customer signifies that Customer has read, understands, acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the UToS, along with the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy-and-content/) (“AUP”), [Privacy Policy](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/privacy/), and [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/privacy/dpa/) (“DPA”), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. **SIGNING UP FOR THE PRODUCTS (THROUGH AN ORDER) OR USING THE WEBSITES AND/OR PRODUCTS CREATES A CONTRACT BETWEEN A VISITOR, USER OR CUSTOMER AND COMPANY AND EACH HEREBY ASSENTS, ACCEPTS AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE UTOS AND AGREEMENTS (AS DEFINED HEREIN). PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. IF A VISITOR, USER OR CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO THE UTOS AND AGREEMENTS, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITES OR PRODUCTS.**

1. Modification to the Products, Website and/or Agreements.
    1. Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time, change or modify the UToS, any Product, Product related terms and conditions (“Product Terms”), [AUP](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy-and-content/?customize_changeset_uuid=f4400f92-da43-430f-9e89-013bb1fb9b54&customize_messenger_channel=preview-0) and [Privacy Policy](https://inmotionhosting.com/privacy), all of which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to the Website.
    2. The UToS, Product Terms, AUP and Privacy Policy may collectively be referred to as the “Agreements.” Unless otherwise stated, capitalized terms shall have meanings set forth in the UToS, AUP or Privacy Policy and in the event of a conflict between the provisions of the UToS and the terms in any Product Terms, AUP or Privacy Policy, the provisions of the UToS shall control.
    3. BY USING A PRODUCT(S) AND/OR THE WEBSITE(S), EACH VISITOR, USER AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTS AND AGREES TO ABIDE BY THE AGREEMENTS AND REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT EACH HAS THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY AND CAPACITY TO ENTER INTO THE AGREEMENTS INDIVIDUALLY OR ON THEIR BEHALF THE ENTITY THEY MAY REPRESENT, AS THE CASE MAY BE. IF A VISITOR, USER OR CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO THE AGREEMENTS THEN THEY SHOULD NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE A PRODUCT OR THE WEBSITES.
    4. A visitor, user or Customer’s access to and/or use of a Product or the Website after changes or modifications to the Agreements have been made shall constitute such party’s acceptance of the Agreements as of the “Last Updated” date stated above.
    5. Company may (but is not obligated to) notify Customer of changes or modifications to the Agreements by electronic mail or other methods. It is therefore important that Customer keep Customer’s Company account via Company’s account management panel (“AMP”) (“Customer Account”) information accurate and current. Company assumes no liability or responsibility for Customer’s failure to receive an electronic mail or other notification if such failure results from inaccurate Account information.
    6. Company may terminate, as determined in Company’s sole and absolute discretion, Customer’s access to a Customer Account or the Products for any violation or threatened violation or breach by Customer of any terms of the Agreements.
    7. COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, CHANGE, OR DISCONTINUE ANY ASPECT OF THE PRODUCTS WEBSITES OR AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PRICING AND/OR FEES, AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. Company reserves the right to cease offering or providing any of the Products or individual features, functionalities, or aspects of the Products at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice. Although Company makes great effort to maximize the lifespan of all Products and features, functionalities, or aspects of the Products, there are times when a Products or specific feature, functionality, or aspect of a Products offered will be discontinued or reach its end-of-life (“EOL”). In either case, those Products, or the specific feature, functionality, or aspect of that Product, will no longer be supported by Company, in any way, effective on the EOL date. In the event that any Product offered reaches or will reach EOL, Company will attempt to notify Customer in advance of the EOL date. It is Customer’s responsibility to take all necessary steps to replace the Product by migrating to a new Product before the EOL date (if available), or by entirely ceasing reliance on such Product before the EOL date. In either case, Company will either offer a comparable Product (if possible) to migrate to for the remainder of the Term (as defined herein), a prorated credit, or a prorated refund, to be determined by Company in its sole and absolute discretion. Company may, with or without notice to Customer, migrate Customer to the most up-to-date version of the Product, if available. Customer agrees to take full responsibility for any and all loss or damage arising from any such migration. However, if the Product maintains a reasonably equivalent functionality without such feature, functionality, or aspect, as determined by Company in its sole and absolute discretion, Company will not be required to offer a comparable feature or functionality for the Product or a refund. Company will not be liable to Customer or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any Product or individual features, functionalities, or aspects of a Product offered, provided or facilitated access to.
2. Ownership. All content included on the Website and within the Products are and shall continue to be the property of Company or its content suppliers and is protected under applicable copyright, patent, trademark, and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Any copying, redistribution, use or publication by a visitor, user or Customer of any such content or any part of the Website or Products is prohibited, except as expressly permitted in the Agreements. Under no circumstances will a visitor, user or Customer acquire any ownership rights or other interest in any content by or through use of the Website or Products.
3. Intended Audience. The Website and Products are intended for adults only. The Website and Products are not intended for any individual under the age of eighteen (18).
4. Authority To Contract.
    1. The Products are available only to individuals or entities who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. By signing up for and/or using the Products, Customer represents and warrants that Customer (or an entity’s representative) is at least eighteen (18) years of age; otherwise recognized as being able to form legally binding contracts under applicable law; and/or is not a person barred from purchasing or receiving the Products under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction.
    2. If Customer enters into the Agreements as a representative or on behalf of a legal entity or third party that retains or may retain ownership in a Customer Account, then Customer hereby represents and warrants that Customer has the legal authority to bind such legal entity or third party to the terms and conditions contained in the Agreements, in which case the term “Customer” shall refer to such entity or third party. If, after Customer’s electronic or other acceptance of the Agreements, Company finds that Customer does not have the legal authority to bind such entity or third party, Customer will be personally responsible for the obligations contained in the Agreements, including, but not limited to, any payment obligations. Company shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from Company’s reliance on any representation, instruction, notice, document or communication reasonably believed by Company to be genuine and originating from an authorized representative of Customer’s entity or third party. If there is reasonable doubt about the authenticity of any such instruction, notice, document or communication, Company reserves the right (but undertakes no duty) to require additional authentication from Customer. Company further reserves the right to suspend, cancel or terminate a Customer Account in the event of a dispute of ownership of a Customer Account or Customer Content (as defined herein) between the claimed owner and a representative acting on behalf of an entity.
    3. “Customer Content” is defined as content that is submitted to, stored on or distributed or disseminated by Customer via the Products and also includes (but is not limited to) content of Customer’s website(s), customer(s) and/or user(s). Customer further agrees to be bound by the terms of the Agreements for all transactions entered into by Customer, anyone acting as Customer’s agent and anyone who accesses or uses the Customer Account or the Products, whether or not authorized by Customer.
    4. A visitor, user and/or Customer acknowledges and agrees that any submissions (i.e., telephone, email, direct messaging/chat, etc.) to Company are entirely voluntary, do not establish a confidential relationship or obligate Company to treat such submission as confidential or secret, that Company has no obligation, either express or implied, to develop or use any submission, and no compensation is due for any intentional or unintentional use of any submissions, and that Company may be working on the same or similar content, it may already know of such content from other sources, it may wish to develop this (or similar) content on its own, or it may have taken or will take some other action. A visitor, user and/or Customer acknowledge and agree that Company may retain such submissions to collect information to enhance a visitor user and/or Customer experience.
5. Customer’s Account.
    1. In order to access some of the features of the Website or use some of the Products, Customer must create a Customer Account. Customer represents and warrants to Company that all information Customer submits when Customer creates a Customer Account is accurate, current and complete, and that Customer will keep the Customer Account information accurate, current and complete. If Company has reason to believe that the Customer Account information is untrue, inaccurate, out-of-date or incomplete, Company reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend, cancel or terminate the Customer Account. Customer is solely responsible for the activity that occurs on the Customer Account, whether authorized by Customer or not, and Customer must keep the Customer Account information secure, including without limitation all Customer number or login, password and payment method(s). For security purposes, Company strongly recommends that Customer change Customer’s password periodically for any Account.
    2. If the Customer acts on behalf of a legal entity or third party, upon request by Company, Customer shall provide Company with any contact or other information related to the true owner of the relevant Customer Account, which may include providing a valid identification or other proof of authorization.
    3. Customer agrees to abide by all U.S. Export Laws (as defined herein).
    4. Customer must notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized access or use of the Customer Account. Customer may be liable for any damages or loss Company or others incur caused by a breach of a Customer Account, whether caused by Customer or by an authorized person, or by an unauthorized person.
    5. Company will not be liable for any loss incurred due to any unauthorized use of a Customer Account. Customer may be liable for any loss Company or others incur, whether caused by Customer, or by an authorized person, or by an unauthorized person.
    6. If Customer or the Account is the initiator or target of a denial-of-service attack that adversely affects Company’s or a third party’s network, Company will terminate the Account without warning and Customer will be held responsible for any damages to Company and charges that may result from Customer’s action. Activities that attract denial-of-service attacks are expressly prohibited. Company will cooperate fully with all investigations (civil or criminal) of violations of systems or network security at other websites, including cooperating with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected criminal violations. A visitor, user or Customer who violates Company’s systems or network security may incur criminal or civil liability. Company reserves the right to charge up to $500.00 USD per complaint to investigate such claims and charge such to Customer.
6. Protection of Customer Data
    1. Company offers certain Products that may involve the processing of personal data about visitors, users and/or Customers (“Personal Data”) in the course of the use of the Website and Products (“Covered Data”). Personal Data, for the purpose of this Section, excludes any Customer Content. Company’s DPA, which is hereby incorporated by reference and applicable to Covered Data, provides Customer contractual assurance that Company has robust mechanisms to ensure the processing of Personal Data, including transfers of Personal Data from the European Economic Area to a third country, and meets with compliance under applicable data privacy laws.
    2. For the purposes of the DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses attached to the DPA (when and as applicable), visitors, users and/or Customers (and applicable affiliates) are considered the Data Controller/Data Exporter, visitor, user and/or Customer’s acceptance of the applicable terms of service governing Covered Data at the time of purchase of any Covered Data will also be treated as a visitor, user and/or Customer’s acknowledgement and acceptance of the DPA and its appendices (including the Standard Contractual Clauses and its appendices, as applicable). If a visitor, user and/or Customer wishes to print, sign and return a physical copy of the DPA, please send an email request to [\[email protected\]](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
7. Customer’s Responsibilities.
    1. Customer is solely responsible for the quality, performance and all other aspects of the Customer Content.
    2. Customer will cooperate fully with Company in connection with Company’s delivery and performance of the Products. Customer must provide any equipment or software that may be necessary for Customer to use the Products. Delays in Customer’s performance of its obligations under the Agreements will extend the time for Company’s performance of its obligations hereunder that depend on Customer’s performance on a day to day basis.
    3. Customer assumes full responsibility for providing any of its visitors, customers and/or end users with any required disclosure or explanation of the various features related to Customer Content and any goods or services described therein, as well as any rules, terms or conditions of use.
    4. Because the Products permit Customer to electronically transmit or upload content, Customer shall be fully and solely responsible for uploading, supplementing, modifying and updating the Customer Content.
    5. Customer is responsible for ensuring that the Customer Content and all aspects of the Customer Content are compatible with the hardware and software used by Company to provide the Products. Specifications for the hardware and software used by Company to provide the Products will be available on the Website, in the Customer Account or should be requested by Customer. Company shall not be responsible for any damages to the Customer Content or other damages, or malfunctions or service interruptions caused by any failure of the Customer Content or any aspect of the Customer Content to be compatible or incompatible with the hardware and/or software used by Company to provide the Products.

        3. Customer will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding the Customer Content and will use the Customer Content only for lawful purposes; and

9. Availability of the Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to provide the Website and Products on twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week basis, however, such up-time is not a guarantee. Customer understands, acknowledges and agrees that from time to time the Website and Products may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason including, but not limited to, equipment malfunctions, periodic maintenance, repairs or replacements that Company undertakes from time to time or causes beyond Company’s reasonable control or that are not reasonably foreseeable including, but not limited to, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, hostile network attacks, network congestion or other failures. Customer understands, acknowledges and agrees that Company has no control over the availability of the Website and Products on a “guaranteed” continuous or uninterrupted basis and that Company assumes no liability to Customer or any other party with regard thereto.
10. Monitoring of Content; License to Company.

            2. to comply with any applicable laws, government rules, or requirements, requests of law enforcement, or to avoid any liability, civil or criminal.
    3. Customer further agrees that Company shall not be liable to Customer for any loss or damages that may result from such conduct.

IN ORDER TO SEE THE RENEWAL SETTINGS APPLICABLE TO CUSTOMER AND THE PRODUCTS, CUSTOMER WILL NEED TO LOG INTO THE CUSTOMER ACCOUNT. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT WANT ANY SERVICE TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, CUSTOMER MAY ELECT TO CANCEL SUCH RENEWAL, IN WHICH CASE, THE SERVICES WILL TERMINATE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM, UNLESS CUSTOMER MANUALLY RENEWS THE PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THAT DATE (IN WHICH CASE THE PRODUCTS WILL AGAIN BE SET TO AUTOMATIC RENEWAL). FOR AVOIDANCE OF ANY DOUBT, SHOULD CUSTOMER ELECT TO CANCEL THE PRODUCTS AND FAIL TO MANUALLY RENEW THE PRODUCTS BEFORE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM, CUSTOMER MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF ACCESS TO THE PRODUCTS AND LOSS OF CUSTOMER CONTENT, AND COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING SUCH INTERRUPTION OR LOSS.

        5. COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR “ACCOUNT UPDATER SERVICES” SUPPORTED BY CUSTOMER’S CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (AND ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON CUSTOMER BANK’S PARTICIPATION). IF COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE CUSTOMER’S EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, CUSTOMER’S CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (OR CUSTOMER’S BANK) MAY NOTIFY COMPANY OF UPDATES TO CUSTOMER’S CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, OR MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE CUSTOMER’S NEW CREDIT CARD ON COMPANY BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO COMPANY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY RECURRING BILLING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT COMPANY IS NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE TO CUSTOMER’S CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, COMPANY MAY AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT PROFILE ON CUSTOMER’S BEHALF. COMPANY MAKES NO GUARANTEES THAT COMPANY WILL REQUEST OR RECEIVE CUSTOMER’S UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS CUSTOMER’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTAIN THE ACCOUNT SETTINGS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CANCELING THE SERVICES; AND ENSURING CUSTOMER’S ASSOCIATED PAYMENT METHOD(S) ARE CURRENT AND VALID. FURTHER, CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT CUSTOMER’S FAILURE TO DO SO, MAY RESULT IN THE INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF THE SERVICES, AND COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING SUCH INTERRUPTION OR LOSS.
        6. If for any reason Company is unable to charge Customer’s payment method for the full amount owed, or if Company receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to Customer’s payment method, Customer agrees that Company may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation of the Products, without notice to Customer. Company also reserves the right to charge Customer reasonable “administrative” fees” for tasks Company may perform outside the normal scope of its Products; additional time and/or costs Company may incur in providing the Products; and/or Customer’s noncompliance with the Agreements (as determined by Company in its sole and absolute discretion).

These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the payment method Customer has on file in the Customer Account.
        8. Company may offer pricing in various currencies. The transaction(s) will be processed in the selected currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount submitted for payment. For certain payment methods, the issuer of Customer’s payment method may charge Customer a foreign transaction fee or other charge(s), which may be added to the final amount that appears on Customer’s bank statement or post as a separate amount. Customer should check with the issuer of Customer’s payment method for details. In addition, regardless of the selected currency, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer may be charged Value Added Tax (“VAT”), Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on Customer’s bank and/or the country indicated in Customer’s billing address section in the Customer Account.
