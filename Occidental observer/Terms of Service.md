[![DONATE!](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ChristmasFrame-199x300r.png)](https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/donate/) First, a huge THANK YOU to those who have contributed during 2024. I’m not sure you really realize your _support is critical_ to our success and our ability to fulfill our unique niche of providing fact-based, well-written articles on White identity, White interests, Jewish influence, and the deleterious effects of multiculturalism and massive non-White immigration.

As you know, the Dissident Right, including _TOO_ has been widely de-platformed by the likes of PayPal, Patreon, Stripe, Square, and Coinbase (and others), so that mail-in checks (which can be set up with your bank on a recurrent basis) or cryptocurrency are the only options.

Your gifts of **any** amount are welcome. The best (and easiest) way of giving is to subscribe for a recurring monthly amount that works for you by using your bank’s bill-paying feature. Regarding crypto, we accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Litecoin, and Monero.

The page with information on donations is **[here](https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/donation/)**.

Your support is important for many of our writers, and it’s safe to say that we are now competitive with similar websites in paying them. As always, the financial base for projects like _TOO_ is dwarfed by the financial resources of our enemies. Your support is a huge psychological and financial boost for many.

[![Christmas-bell-36cc](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Christmas-bell-36cc.png)](https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/donate/)Again, the page with how to donate is [**here**](https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/donation/). This page has been updated to provide greater clarity. There are two sections, the top section for tax deductible donations and the bottom section for non-tax deductible donations respectively.

**[Let me know](mailto:editors@theoccidentalobserver.net)** if any of the instructions are unclear.

[![Donate to TOO](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ChristmasFrame-100x150r.png)](https://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/donate/)

Thanks for thinking of _TOO.  
…_ and Merry Christmas!
