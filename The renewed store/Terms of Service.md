Terms & Conditions
==================

The Renewed Store Limited - Terms of Service 
---------------------------------------------

By using our website, you accept our terms and conditions so please take a few minutes to read on. You’ll need to accept our terms & conditions every time you make a purchase – they may change from time to time. 

**OUR CONTRACT AFTER YOU HAVE ORDERED** 
----------------------------------------

Once you’re happy everything is correct, and you’ve submitted an order you’ll be given an Invoice number with details of the product(s) you have ordered along with the delivery tracking number.    
   
Occasionally there may be an unintentional error regarding information on the site (e.g. the price, description or availability of a product you have ordered). In this instance we may have to cancel your order at any time up to the point we send you the product(s), even if you have received your Invoice number email, and you will receive a full refund of any charges already paid. If this does happen, we will notify you immediately to offer an alternative product or update you with an estimated delivery date. 

**PRICES AND PAYMENTS** 
------------------------

All our prices are in UK pounds. The total cost of your order will be the price of the products you order. You’ll see all these in your Shopping Basket before you submit an order. Payment is processed once the order is submitted.  

**DELIVERY** 
-------------

All our items are delivered by courier (DPD or TNT Services) or by post to the delivery address provided when you place your order. Once your order is confirmed, we will endeavour to deliver the goods within the delivery period that applies to the option you have chosen.

As an online business we do not offer a store to visit or a collection service. 

**RETURNS / CANCELLATIONS**  
-----------------------------

You are entitled to a refund if you inform us within 30 days from the day of delivery, that you wish to return your order. The goods must be returned in an “as sold” condition and returned in the original, undamaged packaging, along with any accessories or free gifts received with it. The product must not have been used or have any data inputted. Whilst the goods are in your possession you must take reasonable care of them and not use them. 

**FAULTY GOODS** 
-----------------

In the unlikely event your product develops a fault, we try to make our returns option as swift and easy as possible. As soon as you discover that any goods are faulty you should notify us and one of our skilled engineers will help diagnose the problem. Faulty goods mean any goods we supply that do not conform to the Orders Product Description. 

We do not cover faults caused by accident, neglect, misuse, normal wear and tear by you or any third party, or any alteration or repair carried out without our prior approval.

Please ensure that any data is backed up prior to return. You may need the backup if your device needs to be reformatted during the repair process. The Renewed Store Limited are not responsible for any loss of data. 

**MISSING, DAMAGED OR INCORRECT ORDERS** 
-----------------------------------------

We do everything we can to ensure your order arrives at your door complete and as described.

If it’s not on its way you can contact us via [enquiries@therenewedstore.com](mailto:enquiries@therenewedstore.com). 

If your package arrives showing possible courier damage, you must inform us within 48 hours of the time of delivery. 

**WARRANTY** 
-------------

All machines are supplied with our 12-month Return to Base Hardware Warranty where faulty goods will be repaired or replaced with goods equal or greater in specification. As above, we do not cover faults caused by accident, neglect, misuse, normal wear and tear, or any alteration or repair carried out without our prior approval. 

**VAT** 
--------

All items sold will have VAT charged at the current rate, 20%, and the VAT component will be displayed separately on the invoice, hence allowing it to be reclaimed if you are a VAT registered business.
