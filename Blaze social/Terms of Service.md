There is a lot more information that some people like to keep private and may or may not allow a few of things above to be shown. However, you must respect other people's privacy so that they feel safe while using this website. Any violations of this rule will result in an immediate and permanent ban. It doesn't matter if you're doing this as some kind of joke or revenge. Sharing someone's private info is never a joke and it's one of the worst things you can do to someone as well as the people they care about. This even applies to consent from the person themselves to share info like their social security number, home address, IP address, bank accounts, or any log-in information that they own.  
  
There are a few exceptions. If you're hosting a public, in-person event, you are allowed to share the address of where the event will take place so people know how to get there. If you're willing to give your phone number or email information out like for example, businesses, fans, or anyone else to reach out to you for inquiries or business emails, you are more than welcome to do so. The same applies to a P.O BOX or another public place to receive mail. And if you're sharing the location, email, or phone number of your company, religious institution, university, or school, you are more than welcome to do so. And lastly, if you want to share your birthday, full name, or hometown you are free to do so. Do not share anything else of your own personal information, which is listed above. Abusing those exceptions will result in the content being removed.

5\. Hacking into anyone's account or attempting to breach being banned from any Blaze group by alt accounts will result in an immediate ban without warning. It's really important to do this as any account that gets hacked can be used for malicious purposes and it can lead to serious consequences in the long run.  
6\. Anyone who engages in any form of cat-fishing or predatory behavior will be permanently banned from Blaze.

7a. Any content meant to shock or disgust viewers is not allowed on Blaze. Examples include but are not limited to animal cruelty, gore, murder, and extreme violence. Anyone who posts this type of content will be banned under severe violations without any warning.

7b. Anything that discusses sexuality, extreme violence, or any form of disturbing topics from a scientific, educational, news-reporting, artistic, or documentary perspective can be allowed as long as some parts are censored to not disgust or shock viewers, and that you give proper context to the content to let viewers know that this is for one of the intended purposes and why. Anyone who uses this rule to try to get around violating our terms will have the content removed with a possibility of having a severe violation warning.

8\. Anyone spamming DMs or posts on Blaze with the intent to annoy or harass others will have the posts removed with each individual post or DM receiving a strike.

Those who do it will have their content or accounts permanently removed. Sponsorships from brand deals are the only exception to the rule, but they must be stated as such in order to viewers to know that they are affiliated with this brand or corporation. You are also allowed to promote your own website or other social media platforms in your posts as long as it doesn't interfere with other people's posts/groups and as long as you are not spamming it all over again.

13\. Defamation is not allowed on Blaze. Any content that slanders or commits libel will be removed. If you have a claim against someone, you must have a good reason as to why you're doing it and how it's actually true. Constructive criticism and feedback is allowed on Blaze, but using this to defame others will be banned. Again, it doesn't matter if you're doing this as a joke or revenge. It is never a joke as it can really affect other people as well as the people they care about. Deepfakes or AI use defaming other people will be an automatic ban if reported to us.

14\. AI-generated or deepfake content is allowed on Blaze as long as it doesn't violate the above terms and that people know that deepfake content has been used using a deepfake.

Making content that promotes a certain ideology or cult-like group/movement towards the vulnerable, will be removed off of Blaze and the account may receive a severe violation consequence depending on the content. This does not apply to those teaching people about religion or promoting religious values or content (ex. Holy Texts, Traditions, Cultures and Customs, etc).

Consequences

If the terms are violated, there will be consequences for breaking these terms. You won't be banned right away, unless there are severe violations (see above terms for more). We have the right to ban your account without warning. All posts that violate the terms will be deleted and you will be informed via email, DM, and/or phone number.

​

The consequences are as follows:

First offense: You will receive a warning from us. You will be informed of your actions and we won't penalize your account. We will give you a link to the Terms of Service so you know what is and isn't allowed on Blaze so you know to not violate the terms of service again.

Second offense: Your account will receive a strike. This strike is known as a "Term Strike", and these strikes are only given to those who violate the Terms of Service. Your account will be suspended for 1 week, and your account will be ineligible for verification for at least 30 days. If your account gets suspended, then you will not be able to access Blaze until your suspension is over.

Third offense: Your account will receive another strike. This time, you will be suspended for 2 weeks, and your account will be ineligible for verification for 6 months.

Fourth offense: Your account will receive another strike. This time, you will be suspended for 30 days, and your account will be ineligible for verification for 1 year.

Fifth or severe offense: Your account will receive a final strike. If you receive this strike or if there is a severe violation of the terms of service, your account will be banned. If your account gets banned, you will be blocked off of this website, and all posts and other content you post will be deleted from your account. You will also be prohibited from creating any other account on Blaze, and you will be prohibited from accessing the platform or any of its services in the future.

​

If you believe that this account is banned by mistake, you will be able to appeal the ban by contacting Blaze Support on Blaze. Your account will then be reviewed for up to 30 days, and if we find that we did make a mistake on your account, your strikes and bans will be lifted, and it will be removed off of the servers. We have the right to deny any appeals made to us and rescind any accepted appeals at any time. 

​

What isn't allowed in the appeals are things like, "It's just a joke" or "It's all just an act" or "I'm a changed man, I promise" or "I won't do it again" or "I know I did it but..." as they aren't sufficient reasons on why you appealed in the first place and why the consequences should be lifted. We all make mistakes, including us. However, we must follow all the policies and do our job to ensure that we protect users from feeling unsafe or horrible about using this platform because of other people breaking the rules.

​

ANY SEVERE VIOLATIONS THAT BREAK THE LAW WILL BE REPORTED TO THE APPROPRIATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES AND YOU WILL FACE A HIGH POSSIBILITY OF SWIFT, RELENTLESS, FAR-REACHING, AND DECISIVE LEGAL ACTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN AGAINST YOU. WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LEGAL REPERCUSSIONS THAT YOU FACE FOR BREAKING THE LAW BY USING THIS WEBSITE.

TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ANY DATA WE COLLECT, CHECK OUT OUR [PRIVACY POLICY.](https://www.blazeapp.net/privacy-policy) THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAW AND GET BANNED WILL HAVE EVERY APPEAL DENIED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

​

These are all the terms for now. We have the right to change these rules at any time, but we won't do so without informing you about it first. Thank you for using Blaze, the flame of social media!
