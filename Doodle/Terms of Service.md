General Terms and Conditions
----------------------------

### 1\. Basic Principles

**1.1 Scope of application**

These General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter “GTC”) for Users of [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) govern the access to and use of the Services of Doodle AG (“Doodle”) and all transactions incidental thereto, which are offered online via www.doodle.com or www.doodle.ch or other top-level domains as part of a software-as-a-service solution. Please read these GTC carefully before using the Services, as your use of the Services, opening of an account or your order for subscription, whichever comes first, shall be construed as your acceptance of the terms of the GTC. Your acceptance of the GTC shall be construed as your agreement to be bound by the terms of the GTC with respect to your access and use of the Services. No other terms or conditions shall be of any force or effect unless otherwise specifically agreed upon by Doodle in writing duly executed by an authorized officer of Doodle.

Doodle may refuse any order for subscription for any or no reason. No order for subscription shall be binding upon Doodle until Doodle’s written confirmation of payment of the subscription fee.

Unless otherwise agreed by Doodle in writing, the GTC and the other provisions, including but not limited to the [Permitted Use Policy](https://doodle.com/en/general-data-processing-terms/) for Doodle Services, the [Privacy Policy](https://doodle.com/en/privacy-policy/) and the [Service Level Agreement](https://doodle.com/en/permitted-use-policy/) referred to in these GTC, as such may be amended by Doodle unilaterally from time to time (the “Ancillary Documents and Policies”) together with any terms on Doodle’s email confirmation (the “Subscription Confirmation”) constitute the entire agreement between you and Doodle, and shall supersede any and all prior written or oral agreements, offers or other representations with respect to the Services. In the event of conflict between the terms of these GTCs, the Ancillary Documents and Policies and the Subscription Confirmation, the order of precedence shall be as follows: 1. The Subscription Confirmation; 2. these GTC; 3. the Permitted Use Policy for Doodle Services, 4. the Service Level Agreement and 5. the Privacy Policy. If you access or use the Services or continue to use the Services after you have been notified of a change to the GTC or other referenced documents, you confirm that you have read, understood and agree to the GTC and all such referenced documents, as amended.

**1.2 Definitions**

**User**: shall mean any individual or entity using the Services either with or without creating an account with Doodle and who shall be bound to these GTC, the Ancillary Documents and Policies and Subscription Confirmation.
