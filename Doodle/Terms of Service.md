The Subscription Confirmation; 2. these GTC; 3. the Permitted Use Policy for Doodle Services, 4. the Service Level Agreement and 5. the Privacy Policy.

B. **Data Subject Requests.** If an Invitee, a Customer employee, or other applicable Data Subject makes a Data Subject Request to Doodle, Doodle will advise the Data Subject to submit their request directly to the Doodle customer who is the applicable Controller of that Personal Data, and will inform Customer of such request if the Data Subject identifies Customer as the applicable Controller to Doodle.
