SECTION 13 – DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------

We do not guarantee, represent or warrant that your use of our service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free.

We do not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable.

You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the service at any time, without notice to you.

You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The service and all products and services delivered to you through the service are (except as expressly stated by us) provided ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ for your use, without any representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement.

In no case shall Pilot Institute, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any products procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.  
 

SECTION 14 – AFFILIATES
-----------------------

In addition to the agreement below, affiliates are also subject to any terms and conditions that our learning management system (Teachable) has and the welcome letter that we send to affiliates.  
 

Pilot Institute has an affiliate program that allows people to earn a commission on sales. Pilot Institute has the sole right to choose who can be an affiliate and can revoke anyone’s access to the affiliate program at any time and for any reason.  
 

Affiliates do not earn commissions on free courses nor on free or paid enrollments into our community. Cookies are set for a minimum of 7 days. If a user uses a different browser, device, or clears cookies sales may not be credited to affiliates. Only sales where the affiliate cookie is present during checkout will result in commission. Additionally, we might generate a custom coupon code for some affiliates. However, your affiliate code still must be present at checkout for you to receive a commission on those sales. Pilot Institute does not assign sales based on coupon code usage alone at this time. Linking directly to the learn.pilotinstitute.com checkout page with your affiliate code in the URL is the least error-prone way to ensure your affiliate code is present at checkout.

By becoming an affiliate you agree not to use spam or other methods that could undermine the Pilot Institute brand in the eyes of potential customers. You also agree that you will only advertise affiliate links to our website if you have permission from the receiver to send them.  
 

If a customer asks for a refund and Pilot Institute provides it, this will reduce the earnings of an affiliate. Affiliates only earn commissions on non-refunded transactions. Additionally, Pilot Institute will not pay for fraudulent transactions or in cases where the affiliate used spam or other unauthorized promotional techniques.  
 

Affiliates may not run paid ads (Google, Bing, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn etc) without the express written permission of Pilot Institute. Affiliates may also not add coupon codes or affiliate links to coupon websites. Affiliates are responsible for adhering to any laws that may pertain to their efforts.  
 

Pilot Institute strives to keep our website and classes available. However, service interruptions are inevitable. Pilot Institute offers no guarantees that our website will be available and we will not pay any compensation or damages of any kind that may result from any outages or from withdrawing our affiliate relationship from you.  
 

Pilot Institute may provide you with access to our logos, advertising material, course materials, and more when you become an affiliate. Pilot Institute owns these assets exclusively and in their entirety. Once the affiliate agreement is terminated, affiliates must immediately cease their use of these assets and trademarks/copyrighted materials owned by Pilot Institute when requested.  
 

Pilot Institute does not offer commissions for signups to our TRUST program, nor will any affiliate links sent to such pages be tracked for the purposes of providing an affiliate with a commission.  
 

SECTION 15 – COMMUNITY
----------------------

Pilot Institute has a community for our students. You agree that Pilot Institute can create a profile for you when you enroll in free and paid classes. Your profile lists the classes you have enrolled in, whether you have graduated, if you received a perfect score on your exam, and other information. There is also a leaderboard system in the community. Other members can search your profile in the community.

The leaderboard for the community is publicly accessible.

Pilot Institute offers perks for tiers in the leaderboard. Pilot Institute can change the way points and perks are accumulated or assigned without any notice. Our system may also fail to accurately assign points for activities. You recognize that if this occurs Pilot Institute may not be able to assign points in the future for these missed activities.

Pilot Institute may remove points from a user at its sole discretion for any reason. Common reasons why points may be removed is in the case of spam where a user creates bulk comments, posts, or likes.

Pilot Institute may also elect to remove perks for points at any time and for any reason. If Pilot Institute decides to withdraw perks from the leaderboard, we have no obligation to send the perk to users who have no already reached the level of points required to reach the perk. The leaderboard may also be removed entirely from the community without notice.

SECTION 16 – INDEMNIFICATION
----------------------------

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pilot Institute and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.

SECTION 17 – SEVERABILITY
-------------------------

In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

SECTION 18 – TERMINATION
------------------------

The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.

These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site.

If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof).

SECTION 19 – ENTIRE AGREEMENT
-----------------------------

The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to The Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).

Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.

SECTION 20 – GOVERNING LAW

SECTION 21 – CHANGES TO TERMS OF SERVICE
----------------------------------------

You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at this page.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to update, change or replace any part of these Terms of Service by posting updates and changes to our website. It is your responsibility to check our website periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to our website or the Service following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.
