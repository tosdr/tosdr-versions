**PRIVACY & COOKIES POLICY**

 **Spongy Elephant takes the privacy of all visitors to this Website very seriously.**

Our website uses cookies, as almost all websites do, to help provide you with the best experience we can. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile phone when you browse websites

 **Our cookies help us:**

*  Continuously improve our website for you
* Make our website work as you’d expect
* Improve the speed/security of the site

 **We do not use cookies to:**

 Collect any personally identifiable information (without your express permission)

* Collect any sensitive information (without your express permission)

* Pass personally identifiable data to third parties

*  You can learn more about all the cookies we use below.

 **GRANTING US PERMISSION TO USE COOKIES**

If the settings on your software that you are using to view this website (your browser) are adjusted to accept cookies, we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this.

Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site, you can do so. However, this will mean that our site may not work as you would expect.

 **COOKIES IN USE ON THIS SITE**

**ANONYMOUS VISITOR STATISTICS**

We use Google Analytics to anonymously track how people use our website.

We use anonymous cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website.

These analytics services also tell us, on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before.

It is important to note that Spongy Elephant never collects or stores any identifiable information about our site users, except where they give express permission (for example, by submitting details on registration or other online forms).

 **THIRD PARTY FUNCTION COOKIES**

Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. For example we embed Vimeo and YouTube videos in some of our Learning Trunks. Our site includes the following services, some of which use cookies:

*  Surveys
* Quizzes
* Ratings
* Video and photo galleries
* MailChimp
* eCommerce
* Sessions

**Disabling cookies will likely break the functions offered by these type of third party services.**

 **TURNING COOKIES OFF**

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies. However, doing this will limit the functionality of a large number of sites, as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites.

 Rather than switching off cookies in your browser, you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.

 **Data Subjects Rights**

We’re fully committed to upholding your rights as data subjects
