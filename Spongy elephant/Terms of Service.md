Terms and Conditions
--------------------

_Welcome to our website. If you continue to browse and use this website, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions of use, which, together with our privacy policy, govern Spongy Elephant’s relationship with you in relation to this website. If you disagree with any part of these terms and conditions, please do not use our website._

**Spongy Elephant** is an online market place where users can buy and sell short format streamed training videos and webinars. We aim to ensure all the videos are less than 3 minutes long. We call them learning bursts as they are designed to help people learn as quickly and efficiently as possible, and also minimise forgetting.

These learning bursts are grouped in to sets of roughly 10. These groups are called “learning trunks”. The learning trunks contain 1 or 2 initial videos or learning bursts that are in a Get Going section. These give an introduction to the topic being covered. There are then a number of learning bursts that are in a section called Get Better, which incrementally offer the learner more information and guidance. Finally there is a Get Ahead section. This is not always a video but sometimes a list or collection of next steps for the learner who is now prepared to engage with the subject matter as an informed person and look for further more advanced training through the signposting offered in this final learning burst(s).

The learning trunks and learning bursts are designed so that activities can be tackled in short bursts, spaced over time. This helps learners remember over time and also reduces the need for large blocks of time away from school/the workplace to learn in the first place.

Spongy Elephant learning bursts and learning trunks have been designed to be particularly helpful for busy learners on the go (on the bus or train in to school), who can use mobile devices to access learning in short bursts of ‘found time’.

In terms of gamification, the learners progress and attainment on the Learning Trunks they undertake is represented by an elephant avatar. Currently there are three levels to both progress and attainment. No or weak progress is depicted by a grey elephant body; reasonable progress by a blue elephant body; and good progress by a green elephant body. Attainment uses the same colours and performance measures but as a circular ring around the elephant. So good progress is shown with a green ring.

This means that an administrator can monitor the progress and attainment of their “herd” using simple visual stimuli. If the “herd” is the teachers at the school using SE then good progress and attainment of staff undertaking continuous professional development or CPD, will be shown by a green herd.

To initiate the mediation, a party must serve notice in writing (an “ADR Notice”) to the other party to the Dispute, requesting mediation. A copy of the ADR Notice should be sent to CEDR Solve. The mediation will start not later than 10 Business Days after the date of the ADR Notice.

2. If the Dispute is not resolved within 1 month of the mediator’s appointment, then either party may commence Court proceedings, but provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent either party seeking an injunction or other interim relief at any time if it reasonably believes such action is necessary to prevent irreparable damage.

16. GENERAL

1. Save where the Customer is a governing body, multi-academy trust or other entity with jurisdiction over at least one Educational Establishment, each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.
2. This agreement shall not prevent SE from entering into similar agreements with third parties, or from independently developing, using, selling or licensing materials, products or services which are similar to those provided hereunder.
3. Confidentiality: A party (“Receiving Party”) shall keep in strict confidence all technical or commercial know-how, specifications, inventions, processes or initiatives which are of a confidential nature and have been disclosed to Receiving Party by the other party (“Disclosing Party”), its employees, agents or subcontractors, and any other confidential information concerning Disclosing Party’s business or its products or its services which Receiving Party may obtain. Receiving Party shall restrict disclosure of such information to such of its employees, agents or subcontractors as need to know it to discharge Receiving Party’s obligations under this agreement, and shall ensure that such employees, agents or subcontractors are subject to obligations of confidentiality corresponding to those which bind Receiving Party. This clause shall survive termination.
4. Entire Agreement: This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, superseding all previous arrangements relating to its subject matter. Any samples, drawings, descriptive matter, illustrations and advertising issued by SE or contained in SE’s websites, catalogues or brochures are issued and/or published for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Platform and/or Services. They shall not form part of this agreement or have any contractual force. The Customer confirms it has not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of SE which is not set out in the agreement. No party shall have any claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation based upon any statement in the agreement.
5. Force majeure: SE shall not be liable to the Customer as a result of any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this agreement as a result of a Force Majeure Event.
6. Assignment and subcontracting: SE may at any time assign, transfer, novate, charge, subcontract, sub-licence and/or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights under this agreement. The Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of SE, assign, transfer, novate, charge, subcontract, sub-licence or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under this agreement.
7. Variation/Waiver: Except as set out in this agreement, any variation, including the introduction of any additional terms and conditions shall only be binding when agreed in writing and signed by SE. A waiver of any right is only effective if it is in writing and shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right or remedy under this agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor preclude or restrict its further exercise. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. Unless specifically provided otherwise, rights arising under this agreement are cumulative and do not exclude rights provided by law.
8. Severance: If a court or any other competent authority finds that any provision (or part of a provision) of this agreement is invalid/illegal/unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this agreement shall not be affected. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable and legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with the minimum modification necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable.
9. No partnership: Nothing in this agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, constitute a partnership/joint venture of any kind between any of the parties, nor constitute any party the agent of another party for any purpose. No party shall have authority to act as agent for, or to bind, the other party in any way.
10. Third parties: A person not a party to this agreement shall not have any rights under/in connection with it.
11. Compliance with law: The Customer shall at all times comply (and shall ensure that relevant third parties comply) with Applicable Law, including the Bribery Act 2010.
12. Governing law and jurisdiction: This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, English law and the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
