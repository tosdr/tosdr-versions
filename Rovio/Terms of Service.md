Terms of Service (“TOS”)
------------------------

#### Effective Date: May 24, 2024.

### Welcome.

These terms of service (“**TOS**”) apply to you and Rovio Entertainment Limited, address Keilaranta 7, 02150 Espoo, Finland, (“**Rovio**”) regarding your use of Rovio´s games, websites, discussion forums, and related services (“**Services**“). Use of the Services is also governed by Rovio’s Privacy Notice (available at [https://www.rovio.com/privacy](https://www.rovio.com/privacy)), which is incorporated by reference.

**For United States residents, these TOS contain a binding arbitration clause in Section “Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver” and a class-action waiver that affects your rights about how to resolve disputes. If you live in the United States, please read it carefully. Except where you opt out, and except for certain types of disputes described in Section** **“Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver”****, you agree that any disputes arising between you and Rovio will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and you waive your right to participate in any class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.**

As a precondition for using the Services, you must agree to these TOS. If you accept these TOS, you represent that you are of the age of majority in your country of residence. If you are under the age of majority or otherwise do not have the authority to enter into agreements such as these TOS, you represent that your legal guardian, or a holder of parental responsibility, has reviewed and agreed to these TOS.

**By using or otherwise accessing the Services, you agree to these TOS. If you do not agree to these TOS, you may not use or otherwise access the Services.**

Unless otherwise specified, **the Services do not require you to pay money to use or download but may contain features that may allow you to make purchases within the Services.** You may be required to have an internet connection to access or use the Services. You are responsible for any internet connectivity or mobile charges you may incur by accessing or using the Services.

If you access the Services from a third-party platform such as Facebook or another social networking site, you agree to comply with the platform’s terms of service as well as these TOS.

Rovio may issue additional terms or policies related to individual Services or specific components of the Services (including, but not limited to, forums, contests, sweepstakes, or loyalty programs). Your right to use the Services is subject to such relevant terms and policies as well as these TOS.

### 1\. Right to Use the Services

Subject to these TOS, Rovio hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use the Services for your personal, non-commercial use. The rights granted to you are subject to your compliance with these TOS.

Except as set forth above, you do not receive any other license. Rovio retains all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including, but not limited to, all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names, proprietary rights, patents, titles, computer codes, audiovisual effects, themes, characters, character names, stories, dialogue, settings, artwork, sound effects, musical works, gameplay recordings made using the Services, moral rights, in each case whether registered or not and all applications thereof. Unless expressly authorized by applicable law, the Services may not be copied, reproduced, or distributed in any manner or medium, in whole or in part, without Rovio’s prior written consent. Rovio reserves all rights not expressly granted to you herein.

**The Services and their content are licensed, not sold.** You agree that you have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Services, including, but not limited to, the Virtual Items appearing in or originating from the Services, whether earned in the Services or purchased from Rovio or its authorized partners.

### 2\. Purchases in the Services

Rovio may license to you certain virtual goods or other content (_e.g._ in-game items or currency) which may be used within the Services and which you may purchase with “real world” money or earn or redeem through gameplay (“**Virtual Items**“). Virtual Items are licensed to you on a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable basis solely for non-commercial use.

Unless expressly authorized in the Services, you may only purchase Virtual Items from Rovio or its authorized partner and the transfer or sale of Virtual Items is prohibited.

Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real world money and are not a substitute for real world money. Neither Rovio nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value. Rovio is not liable for hacking or loss of your Virtual Items.

Price and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.

**All purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through the Services are final and non-refundable.** You acknowledge and consent that Virtual Items are provided to you immediately upon purchase and that you forfeit any right to cancel or withdraw from the purchase once the process has commenced. **Accordingly, you agree that Rovio is not required to provide a refund for Virtual Items for any reason. You further acknowledge that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, regardless of whether your loss of license under these TOS was voluntary or involuntary.** The foregoing does not affect your rights under applicable law, including those you may have based on the legal guarantee of conformity described in Section “Disclaimer”.

**If you ask for your personal data to be deleted as described in Rovio’s Privacy Notice, you will permanently forfeit all of your Virtual Items without the right to refund, as Rovio will no longer be able associate such Virtual Items with you.**

### 3\. Right of Withdrawal

If you are a consumer based in the European Union or a member country of the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), this Section applies to you.

You may have the right to withdraw from these TOS within 14 days from the day you agreed to them. You may also have the right to withdraw from the purchase of a license to a Virtual Item or a Service within 14 days from purchase. You are not required to give a reason for exercising the right of withdrawal. However, you are not entitled to withdraw from a purchase if you have consented to the Virtual Item or Service being fully provided to you during the withdrawal period and acknowledged that you thereby forfeit your right of withdrawal.

To withdraw from these TOS, you must inform Rovio of your decision to withdraw and discontinue your use of the Services. To withdraw from the purchase of a license to a Virtual Item or a Service, you must inform the merchant of record, which may be either Rovio or its authorized partner through whom you made the purchase. Please note that Rovio is neither able nor required to fulfill your request to withdraw from a purchase where Rovio is not the merchant of record.

To inform Rovio of your decision to withdraw, you must send an equivocal statement of your decision by email to support@rovio.com. You may use the [attached model withdrawal form](https://www.rovio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Model-Withdrawal-Form.pdf) but are not required to do so. To meet the deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the expiry of the withdrawal period.

If you withdraw from the purchase of a license to a Virtual Item or a Service, you are entitled to be reimbursed for the purchase without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you informed the merchant of record of your decision to withdraw from the purchase. The reimbursement will be carried out using the same means of payment as you used for the initial payment, unless you have agreed otherwise. You will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

You agree to compensate Rovio for any losses or harm that result from your failure to keep your Login Information confidential.

**You agree that you have no ownership or property interest in or to any Account.** Rovio reserves the right to delete your Account if Rovio observes no activity by you in relation to the Account for 180 days or more. **In such event, you may no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Items associated with that Account and no refund will be offered to you.**

### 6\. User Contributions

The Services may allow you to create and/or submit content, including, but not limited to, gameplay maps, game profiles, fan art, characters, items, screenshots or videos of your gameplay (collectively “**User Contributions**”).

In exchange for use of the Services, you hereby grant Rovio a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully transferable and sub-licensable worldwide right and license to use your User Contributions in any way and for any purposes including, but not limited to, the right to reproduce, copy, adapt, modify, perform, display, publish, broadcast, transmit, or otherwise communicate to the public by any current or future means and to distribute your User Contributions without any further notice or compensation to you of any kind. Where not expressly prohibited by applicable law, you hereby waive any moral rights of paternity, publication, reputation, or attribution with respect to Rovio’s (including its licensees, successors, and assigns) and other players’ use and enjoyment of your User Contributions in connection with the Services and related goods and services. The foregoing grant of license to Rovio and waiver of any applicable moral rights survives any termination of these TOS.

Rovio and its directors, officers and employees do not accept or consider unsolicited idea or product submissions of any kind (_e.g_. game or other product ideas, stories, screenplays, artwork, musical or audiovisual works, concepts or any other creative materials) in any format, by means of any transmission (“**Unsolicited Content**”). Please do not submit any Unsolicited Content to Rovio or its directors, officers, or employees. However, if you submit Unsolicited Content to us, you agree that such Unsolicited Content will not be treated as confidential, regardless of any statement to the contrary in the Unsolicited Content, any accompanying message, or elsewhere. You further agree that such Unsolicited Content may be used and exploited by Rovio without compensation to you or any third party and you grant Rovio a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully paid, royalty free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or in part) worldwide license to use, exploit, reproduce, transmit, amend, display and exhibit Unsolicited Content in all current or future media for any purpose and to create derivative works based upon the Unsolicited Content.

### 7\. User Interactions

Rovio assumes no responsibility for the conduct of other users of the Services or for monitoring the Services for inappropriate content or conduct. Rovio does not, and cannot, pre-screen or monitor all content or conduct of users. Your use of the Services is at your own risk.

By using the Services, you may be exposed to content or conduct that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise not in line with your values. Rovio may utilize technology to monitor and/or record your interactions with the Services or communications within the Services (including, but not limited to, chat text or voice communications). **You irrevocably consent to such monitoring and recording and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any content within the Services, including, but not limited to, chat text or voice communications.** You understand that your User Contributions, communications within the Services, and/or your interactions with the Services may be displayed to or viewable by other users of the Services or the general public.

Rovio reserves the right at its sole discretion to review, monitor, prohibit, edit, delete, disable access to, or otherwise make unavailable any content made available by users of the Service without notice for any reason or for no reason at any time. If at any time Rovio chooses, at its sole discretion, to monitor the Services, Rovio nonetheless assumes no responsibility for content made available by users of the Services, and Rovio assumes no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate content.

**You acknowledge that Rovio is not a party to any dispute you may have with any other user(s) of the Services. Rovio has no obligation to become involved in any such dispute.** You release Rovio and its subsidiaries (and Rovio’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, shareholders and employees) from all claims, demands, and damages related to any such dispute.

### 8\. Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver

**If you are a United States resident or otherwise make any claim against Rovio in the United States, you expressly agree that any legal claim, dispute or other controversy between you and Rovio arising out of or otherwise relating in any way to Services, including controversies relating to the applicability, enforceability or validity of any provision of these TOS or Rovio’s Privacy Notice (collectively “Disputes”), shall be resolved in confidential binding arbitration conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), rather than in a court, as described herein. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s commercial arbitration rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”). You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly forfeiting your right to a trial by jury and to otherwise proceed in a lawsuit in state or federal court.**

Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA’s fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Rovio will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. Rovio also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses.

The arbitration may be conducted in Los Angeles, California or, upon your request, in the city closest to your location where AAA maintains an office. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on you and Rovio and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at www.adr.org.

As an exception to the binding arbitration rule, to the extent the Dispute arises from:

1. A violation of Rovio’s intellectual property rights in any manner;
2. Any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the United States Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or Section “Code of Conduct” of these TOS; and
3. Any claim for equitable relief;

then both parties agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any court with jurisdiction over the other party. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.

To the extent permissible under applicable law, all Disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis. You expressly agree that no other Disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your Dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. **You and Rovio agree that there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures, there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity or as a private attorney general, and no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration.**

You may opt out of this obligation to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Rovio can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Rovio in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: Rovio Entertainment Limited, ATTN: Legal Department, Keilaranta 7, 02150 Espoo, Finland. You must include your name and residence address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration clause.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter to: Rovio Entertainment Limited, ATTN: Legal Department, Keilaranta 7, 02150 Espoo, Finland requesting arbitration and describing your claim.

Rovio will provide 30-days’ notice of any changes to this Section “Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver” through the Services or via other similar means. Changes will become effective on the 30th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 30th day.

### 9\. Suspension and Termination for your Breach

Without limiting any other remedies available to Rovio, if Rovio believes that you are in breach of these TOS, Rovio reserves the right to take any of the following actions, whether individually or in combination, and either with or without notice to you: (i) delete, suspend, and/or modify your Account or parts of your Account; (ii) limit, suspend and/or terminate your access to the Services; (iii) modify and/or remove any of your Virtual Items; (iv) reset and/or modify any game progression or benefits and privileges associated with you, such as any level or score you have reached in the Services.

### 10\. Availability, Compatibility, and Changes to the Services

**Rovio does not guarantee that the Services are available at all times or will continue to be available in the future.** The Services may be temporarily unavailable due to technical issues or maintenance related reasons, which may occur on a scheduled or unscheduled basis. Furthermore, the Services or parts thereof may be designed to be available only for a limited time (_e.g._ when content is seasonal or early access is provided to a development version of a game), or their life cycle may be affected by technological developments or changes in consumer behavior. Accordingly, Rovio reserves the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or parts thereof (_e.g_. a game or a feature of a game) at any time, at which point your license to use the Services or such parts thereof will be terminated automatically. **In such an event, unless otherwise required by applicable law, Rovio does not have to provide refunds for the Services or any Virtual Items.** Where appropriate, Rovio will take reasonable measures to provide advance notice when any Services or parts thereof are discontinued. However, Rovio may limit, suspend or terminate the Services or parts thereof without notice, and take technical and legal steps to prevent you from accessing the Services, if Rovio believes you or any other user(s) are causing a risk of legal liability or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or are not acting in accordance with the letter or spirit of these TOS.

**The Services may have limited compatibility across different devices and operating systems. You are responsible for verifying that the Services are compatible with your device and its operating system.** Generally, more information regarding compatibility requirements is available at the point of first use or download (_e.g._ in the relevant app store).

The Services are intended to evolve over time. **Accordingly, Rovio may change, manage, modify, or update the Services or parts thereof (including, but not limited to, Virtual Items) from time to time.** This may result in content or features being added, removed, or modified (_e.g._ gameplay modes or areas being added or removed or Virtual Items having their appearance or power altered). Rovio may, at its sole discretion, make any such changes as it believes to be necessary to maintain and improve the Services, including, but not limited to, introducing, modifying, or removing game content and features according to Rovio’s development roadmap, adapting to new technologies, reflecting changes to Rovio’s agreements with third parties, preventing abuse or technical issues, and addressing any legal, safety, or regulatory requirements. When changes are made to the Services, you may be required to download and install an update to continue using them. If you do not, you may be unable to access or use the Services or parts thereof (_e.g._ online play and features may only be available to those who are using the latest version of a game).

### 11\. Disclaimer

**To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, the Services are provided to you “AS IS,” without warranty, assurances, or guarantees of any kind. The Services may have defects, and your use is solely at your risk. Rovio does not make, and hereby disclaims any and all express, implied or statutory warranties, including implied warranties of condition, uninterrupted use, accuracy of data (including, but not limited to, location data), merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights, and warranties (if any) arising in the course of dealing, usage, or trade practices. Rovio does not warrant against interference with your enjoyment of the Services; that the Services will meet your requirements; that operation of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free; that the Services will interoperate or be compatible with any other services; or, that any errors in the Services will be corrected. No oral or written advice provided by Rovio, its employees or other representatives constitute a warranty.**

Some jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers such as those set forth above; thus, the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing disclaimers shall only apply to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Moreover, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these TOS shall infringe upon the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services. Specifically, if you are a consumer based in the EEA, you are provided with a legal guarantee of conformity under which Rovio may be liable for a lack of conformity that you discover: (i) within two years from any one-time supply of the Services (such as the supply of a Virtual Item); or (ii) at any time during any continuous supply of the Services.

### 12\. Limitations of Liability

In no event will Rovio be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from access, use or malfunction of the Services, including, but not limited to, damages to property, loss of goodwill, device failure or malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law, damages for personal injuries, property damage, lost profits or punitive damages from any causes of action arising out of or related to these TOS or the Services, whether arising in tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability or otherwise and whether or not Rovio has been advised of the possibility of such damages. **In no event will Rovio’s total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these TOS, the Privacy Notice, or the Services exceed the higher of: (i) the actual price (if any) you paid for the license to use Virtual Items or Services; or (ii) one hundred euros (€100). The exclusions and limitations of damages are fundamental elements of the basis of the agreement between Rovio and you.** For purposes of this Section “Limitations of Liability,” Rovio’s licensors and other partners are third-party beneficiaries to the limitations of liability specified herein and may enforce these TOS against you.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability such as those stated in this Section; thus, the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the limitations of liability in this Section shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Moreover, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these TOS will infringe upon any statutory rights you may have as a consumer of the Services.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Rovio and its subsidiaries (and Rovio’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, shareholders and employees) harmless from any claim, demand, damages, or other losses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, asserted by any third party resulting from or arising out of your use of the Services or any breach by you of these TOS; however, the foregoing does not apply if the third-party claim is not attributable to your intentional or negligent behavior.

### 13\. Copyright and DMCA

If you believe the Services or any of its content infringes your copyrights, please send a notice to: Rovio Entertainment Limited, Legal Department, Keilaranta 7, 02150 Espoo, Finland or alternatively via email to: legal@rovio.com. Notices sent to the specified address will reach Rovio’s registered DMCA agent.

Please include all of the following in your DMCA notice:

* Identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If your DMCA notice covers multiple works, you may provide a representative list of such works.
* Identify what you claim is the infringing material, including a description of where the material is located. Your description must be reasonably sufficient to enable Rovio to locate the material.
* Provide your full legal name, mailing address, telephone number, and (if available) email address.

Include the following statement in the body of the DMCA notice:

“I have a good-faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I represent that the information in this DMCA notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that I am the owner of the copyright or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.”

Please note that under 17 U.S.C. 512(f), if you knowingly misrepresent that a material or activity is causing infringement, you may be liable for damages, including the costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by Rovio or its users. If you are unsure whether the material or activity you are reporting is causing infringement, you may wish to contact an attorney before serving a notice to Rovio.

### 14\. Third-party Products and Services

The Services may link to or otherwise make available third-party products or services, including, but not limited to, through third-party advertisements, connectivity to social media or community services, or gameplay recording or sharing services. These products and services are subject to the respective third party’s terms and conditions. Please read these third-party terms and conditions carefully as they constitute an agreement between you and the relevant third-party service provider to which Rovio is not a party. You understand that Rovio neither endorses nor makes any promises regarding the content, goods or services provided by such third parties. Rovio is not liable to you for any losses or harm caused by such third parties or any charges you incur in relation to such third parties. You understand that when you provide data to such third parties you are providing it in accordance with their privacy policy (if any) and you understand Rovio’s Privacy Notice does not apply to such data.

### 15\. Changes to these TOS

Notwithstanding Section “Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver,” Rovio may update these TOS from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When Rovio updates these TOS, Rovio will take appropriate measures to inform you via the Services or otherwise, in accordance with the significance of the changes made.

By continuing to access or use the Services after updates become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated TOS.

### 16\. Governing Law

If you are a United States resident, in addition to Section “Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver,” these TOS are governed by the laws of the State of California and applicable federal laws regardless of conflict of law provisions.

If you are a resident outside the United States, you agree that all disputes between you and Rovio shall be governed by the laws of Finland, regardless of conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may file against Rovio must be resolved exclusively by a court located in Espoo, Finland. If you are a consumer based in the EEA, you may also make use of the [Online Dispute Resolution platform](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr) offered by the European Commission as an out-of-court alternative to resolve disputes. Please note that Rovio may not be required to accept the use of this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.

If the jurisdiction of your domicile prohibits Rovio from enforcing the governing law provision, nothing in these TOS limits your rights based on the laws governing your domicile.

### 17\. General

**Entire Agreement**. These TOS set out the entire agreement between you and Rovio regarding the Services and supersede all earlier agreements and understandings between you and Rovio.

**Assignment**. Rovio may assign these TOS, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, provided that such assignment does not reduce your rights under these TOS. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these TOS without Rovio’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.
