    When you visit our Social Media pages, data is processed both by us and by the responsible social media provider.
    
    In some cases the respective provider of Social Media assumes the data protection obligations towards you as the user, such as information on data processing, and is the contact person for your rights. This results from the fact that such provider has direct access to the relevant information on the Social Media page and the processing of your data. However, you are also welcome to contact us if this should become necessary and we will then forward the request to the respective provider if necessary.
    
    When using the Social Media providers set forth above data may also be processed outside the EU. We take steps with our Social Media partners to ensure that, in any transfer of your data, they are contractually bound to ensure an essentially equivalent EU standard of data protection.By using Medium Services, you authorize Medium to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where Medium operates. Where your data is disclosed to Medium’s processors, it is subject by contract to at least the same level of data protection as that set forth under [https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9](https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9).
    
    With our Social Media pages, we can communicate with you and provide you with interesting information. We may receive further data from you through your comments, shared images, messages and reactions, which are then processed to answer or communicate with you. If you use Social Media on several end devices, a cross-device analysis of the data can take place.
    
    Data processing takes place with your consent or for the purpose of answering your enquiry or on the basis of legitimate interests in improving the services, advertising and marketing activities and presentation to the outside world (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR).

    We will transfer your personal data to a third party only (i) within the scope of legal provisions, i.e. if we are obliged to transfer the data due to a government or court order, or, (ii) if applicable, legal provisions authorize the transfer, e.g. if the transfer is required to pursue our legitimate interests or to fulfil a contract, for example in case of mergers and acquisitions, (iii) or if you give your explicit consent.

However, such profiling or automated decision making may happen by third party providers through the Website or Service. We will inform you about such fact if possible.
    
    Profiling means any automated processing of personal data consisting in the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to the performance of work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or relocation of that natural person. Examples of such profiling include the analysis of data (e.g. based on statistical methods) with the aim of displaying personalized advertising to the user or giving shopping tips. The data subject shall not be subject to a decision based exclusively on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effect against him or significantly affects him or her in a similar manner.

    -----------
    
    **As a data subject you have the right:**
    
    * (where we are relying on your consent) to withdraw your consent to us at any time. As a result, we are no longer allowed to continue the processing of data based on this consent in the future;

    * to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data, if e.g. the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you refuse its deletion and we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or you have filed an objection against the processing; and
    * to receive your personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, current and machine-readable format or to request the transmission to another controller.

10. Duration of Storing your Data; Data Security; Access and Changes to this Privacy policy; Contact Details
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    ### Duration of Storing your Data
    
    As a rule, we only store your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the execution of the contract or the respective purpose and limit the storage period to an absolutely necessary minimum. Your IP-address and server-log-files are stored for seven (7) days for security and technical reasons while an hashed version of your combined IP address and user agent is retained for one (1) year (as set forth above).
    
    In the case of long-term contractual relationships, such as the use of our Service, these storage periods may vary, but are generally limited to the duration of the contractual relationship or, with regard to the inventory data, to the maximum legal retention periods, e.g. in accordance with the German Commercial Code _(Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB)_ and the Tax Code _(Abgabenordnung, AO)_
    
    Criteria for the storage period include whether the data are still up-to-date, whether the contractual relationship with us still exists, whether an inquiry has already been processed, whether a process has been completed or not, and whether legal retention periods for the personal data concerned are relevant or not.
    
    ### Data Security
    
    We have installed technical and organizational measures in order to safeguard our Website and/or Service against loss, destruction, access, changes or the distribution of your data by unauthorized persons.
    
    The Website and Service is operated through a safe SSL-connection. If an SSL-connection is activated third parties are prevented from reading any data that are transferred by you to us.
    
    We store Personal Information in encrypted format, leveraging state-of-the-art encryption algorithms. Gitpod is hosted inside Google’s and Amazon's secure and compliant data centres, for more information please visit [https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance) or [https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/resources/](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/resources/).
    
    We also maintain an Information Security & Privacy program with established policies and procedures that govern the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.
