**California Notice at Collection**: See the [State Privacy Rights Notice below](#state-privacy-rights-notice) for important information about your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act.

### Personal information we collect

**Information you provide to us**. Personal information you may provide to us through the Services includes:

* **Contact data**, such as your first and last name, salutation, email address, billing and mailing addresses, and phone number.
    
* **Profile data**, such as the username and password that you may set to establish an online account on the Site, and any other information that you add to your account profile.
    
* **Pregnancy-related data**, such as due date and pregnancy status (whether you are trying, not trying, expecting or just had a baby).
    
* **Communications data**, based on our exchanges with you, including when you contact us through the Site, social media, or otherwise.
    
* **Transactional data**, such as information relating to or needed to complete your orders on or through the Site, including order numbers and transaction history.
    
* **Marketing data**, such as your preferences for receiving our marketing communications and details about your engagement with them.
    
* **Payment data** needed to complete transactions, including payment card information or bank account number.
    
* **Promotion data**, including information you share when you enter a competition, promotion, or complete a survey. Please note that if you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or giveaway through the Service, we may ask you for your contact data to notify you if you win, to verify your identity, and/or to send you prizes. In some situations, we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules and other relevant information for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.
    

**Third-party sources**. We may combine personal information we receive from you with personal information we obtain from other sources, such as:

* **Public sources**, such as government agencies, public records, social media platforms, and other publicly available sources.
    
* **Private sources**, such as data providers, social media platforms, and data licensors.
    
* **Our affiliate partners**, such as our affiliate network provider and publishers, influencers, and promoters who participate in our paid affiliate programs.
    
* **Marketing partners**, such as joint marketing partners and event co-sponsors.
    
* **Third-party services** (such as Apple or Google) that you use to log into, or otherwise link to, your Ritual account. This data may include your username, profile picture, and other information associated with your account on that third-party service that is made available to us based on your account settings on that service.
    

**Automatic data collection**. We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Site, our communications, and other online services, such as:

* **Device data**, such as your computer or mobile device's operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.
    
* **Online activity data**, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing to the Site, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times and duration of access, and whether you have opened our emails or clicked links within them.
    

**Cookies and similar technologies**. Some of our automatic data collection is facilitated by the following technologies.

* **Cookies**, which are small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers to record users' web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both "session cookies" that are deleted when a session ends, "persistent cookies" that remain longer, "first party" cookies that we place (used to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites and to store certain information from your current session to deliver a more personalized shopping experience) and "third party" cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place.
    
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
    
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.
    
* **Session-replay technologies**, such as those provided by FullStory, that employ software code to record users' interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch and analyze visual reconstructions of those user sessions. The replays may include users' clicks, mobile app touches, mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. You can learn more about FullStory at [https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy) and you can opt-out of session recording by FullStory at [https://www.fullstory.com/optout/](https://www.fullstory.com/optout/).
    
* **Chat technologies**, such as those provided by Intercom, that employ cookies and software code to operate the chat features that you can use to communicate with us through the Service. We and such third-party providers may access and use information about webpages visited on our website, your IP address, your general geographic information (e.g., city, state), and other personal information you share through online chats for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
    

For more information, see our [Cookie Notice](https://ritual.com/cookie-notice). We will store a record of your preferences with respect to the use of those technologies in connection with the Site.

**Data about others**. We may offer features that help users invite their friends or contacts to use the Service, and we may collect contact details about these invitees so we can deliver their invitations. Please do not refer someone to us or share their contact details with us unless you have their permission to do so.

**Legal bases for processing**. In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your personal information, the UK GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a "legal basis" for that use. Our legal bases for processing your personal information described in this Privacy Policy are listed below.

* Where we need to perform a contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you ("**Contractual Necessity**").

More detail about the specific legitimate interests pursued in respect of each purpose we use your personal information for is set out in the list below.
    
* Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation ("**Compliance with Law**").
    
* Where we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the purpose in question ("**Consent**").
    

In addition, for any special categories of personal data we process (e.g., data related to your health, such as pregnancy-related data), we also have to establish a condition to processing such data, because it is considered to be more sensitive in nature – for example, we may look to obtain your explicit consent to the Processing of those special categories of personal data for one or more specified purposes ("**Explicit Consent**").

We have set out below, in a list format, the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant Purposes for which we use your personal information – for more information on these Purposes, what they cover, and the data types involved, see How we use your personal information.

**Purpose: Data sharing in the context of corporate events**

* Legitimate interest. We and any relevant third parties have a legitimate interest in providing information to relevant third parties who are involved in an actual or prospective corporate event (including to enable them to investigate – and, where relevant, to continue to operate – all or relevant part(s) of our operations). However, we would always look to take steps to minimize the amount and sensitivity of any personal information shared in these contexts where possible and appropriate.
    

**Purpose: Compliance with law and co-operation with authorities**

**Purpose: To create aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data**

* Legitimate interest. We have legitimate interest, and believe it is also in your interests, that we are able to take steps to ensure that our Services and how we use Personal Information is as un-privacy intrusive as possible.
    

**Purpose: Further uses**

* The original legal basis relied upon, if the relevant further use is compatible with the initial purpose for which the Personal Information was collected.
    
* Consent, if the relevant further use is not compatible with the initial purpose for which the personal information was collected.
    

**Special Categories of Personal Data**. As noted above, you may choose to provide us with your pregnancy-related data. We will only collect such data where you have provided us with your explicit consent to its use for the specific purpose of personalizing your experience. If you do not want us to process your pregnancy-status data, you can always choose not to do so by selecting 'Prefer not to say'.

We will not use your personal information (whether it is directly special category personal data or not) to create inferences or to otherwise reveal information concerning your health / health conditions, your genetic information, your racial or ethnic origin, your sex life or sexual orientation or any other special category(ies) of personal data without your explicit consent. If you do not provide your explicit consent, we will not carry out any Processing that is designed or intended to treat you differently on the basis of a possible inference or 'educated guess' that we could theoretically make about, or that could deduce, these types of special categories (e.g., from your purchase history).

**Retention**

We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**Your rights**

The UK GDPR gives you certain rights regarding your personal information in certain circumstances. If you are located in the UK, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

* **Access**. Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.
    
* **Correct**. Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.
    
* **Delete**. Delete your personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it – you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
    
* **Transfer**. Transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice.
    
* **Restrict**. Restrict the processing of your personal information, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
    
* **Object**. Object to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on Legitimate Interests – you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
    
* **Opt-out**. Stop sending you direct marketing communications. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.
    
* **Consent withdrawal**. Where we rely on your consent and/or explicit consent to process your personal information you may withdraw that consent at any time.
    

You may submit these requests online using our [privacy request form](https://preferences.ritual.com/privacy), or by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://ritual.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request.

Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions. If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or our response to your requests regarding your personal information, you may contact us or submit a complaint to the UK data protection regulator:

The Information Commissioner's Office

Water Lane, Wycliffe House

Wilmslow - Cheshire SK9 5AF

Tel. +44 303 123 1113

**Data transfers outside the UK**.

We are a U.S.-based company and many of our service providers, advisers, partners or other recipients of data are also based in the U.S. This means that, if you use the Service, your personal data will necessarily be accessed and processed in the U.S. It may also be provided to recipients in other countries outside the UK.

It is important to note that that the U.S. is not the subject of an 'adequacy decision' under the UK GDPR – basically, this means that the U.S. legal regime is not considered by the UK government to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, which is equivalent to that provided by relevant UK laws.

Where we share your personal data with third parties who are based outside the UK, we try to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by making sure one of the following mechanisms is implemented:

* **Transfers to territories with an adequacy decision**. We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the UK Government (from time to time).
    
* **Transfers to territories without an adequacy decision**.
    
* We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have **not** been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the UK Government (e.g., the U.S., see above).
    
* However, in these cases:
    
* we may use specific appropriate safeguards approved by the UK Information Commissioner's Office or UK Government, which are designed to give personal information the same protection it has in the UK – for example, requiring the recipient of personal information to enter into the relevant form of the so-called 'International Data Transfer Agreement' issued or approved from time to time; or
    
* in limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or 'derogation', which permits us to transfer your information to such country despite the absence of an 'adequacy decision' or 'appropriate safeguards' – for example, reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer.
    

You may contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the UK.

### Notice to Canadian residents

If you are a resident of Canada, this section applies to you. You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, and to have information that is inaccurate or incomplete updated. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and your right to access, and to provide you with the personal information that we hold about you. Applicable law may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with access to some or all of the personal information that we hold about you, or we may have destroyed, erased, or made your personal information anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices. If we cannot provide you with access to your personal information, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Under some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent.
