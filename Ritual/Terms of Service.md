PRODUCTS CAN ONLY BE RESOLD IF YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE RESELLER AGREEMENT WITH US, INCLUDING AN AGREEMENT TO SELL IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR AUTHORIZED RESELLER POLICY, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES RESELLERS TO ABIDE BY CERTAIN QUALITY CONTROLS WITH RESPECT TO THE RESALE OF PRODUCTS. IF YOU WISH TO BECOME AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER, PLEASE CONTACT [\[email protected\]](https://ritual.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Certain Products available on our Site may be available exclusively online through the Site, and may be limited in quantity. Descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, prices, and availability of any Products are subject to change without notice, and our current prices can be found on the Site. We make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our Products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any Products on the Site at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any item purchased through the Site. By placing an order, you represent that the Products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner. We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any Product; to honor, cancel or impose conditions or limitations on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code, referral credit or other similar promotions; to bar any user from making any or all purchases; and to refuse to provide any user with any Product. All descriptions of Products or Product pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for any Product made on this Site is void where prohibited.

Each part of any order that you submit to Ritual constitutes an offer to purchase. If you do not receive a message from Ritual confirming receipt of your order, please contact our Customer Service department at [\[email protected\]](https://ritual.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) before re-entering your order. Ritual’s confirmation of receipt of your order does not constitute Ritual’s acceptance of your order. Ritual is only deemed to have accepted your order once the Product(s) you ordered have been shipped.

Although we strive to accept all valid orders, Ritual reserves the right to deny any order for any reason, including if: (i) we discover an error in pricing and/or other information about the Product or receive insufficient or erroneous billing, payment, and/or shipping information, (ii) we suspect an order has been placed using stolen payment information or otherwise appears to be connected to fraud, or (iii) the ordered Product is unavailable due to discontinuance or otherwise. We may also refuse any order that is connected with a previous payment dispute.

If any Product is discontinued or otherwise becomes unavailable, Ritual reserves the right to cancel your order and provide you a refund for the amount paid for the Product.

To protect the intellectual property rights of Ritual, any resale of Products for personal and/or business profit is strictly prohibited. Ritual reserves the right to decline any order that we deem to possess characteristics of reselling.

### **SUBSCRIPTION PROCESS, RENEWAL AND CANCELLATION**

We currently ship to addresses within the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. If you purchase a subscription to Products through our Site or in our retail stores, we will send you a shipment containing a supply of such Products from us for that specific subscription period. We may offer different subscription terms and/or options to delay or rush your next shipment for your convenience.

Your subscription will continue, and you will be charged, at the beginning of each subscription period, until you choose to cancel. However, please note that all fees for the Products are non-refundable, so if you cancel your subscription, we will send you any outstanding supply of Products but will not refund you any amounts for shipments not received as of the date of cancellation. There is no subscription fee associated with your subscription. You will only be charged for the cost of the product and the cost of shipping and handling. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional subscription period, at our then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at any time prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going to the “Edit Subscription” section in the “Account” page.

If you do not wish your account to renew automatically, or if you want to cancel your subscription, please log in and go to the “Account” page. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your payment provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. We will send you an email reminder prior to charging your payment provider each subscription period. If you choose to cancel your subscription at any time, your subscription will terminate automatically and we will not charge your payment provider for the subsequent subscription period. You agree that we may either terminate or suspend your subscription for any reason at any time in our sole discretion.

If you are a consumer in the United Kingdom, prices in connection with the Products or Services provided under this Agreement shall be inclusive of any applicable Sales Tax. In all other cases, the payments required under this Section of this Agreement do not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the Products or Services provided under this Agreement. If Ritual determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement, Ritual shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under this Section of this Agreement. If any Products or Services, or payments for any Products or Services, under the Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Ritual, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Ritual for any liability or expense Ritual may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Ritual's request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, "Sales Tax" shall mean any sales or use tax, VAT and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

### **BILLING AND PAYMENTS**

To make an order through the Services, you must provide valid payment information. By providing your payment information, you agree that Ritual is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to Ritual hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify Ritual of any change in your billing address, debit card, credit card, or other relevant payment account information. In all countries we currently ship products to, we accept the following debit or credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Additionally, we accept Ritual gift cards in all countries we currently ship products to (“Gift Cards”). If you purchase or use any Ritual gift cards, you agree to the terms of the Ritual Gift Card Terms and Conditions, which are outlined below (the “Gift Card Terms”). If you do not agree to the Ritual Gift Card Terms and Conditions, you may not use or purchase Gift Cards. We may, in our sole discretion, create discounts and promotional codes that may be redeemed for credit in your account, or other features or benefits, subject to any additional terms that we establish on a per promotional code basis (“Promo Codes”). Promo Codes may only be used once per person. Only Promo Codes sent to you through official Ritual communications channels are valid. You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by us; (iii) may be disabled by us at any time for any reason without liability to us; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that we establish for such Promo Code; (v) are not redeemable for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use.

You may be charged local tax, if applicable. If your payment method is declined, we will attempt to process your charge until the transaction is approved. If we are unable to complete the transaction, we may contact you directly to update your account information.

We use a third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services). You hereby consent to provide and authorize Natals, Inc. and its third-party service provider to share any information and payment instructions you provide to the extent required to complete payment transactions in accordance with this Agreement, including personal, financial, credit card payment, and transaction information. Upon initial registration of your credit card, you may see a pending charge as part of the authorization confirmation process. This is not a charge and is used to confirm account authenticity. The pending charge should automatically clear on its own. If you have any issues, please contact [\[email protected\]](https://ritual.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We are not responsible for any fees or charges that your bank or credit card issuer may apply.

The risk of loss and title for items purchased by you passes to you upon our delivery of the items to the carrier; provided, however, that if the carrier fails to deliver your purchased items within thirty (30) days of the specified delivery date, you may cancel and request a refund.

### **RETURNS**

Products may be returned in accordance with our Return Policy, which can be found here: [https://ritual.com/return-policy](https://ritual.com/return-policy).

We do not honor this Return Policy for Products purchased from any unauthorized reseller.

To request a refund, please contact us at: [\[email protected\]](https://ritual.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Refunds will be issued by us in our sole discretion. Any refund will be issued to the same payment method used for the relevant purchase.

### **GIFT CARDS**

The Gift Card Terms describe the terms and conditions that apply to your purchase and use of Gift Cards. By purchasing, accepting and/or using your Gift Card, you agree to be bound by these Gift Card Terms. If you do not agree with the Gift Card Terms, please do not purchase, accept or use a Gift Card. These Gift Card Terms are subject to and governed by this Agreement, and considered “Supplemental Terms” as defined herein.

Ritual Gift Cards are issued and sold by Natals, Inc. Gift Cards can be purchased online at [https://ritual.com](https://ritual.com/) for any value up to five hundred USD ($500), CAD (CA$500) or GBP (£500). To purchase a Gift Card, you must define an amount, recipient and recipient e-mail address, and you may select the date on which the Gift Card will be emailed to the specified recipient (this may be you). The recipient may be outside of the countries we ship to, but please note that shipping of Ritual products is only supported within the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom at this time.

When purchasing a Gift Card, you must provide your billing information at check-out. Gift Card purchases are final and non-refundable.

Purchases made with your Gift Card will be deducted from your Gift Card Balance. You can keep track of and view your unused Gift Card Balance in your ritual.com account balance (“Account Balance”) and such Gift Card funds can be applied to a future purchase without entering any additional payment information; provided, however, if a purchase exceeds your Gift Card Balance, you must pay the remaining amount with any payment method accepted on our Site.

Gift Cards do not expire or decrease in value if you do not use them, and they are not subject to inactivity or maintenance fees.

Gift Cards may only be used to purchase eligible goods provided by Ritual, and may not be used towards the purchase of another Gift Card. Credits issued for loyalty, rewards, goodwill or promotional or similar purposes (“Promotional Credit”) are not Gift Cards and a Gift Card may not be purchased with Promotional Credit. Gift Cards may not be reloaded, resold, or used for payment outside of the Site or the Ritual physical retail stores; used for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other promotional purposes; redeemed for more than face value; transferred for value; redeemed for cash (except to the extent required by law); or returned for a cash refund (except to the extent required by law). No portion of your Account Balance may be transferred to another ritual.com account.

We are not responsible for any stolen Gift Card Balance or use by someone other than yourself or the intended recipient. Title to and risk of loss for Gift Cards pass to the purchaser upon sale. If you suspect someone has copied or stolen your Gift Card Balance, contact Ritual at [\[email protected\]](https://ritual.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) immediately. Ritual reserves the right to refuse to accept Gift Cards that are suspected or believed to have been obtained fraudulently.

By using a Gift Card, you also agree not to use a Gift Card in any manner that is misleading, deceptive, unfair, or otherwise harmful to Ritual or its customers. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right, without notice to you, to void Gift Cards without a refund, suspend or terminate customer accounts or the ability to use our services, cancel or limit orders, and bill alternative forms of payment if we suspect that a Gift Card is obtained, used, or applied to a ritual.com account (or your Account Balance applied to a purchase) fraudulently, unlawfully, or otherwise in violation of this Agreement.

TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, RITUAL MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CARDS OR YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

These Gift Card Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to choice of law provisions. Any dispute related to Gift Cards shall be handled in accordance with the “Arbitration Agreement” section of this Agreement.

We reserve the right to change these Gift Card Terms without notice, from time to time at our sole discretion. All Gift Card Terms are applicable to the extent permitted by law. If any of these terms and conditions are deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that unenforceable term will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining terms and conditions. Ritual may also issue Promotional Credit. Promotional Credit is not subject to these Gift Card Terms and may be subject to an expiration date and other conditions, as specified on the Promotional Credit or in related promotional materials.

### **ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**

Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with us and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

1. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, to any Products sold or distributed through the Site, or to any aspect of your relationship with us, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or we may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes, claims or requests that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.
    
2. Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Incorporating Services, Ltd., 3500 S Dupont Hwy, Dover, Delaware 19901, with a copy to Natals, Inc. (dba Ritual), 1370 N St Andrews Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90028. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/); all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/). JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, we will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
    

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

1. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
    
2. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND NATALS, INC. HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all disputes, claims or requests shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in 1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
    
3. Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the Federal or state courts of Los Angeles, California. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.
    
4. 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Natals, Inc. (dba Ritual), 1370 N St Andrews Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90028 or at [\[email protected\]](https://ritual.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
    
5. Severability. Except as provided in 5 above, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
    
6. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.
    
7. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Company at the following address: Natals, Inc. (dba Ritual), 1370 N St Andrews Pl, Los Angeles, CA 90028.
    
8. Alternatives to Arbitration. If you are a resident of a jurisdiction that prohibits arbitration agreements or class action waivers in consumer contracts and this Agreement is deemed to be a consumer contract, the portions of this Agreement related to arbitration will not apply to you. Instead, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any claim will be the state and federal courts located in the State of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. If you are a resident of a jurisdiction that prohibits the application of California law in a consumer contract, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of your jurisdiction of residence and the non-exclusive venue of any claim will be in the courts of your jurisdiction of residence.
