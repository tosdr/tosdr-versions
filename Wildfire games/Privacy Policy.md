| [1](#L1) | \[font="sans-bold-18"\]0 A.D. Empires Ascendant UserReporter Terms and Conditions\[/font\] |
| [2](#L2) |     |
| [3](#L3) | \[font="sans-bold-14"\]Document Date:\[/font\] 2023-08-17 |
| [4](#L4) |     |
| [5](#L5) | The 0 A.D. UserReporter is a tool that allows you, the 0 A.D. player, to automatically upload hardware- and software-system details in order to help Wildfire Games and community developers to improve the performance and compatibility of 0 A.D. |
| [6](#L6) |     |
| [7](#L7) | \[font="sans-bold-14"\]Purpose of the UserReport:\[/font\] |
| [8](#L8) | The UserReports indicate which system features (for example CPU instruction sets and OpenGL capabilities) are widely supported by the computer systems of 0 A.D. players. |
| [9](#L9) | This allows developers to decide which 0 A.D. program code is safe to use and which optimizations are most feasible to implement next. |
| [10](#L10) | If the UserReporter is enabled, the UserReport containing that information is uploaded to Wildfire Games once per program launch (GDPR 13.1.c, GDPR 15.1.a). |
| [11](#L11) |     |
| [12](#L12) | \[font="sans-bold-14"\]UserReport data:\[/font\] |
| [13](#L13) | 1\. Hardware Details, for example the screen size, CPU clock rate, memory capacity and the sound card manufacturer. |
| [14](#L14) | 2\. System Software Details, for example the operating system version, graphics driver version, OpenGL capabilities. |
| [15](#L15) | 3\. Application Details, for example the 0 A.D. version and build number. |
| [16](#L16) | 4\. The UserID. This is a pseudonym generated by the UserReporter the first time it is used (GDPR 4.5, GDPR 25.1, GDPR 32.1.a). |
| [17](#L17) | The UserID enables developers to count how many 0 A.D. players use a specific set of hardware or system software without allowing them to attribute the data to any person. |
| [18](#L18) | 5\. The date of the upload of the UserReport. This allows focus on recent UserReports and disregard old reports. |
| [19](#L19) |     |
| [20](#L20) | The UserReport does not include any specially protected categories of personal data (GDPR 9, GDPR 10). |
| [21](#L21) | The transmission is secured with SSL. Data is protected against unintentional loss in encrypted backups for additional time (GDPR 30.1.g, GDPR 32). |
| [22](#L22) |     |
