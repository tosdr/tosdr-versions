 **We collect information from and about you. Below is additional information regarding what data is collected, stored and processed.**

  

Data Collection. The information we learn from customers and those who interact with our Sites helps us personalize and continually improve your Shane Co. experience. Here are the types of information we gather:

Information You Submit to Shane Co. We receive and store any information you enter on our Sites or give us in any other way. Types of information that you may submit, and we do (or may) collect include: 

* Contact Information. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. For example, we collect your name and email address if you register on our Sites. We might collect your phone number or zip code. We might also collect your mailing address, as well as other information regarding how best to get in touch or interact with you on your desired terms.

* Payment Information. For example, we may collect your credit card number if you make a layaway order from Shaneco.com. We may also collect your credit card number or bank information for other purchases or subscriptions. This information is deleted after a purchase is made, or as soon as may be practicable under the circumstances should aspects of your order remain open or unfulfilled.

* Information You Submit or Post. We collect the information you post in a public space on our Sites. We also collect information when you contact us, including information derived from your interactive engagement with our Sites.

* Demographic Information. We may collect information like your gender and age. We might collect this when you contact us or enter a promotion, sweepstakes or contest, or when you make a purchase from Shaneco.com.

* Content Related Information. When uploading pictures, data, or other information, a name, email address and other identifying information may be required. Generally, the information collected helps us to communicate with you regarding content that you have submitted. For instance, we may use your email address to notify you of the status of the content you have submitted.

* Social Media and Third-Party Information. We may allow Customers to share our products and services on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, or other social media sites. If you decide to share one of our products or services, we will get basic information from your social media profile like name, gender, profile photo, and friends or contacts. This information is collected by the social media company and is provided to us under the terms of its own privacy policies. You may be able to control the information that we receive from Facebook using the privacy settings in one’s Facebook account. 

Automatically Collected Information. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses shaneco.com or advertisements. We may collect information about the browser you're using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. We may also look at clickstream data. We may combine this information with other information we collect from you. This includes anything we collect from third parties. If you use our mobile website, we may collect your GPS location and your unique device identifier.

Device Identifiable Information. We may collect information that does not identify you personally, but is linked to your computer or device ("Device Identifiable Information”). We collect Device Identifiable Information from you in the normal course of operating our Sites. When you visit our Sites to browse, read or download information, we automatically collect information about your computer that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, pages visited, and referring website addresses. We may use Device Identifiable Information we collect to analyze trends, help administer the Sites, track the movement of visitors, to learn about and determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Sites, how visitors navigate throughout the Sites or the Service and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

We may also collect Device Identifiable Information through "cookies” or "web beacons” as explained below.

We may also collect information about your mobile device such as the type and model, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari), applications using our Sites, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID.

We may also collect your location information, such as your zip code or the approximate geographic area provided by your Internet service provider (ISP) or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device when location services have been enabled.

We get information about you from third parties. For example, contracts, representatives, affiliates, and social media platforms or plugins may also give us information about you. Affiliates or other business partners may also give us information. This might include information they gathered passively. We may also engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these data provider cookies, please go to [http://www.aboutads.info/choices.](http://www.aboutads.info/choices%E2%80%9D%20rel=)

Advertising or Targeting Related. We may use first-party or third-party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Sites or on third-party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement. If you would like to opt-out of the Technologies we employ on our Sites, services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.

**2. We collect personal data in different ways.**

We collect information directly from you. We receive and store any information you enter on our Sites or give to us in any other way, such as described above. Most of our data is collected directly from Customers themselves. For example, we collect information you choose to provide us when you sign up for our emails or texts alerts, when you use our website, including Shane Co. MyWay, and when you make purchases from us either online or in person. We also collect information if you contact us, such as contact request forms and mailing list subscription forms. We collect information about you through our Sites and retail points of contact. In addition, personal data can be collected through direct contact and collaboration activities, such as face-to-face online meetings, visits in stores, phone calls and direct email, chat or text communications.

We collect information from you passively. On our platforms, which include our Sites, we collect information passively and/or automatically (such as when a site is visited), or via cookies or other tracking technologies. We might also collect information passively in our emails or through our apps. We may also collect information passively in connection with third parties. For example, to get purchase information from Affiliates, we may gather information passively on their platforms. Tools we use include browser cookies and web beacons.

In addition, with your permission, data may be collected in other ways within the marketing context. Personal data may also be updated or supplemented by collecting data from other private and public sources.

**3.  Information regarding the retention, disclosure and transfer of personal data.**

**Retention of Personal Data**.

Personal data shall be retained as long as needed for the purposes defined in this Notice and as required by the law, unless such data is replaced through regular updates or otherwise. Note that the periods vary greatly from one type of processing to another.

We retain personal data only for a period that is necessary to achieve the purposes for which personal data is processed, unless there is a legal obligation to retain personal data for a longer period of time (for example, responsibilities and obligations under specific legislation, accounting or reporting obligations). We may retain information for a longer period of time if it is required, for example, to exercise a legal claim, to defend a legal claim, or to settle a similar dispute. In general, we observe the following criteria for retaining and deleting personal data: 

* In relation to the personal data of our customers, and except as otherwise provided, personal data is stored for the duration needed to service the Customer. Because we consider Customer relationships to be for life, and offer lifetime warranty on many of our products, we require a record or Customer profile info complete with various information. As such, we may store some of the personal data for a longer period of time or indefinitely if necessary in order to fulfil our legitimate interest, such as servicing lifetime warranties, and also in managing and defending legal claims or to comply with our legal obligations.
* In relation to the security of our services and preventing abuses, personal data is processed for the duration of the investigation of abuses or other harmful user experiences. In addition to this, however, we may store the necessary personal data for a longer period where it is necessary in relation to managing and defending a legal claim or to comply with legal obligations.
* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, personal data may also be stored for as long as a certain legal obligation requires. 

We evaluate the necessity and accuracy of personal data on a regular basis and endeavor to ensure that the incorrect and unnecessary personal data are corrected or deleted. Detailed retention times can be provided upon requests.

  

**Disclosures, Transfers and Recipients of Personal Data.**

  

For the purposes stated in this Notice, the personal data may be disclosed, when necessary, to authorities, among and to other companies within the same group of companies as us (subsidiaries and affiliates), and to selected third parties, such as third-party service providers. In such case, the personal data will only be disclosed for purposes defined above and any disclosure is always limited to only the strictly necessary personal data included in such purposes. We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal data to third parties outside Shane Co. for such third parties’ own purposes without Customer’s consent.

In addition, we may share the personal data in connection with any merger, sale of our assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business and in connection with other similar arrangements.

The personal data is also disclosed to third parties if required under any applicable law or regulation or order by competent authorities, and to investigate possible infringing use of the products and services as well as to guarantee the safety and usability of the products and services. In the event of emergencies or other unexpected circumstances, we may be required to disclose the personal data of registered persons to protect human life, health and property. If a government authority requests information and we evaluate that such disclosure is required and appropriate to comply with laws, regulations, or a legal process and to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Shane Co., Customers or the public, we may disclose required information.

**4. Cookie Policy for United States residents and those subject to the GDPR.**

This Cookie Policy specifically explains how we use cookies. We describe what information we gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store cookies. It also informs you how you can prevent and block these cookies from being stored. Note that this section is narrower in scope than the entirety of our Notice of which it is a part.

**What are “cookies”, “pixels”, “widgets” and “analytics”?**

Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device (_persistent cookie_) or stored in memory (_session cookie_) to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features, such as Shane Co. MyWay, personalized advertisements on other websites, and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. They are generated by a web page server, which is essentially a computer that operates a website. Information the cookie contains is set by the server and it can be used by that server whenever a user visits the Sites.

Cookies can be stored for varying lengths of time on your browser or device. Session cookies are deleted from your computer or device when you close your web-browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer or device until deleted or until they reach their expiry date which varies typically from a few days up to a couple of years.

Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as “_first party cookies_”), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on our website (“_third party cookies_”).

Our sites, emails, and other items may also contain other tracking technologies such as “_web beacons_” or “_pixels_.” These are typically transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email, which indicate that a page or email has been viewed.

The cookies we are using are gathered through various service providers. Our Sites may also include cookies, or similar technologies from third party service providers. These third-party cookie providers will also be able to gather and use data collected by their cookies. We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these third-party cookies. For further information about cookie usage by our third-party providers, please check the provider’s applicable cookie and privacy policies.

The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of ShaneCo.com’s essential features, you may want to leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any ShaneCo.com products and services that require you to Sign in.

“Pixels”/“Web Beacons” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).

“Social Media Widgets” such as the Facebook “Like” button and those for LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and other similar outlets (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive miniprograms) may be on our Sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy Notice of the company providing it.

We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop website content. This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites. You can opt out of Google’s collection and Processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

**What purposes do we use cookies and similar technologies for? What information is collected?**

Generally, we use cookies and other tracking technologies to make visiting our website easier and to improve general user experience. In addition, we use cookies and collect information that helps us to enhance your experience and our services, as well as assist with advertising. The cookies that we use allow our website to work, to analyze our website traffic, and to help us to understand how our website is used so we can optimize it. To serve these purposes, we use cookies and web beacons to collect:

 * The user's IP address;

* Time expended;

* Pages visited;

* Browser type;

* The web address from which the user landed to the website;

* The server from which the user landed to the website;

* The domain name from which the user landed to the website;

* Social media sharing information; and

* Openings and clicks of emails. 

**What types of cookies do we use? What categories do the different uses and cookies fall into?**

This section details what kind of first- and third-party cookies you may encounter on our Sites. More specifically, our uses of such technologies fall into the following general categories:

Operationally Necessary. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Sites, services, applications, and tools. For instance, to provide you with better experience on this website we provide the functionality to set your preferences for how this website runs when you use it. To remember your preferences, we need to set cookies so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a page that is affected by your preferences. This also includes technologies that allow you access to our Sites, services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security, or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions.

5. We use information as disclosed and described here.

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below.

**We use information to respond to your requests or questions.** For example, we might use your information to respond to your customer feedback.

We use information to improve our products and services. We may use your information to make our Sites better. We might use your information to customize your experience with us or understand your preferences. We may combine information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties.

We use information to communicate with you. We may send you emails and text messages you have consented to receive, such as promotional messages and transactional messages.

If you have opted-in to receiving messages from us, you expressly acknowledge consent to receiving such messages to the email, phone number, and address you have provided us, and that such messages may be from an automated system. If you have opted-in to receive text messages we do not charge you for the text message, provided, however, that standard messaging and data rates will apply to each text message in accordance with your wireless plan and your carrier’s policies. We do not require you to agree to receive text messages as a condition of making any purchase. If you need help with text messages text HELP to 720-730-2009. Text messages may not be delivered to you due to factors beyond our control such as transmission range, your carrier’s policies, or your phone plan.

You have the choice to opt-in to or opt-out from receiving certain emails or text messages to the email address or mobile number you provide to us at any time. Please see below for ways to opt-out of receiving certain communication from us.

Any communication or material you transmit to us by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary. Except to the extent expressly covered by this Notice, anything you transmit or post may be used by us for any purpose, including but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast and posting. Furthermore, you expressly agree that we are free to use any ideas, concepts, knowhow, or techniques contained in any communication you send to us without compensation and for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services using such information.

Automated Decision-Making and Profiling. Profiling means the automated processing of personal data for evaluating the personal aspects of an individual. In particular, profiling refers to the analysis or prediction of aspects concerning the Customer’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behavior, location or movements. Profiling is automated or partly automated, is performed on personal data and evaluates personal aspects.

  

Decision-making is automated when decisions are based solely on the automated processing of personal data and the decisions produce legal effects concerning the Customer or significantly affect him or her. The processing in question includes profiling as defined in the GDPR insofar as it produces legal effects concerning the Customer or affects him or her in a correspondingly significant way. Automated decision-making is possible without profiling and vice versa. However, a single processing activity can involve both, depending on factors such as the data being used. We may use automated decision-making or profiling pursuant to Article 22 GDPR.

**6. We Engage in Interest-Based Advertising.**

ShaneCo.com and our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms. This might include apps.

Interest-based advertising includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities. For example, providing you with promotional materials we think you would like based on your shopping activity. These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or other companies’ products.

To decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others.

We work with third parties who might help gather this information or with whom we might share your information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online, or online usage information.

The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. If you want to opt out, visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices.](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) Your opt-out may be both browser and device specific.

**7. We Use Various Tracking Technologies.**

We–or third parties we work with–use several common data collection technologies including cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies. We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We do this for many reasons, including the following: 

 * To engage in interest-based advertising as discussed above.

* To understand the activities and behaviors of customers and platform users.

* To recognize new visitors to our Sites.

* To recognize past customers.

* To present more personalized content and offers, to improve your website experience, optimize your shopping experience, and provide Site and service enhancements. For example, to avoid repeatedly showing you the same advertisements.

* To serve customized advertising (whether on our website or others you visit).

* To better understand our audience, our customers, our Site visitors, and their respective interests. For example, to understand what ads are of interest to consumers. 

We work with third parties who provide us with certain web search services.

We use information for security purposes. We may use information to protect our company, our customers, and our Sites.

We use information for marketing purposes. If you register with our Site or if you opt-in to receiving messages from us in any other way, we may send you information about special offers, new products, or new services. These might be third party offers or products we think you might find interesting. Depending on your choice we may send this type of information via email, text, call, push notifications in apps, or notifications by regular mail. We also use information to customize offers you receive. This includes using your shopping history on Affiliates or other third-party platforms.

We utilize Third-Party service providers, and use your information to perform those functions. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

We use information to communicate with you about your account or our relationship. We may contact you about your account or feedback. We might also contact you about this Notice or our website Terms.

We use information as otherwise permitted by law.

**8. We may share information with third parties.**

**We will share information within the Shane Co. family of companies.**

We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we share information with vendors who send emails on our behalf. We may also share information with companies that operate our websites or run a promotion.

We will share information with our business partners. This includes sharing for marketing or advertising or for purposes of running joint promotions. For example, we will share information with our Affiliates to process orders or understand preferences. Or we might share information that third parties can use to serve you with ads they think you will like. This could include sharing with our partners what ads you look at. Third parties may use information for their own marketing or advertising purposes.

We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ShaneCo.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Notice.

We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any preexisting Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Shane Co., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

**We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you.**

  

**9. You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices.**

You can choose not to provide us with information. You can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such ShaneCo.com features as Your Account, Shane Co. MyWay, and Customer Reviews.

General Opt-In. Subject to state-specific and rights under the GDPR, if you have opted-in to receiving messages from us, you expressly acknowledge consent to receiving such messages to the email, phone number, and address you have provided us, and that such messages may be from an automated system.

  

Additional. Any communication or material you transmit to us by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary. Except to the extent expressly covered by this Notice, anything you transmit or post may be used by us for any purpose, including but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast and posting. Furthermore, you expressly agree that we are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to us without compensation and for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, content, manufacturing and marketing products and services using such information.

You can opt out of receiving our marketing email and texts. To stop receiving our promotional emails or other messages, you may opt-out by one of the following methods:

 * Selecting the "Unsubscribe" link in any promotional email

* Logging into your ShaneCo.com account and changing your email preference under the Shane Co. MyWay section [https://www.shaneco.com/my-account/myway.](https://www.shaneco.com/my-account/myway)

* Visiting our opt-out page at [https://www.shaneco.com/unsubscribe](https://www.shaneco.com/unsubscribe)

* Emailing us at [DataProtection@ShaneCo.com](mailto:%E2%80%9Cdataprotection@shaneco.com%E2%80%9D)

* To stop receiving our promotional texts, you may opt-out by one of the following methods:

* Replying STOP to any text message we send you

* Texting STOP at any time to 720-730-2009 or call 866-467-4263.

* Logging into your ShaneCo.com account and changing your SMS preference under the Shane Co. MyWay section [https://www.shaneco.com/my-account/myway.](https://www.shaneco.com/my-account/myway)

* Emailing us at [DataProtection@ShaneCo.com](mailto:%E2%80%9Cdataprotection@shaneco.com%E2%80%9D)

* As otherwise described in Section 5 

If you opt-out of receiving text messages, you may receive one final text message confirming your decision to unsubscribe.

Opting out of one form of communication does not mean you’ve opted out of other forms as well. For example, if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, you may still receive marketing text messages.

Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages. These include responses to your questions.

**California.**

This supplemental privacy notice may apply to California residents is provided to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the Consumer Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA"), and other California privacy laws.

Consumer Rights Under the CCPA and CPRA. The CCPA and CPRA establish several rights for you, the consumer. 

You have the right to submit several requests regarding the personal information we have collected about you. You may make such a request for disclosure or deletion of personal information twice within any given 12-month period. We will provide responsive information for a period of 12 months preceding the date of your request. We will provide this information to you within a period of 45 days from the date of your request. If needed, we may require up to an additional 45 days to complete the request but will provide notice to you of the need for the additional time prior to the expiration of the initial 45-day period.

To respond to your request, we will need to obtain enough information from you to verify that yours is a valid and legitimate request. This provides further protection for your personal information.

Right to Request Disclosure of Sensitive and Personal Information. You may request that we disclose the categories of sensitive and personal information that we have collected about you, the specific pieces of sensitive and personal information that we have collected about you, or both. 

Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information. In the event that any of the personal information we maintain about you is incorrect, you have the right to request that we correct it.

Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. You may request that we limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services, and other specific uses delineated in the CCPA and CPRA. 

The CCPA and CPRA define "sensitive personal information" as personal information that reveals any of the following: 

* A consumer’s social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number;

* A consumer’s account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account;

* A consumer’s precise geolocation;

* A consumer’s racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership;

* The contents of a consumer’s mail, email, and text messages unless the business is the intended recipient of the communication;

* A consumer’s genetic data;

* The processing of biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer;

* Personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health; and

* Personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s sex life or sexual orientation. 

Right to Opt-Out. If we engage in cross-context behavioral advertising, you may request that we stop sharing your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information. You also have the right to submit a request that we delete the personal information we have collected about you. There are several exceptions to the consumer’s right to deletion; namely, we may retain your information despite your request for deletion if we require the information in order to do any of the following: 

 * Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected;

* Provide a good or service requested by the consumer or reasonably anticipated within the context of a business’s ongoing business relationship with the consumer;

* Otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer;

* Detect security incidents and protect against “malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity;”

* Use for internal debugging purposes or to repair software errors;

* Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise free speech, or any other right provided by law;

* Use the information to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act;

* Engage in research in the public interest that follows all other privacy laws (with consumer consent);

* Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer’s relationship with the business;

* Comply with a legal obligation; or

* Otherwise use the information internally in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information. 

Note, however, that your information, including Sensitive Personal Information, is retained indefinitely for the purposes of providing our lifetime warranty services on the products we sell. To receive these services, we need your personal information to tie back your ownership of product to a specific transaction.

How to Submit a Request. We offer consumers two distinct methods for submitting requests to exercise their rights under the CCPA and CPRA:

Submitting a verifiable consumer request does not require that you have an active account with us, nor are you required to create an account. As previously noted, we will need to obtain enough information from you to verify your request in protection of your information before responding to your request. Information that we may need from you to verify your request may include the following:

Requests by an Authorized Agent. A California resident may use an authorized agent to submit a right to know request or a request to delete. To use an authorized agent to submit such a request, the California resident must provide the agent with written authorization. In addition, the California resident may be required to verify their own identity with us or to authenticate the agent’s authorization. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof, including written authorization from the resident, that the agent has been authorized by the California resident to act on their behalf. However, such requirements will not apply where a California resident has provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000 to 4465.

Right to Not be Discriminated Against for Exercising the Rights to Disclosure or Deletion. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA and CPRA. Unless otherwise permitted by the CCPA, the CPRA, or other California law, we will not deny you goods or services, charge you a different rate for goods or services, provide you a different quality of goods or services, or suggest that any aspect of your service will change if you exercise any of your rights enumerated here in this policy.

Categories of Information We Collected About Consumers in the Past 12 Months: As indicated in Section 1.

  

Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties. As indicated in Section 1.

(for example, to facilitate a purchase on Shaneco.com, to provide you with other services that you request, or for resolving billing or customer service inquiries related to your use of our Services); necessary to comply with legal requirements; necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the website and our Services); and, where legally required and we have no other valid legal basis to process Personal Data, we will use consent by our customers (for example, to provide you with marketing information or share information with third parties), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by emailing privacy@shaneco.com) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

In some instances, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data for processing as described above, for us to be able to provide you all our Services, and for you to use all the features of our Sites.

**Specific Purposes and Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data**

Personal data will be processed for the following purposes based on the defined legal bases:** 

 *** Provision of our services in stores and provision of our services online, such as on websites and platforms (contract or its preparation, legitimate interest).

* Processing and replying to contact requests, e.g., website contact forms, phone calls, emails (contract, legitimate interest).

* Processing orders and servicing customer accounts (contract or its preparation, legitimate interest).

* Provision and improvement of customer service and support and customer communications (legitimate interest).

* Monitoring the effectiveness of our sales promotion and marketing campaigns (legitimate interest).

* Promoting our services and brand and increasing brand awareness (legitimate interest).

* Advertising and offering our services, including direct electronic and non-electronic marketing, targeted marketing and advertising (consent, legitimate interest).

* Monitoring the use of our website and platforms and to improve the site functionality and user experience and to present the content of our website and platforms in a manner ideal for the visitor’s device, i.e. personalize the experience (consent).

* Analyzing how users use our platforms (consent).

* Providing marketing on our website and platforms using cookies (consent).

* Sending messages and push notifications regarding services that customers request (consent).

* Developing and improving our services and platforms, for example by voluntary surveys (consent).

* Ensuring security of our services and preventing abuses (legal obligation or legitimate interest).

* Complying and fulfilling our legal duties and obligations such as tax law and accounting related obligations (legal obligation).

* Establishing, exercising, or defending against legal claims (legal obligation or legitimate interest).** 

**

For processing activities that are based on a legitimate interest, we have carefully balanced such legitimate interest with the Customers’ right to privacy and concluded that our interest outweighs the Customers’ rights and freedoms.

Where the processing is such that consent is required by the applicable legislation, we will state so and obtain the consent, and this will be the legal basis for the processing. However, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. If such withdrawal means that we are no longer able to provide our services, we may cease to provide the services.

**International Transfers of Personal Data**

The nature of Shane Co.’s business means that the Personal Data collected through our Services will be transferred to the United States. Also, the Shane Co. personnel and some of the third-parties to whom we disclose Personal Data (as set out above) are located in the United States. We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality and we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data, remains protected and secure. If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States. Also, our personnel and the third parties to whom we disclose Personal Data are located in the United States.

**Your Rights**

Right of access and right of inspection_._ The Customer has the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed.

The Customer has the right to inspect and view data concerning them and, upon a request, the right to obtain the data in a written or electric form. This applies to information that the Customer has provided to us insofar the processing is based on a contract/consent.

Right to rectification and right to erasure_._ The Customer has the right to demand the rectification of incorrect personal data concerning them and to have incomplete personal data completed.

The Customer has the right to require us to delete or stop processing the Customer’s personal data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing.

However, please note that certain personal data is strictly necessary to achieve the purposes defined in this Notice and may also be required to be retained by applicable laws.

Right to data portability_._ The Customer has the right to receive the personal data that the Customer has provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if desired, transmit that data to another controller. The right to data portability applies to the processing of the personal data based on consent or a contract.

Right to restriction of processing_._ The Customer has the right, under conditions defined by data protection legislation, to request the restriction of processing of his or her personal data. In situations where personal data suspected to be incorrect cannot be corrected or removed, or if the removal request is unclear, we will limit the access to such data.

Right to object to processing_._ The Customer has the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing. For example, the Customer may object to his or her personal data being used for marketing purposes.

Right to withdraw consent_._ In cases where the processing is based on the Customers’ consent, the Customer has the right to withdraw his or her consent to such processing at any time.

Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority_._ The Customer has the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority if the Customer considers that the processing of personal data relating to the Customer infringes current legislation.

However, we request that the matter be dealt with Shane Co. in the first instance. The relevant authority in Europe is the data protection authority of your country of residence.

Requests regarding the rights of Customers shall be made in written or in electronic form, and the request shall be addressed to the Data Protection Officer at [DataProtection@shaneco.com](mailto: dataprotection@shaneco.com%E2%80%9D rel=). You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law. A list of EU data protection authorities is available at [http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item\_id=612080](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080). We do, however, hope you first raise the issue with us so we may work towards a prompt resolution on your behalf.

Please note that your identity will be checked before the information is given out, which is why we may have to ask for additional details. The request will be responded to within a reasonable time and, where possible, within one month of the request and the verification of identity.

If the Customer’s request cannot be met, the refusal shall be communicated to the Customer in writing. We may refuse the request (for example erasure of data) due to a statutory obligation or a statutory right of the company, such as an obligation or a claim relating to our services. Please note that we may charge a reasonable fee where requests from a Customer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.

If you have any questions relating to our data protection policies or wish to exercise your rights, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Moreover, if you no longer want to receive email communications from us, you may unsubscribe by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in our email.

**19. Terms of Use, Notices, Revisions, Limitation on Liability, Arbitration**

If you choose to visit ShaneCo.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Colorado. If you have any concern about privacy at ShaneCo.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Notice and the Terms of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our Sites frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

Except where prohibited, by visiting and using ShaneCo.com, you agree that: (1) any and all questions, controversies, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of this Notice shall be resolved exclusively by means of arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in Denver, Colorado, and shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action or representative action, and you agree that you shall not seek to aggregate any claims with other individuals; (2) SHANE CO.’S LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTICE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, UNDER ANY WARRANTY, IN NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $1.00 AND SHALL BE FURTHER LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN SUCH AMOUNTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHANE CO. SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO CLAIM ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR ATTORNEYS FEES ARISING OUT OF THIS NOTICE, AND ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED (EVEN IF YOU OR ANY OF YOUR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), AND TO RECOVER OTHER SUCH RELATED COSTS OF BRINGING A CLAIM, NOR SHALL AN ENTRANT BE ENTITLED TO RESCIND THIS AGREEMENT NOR SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR ANY OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules of the State of Colorado or of any other jurisdiction. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three per party and shall be held within twenty days of the making of a request. Additional depositions may be scheduled only with the permission of the arbitrators, and for good cause shown. Each deposition shall be limited to a maximum of seven hours duration. Time is of the essence for any arbitration under this agreement and arbitration hearings shall take place within ninety (90) days of filing and awards rendered within one hundred twenty (120) days. The Arbitrator shall agree to these limits prior to accepting appointment. The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute. The prevailing party shall not be entitled to an award of attorney fees. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness. In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator may require for the making of an award. Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above.

We will also, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, disable and/or terminate the use of the Platform by users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights of others in accordance with the DMCA.

  

**A. Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement**

Please note that if you misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees.

**C. Repeat Infringer Policy**

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, we will, at our discretion, disable and/or terminate access to the Platform by users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights of others.

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, we will, at our discretion, disable and/or terminate access to the Platform by users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights of others. This determination will be based on the number of “strikes” against the user. A “strike” is counted against a user each time there is an adjudication by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction that the user has engaged in copyright infringement of any kind in relation to the Platform.

Each adjudication counts as a separate strike. If an adjudication pertains to multiple instances of copyright infringement, it can count as multiple strikes. We have adopted a “three strikes and you’re out” policy under which a user who accumulates three strikes is considered a repeat infringer and may be subject to account termination.
