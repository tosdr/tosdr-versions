##### Privacy Policy

For use by Northwest Harvest; and all its programs, initiatives and affiliates, owner of [www.northwestharvest.org](https://www.northwestharvest.org/).

We are committed to protecting your privacy at Northwest Harvest and to holding any information received in strict confidence. We will not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We do not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement.

**1\. Introduction**  
Northwest Harvest takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes how and why we obtain, store and process data which can identify you. We may update this policy from time to time and shall indicate on the website when changes have been made.

**2\. The information we collect**  
Information is collected from you when you register with us, or when you contribute to or use some of the advanced features on the site. The information we collect is clearly set out on the web page on which we collect it. See for example our e-newsletter registration and healthy home assessment quiz.

**3\. Why we collect it**  
We collect information about you so that we can personalize your use of the site, assist your use of the site and improve the site generally.

**4\. Who we disclose it to**  
4.1 We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as opposed to aggregate information) to other Coalition staff or third parties to enable us to perform services requested by you or with your prior consent. Any personal information provided is confidential and protected and may be disclosed only under specific conditions and with prior written authorizations and consents.

4.2 If you give your consent, we will pass your contact details to third parties who may then occasionally send communications to you to provide information and services that may be of interest to you.

4.3 In certain circumstances we may need to disclose information about you if you breach this privacy policy or if you breach the Terms and Conditions. We may also disclose or access your account if required to do so by law.

**5\. How we use cookies**  
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Cookies are commonly utilized by most Internet users.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

**6\. Security**  
Keeping information about you secure is very important to us and certain sections of the site may encrypt data using SSL or a comparable standard. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. We strive to protect your personal information, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk. We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information you disclose both in your browsing and to only release this information to third parties we believe share our commitment to privacy. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties.

**7\. Links to other websites**  
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

In no event will we be liable for any loss or damage including without limitation, indirect or consequential loss or damage, or any loss or damage whatsoever arising from loss of data or profits arising out of, or in connection with, the use of this website.
