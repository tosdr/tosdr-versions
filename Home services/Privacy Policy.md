California Privacy Policy for California Residents
==================================================

### (Last Updated May 8, 2024)

[California Notice at Collection](#california_notice_at_collection)

Privacy Policy for Consumers

This California Privacy Policy for California Residents (this “**CA Privacy Policy**”) supplements the information contained in our Privacy Policy and applies solely to you if you meet the definition of “Consumer” under the CCPA, which generally means you are natural person who resides in the State of California. We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the voter-approved California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CRPRA” and collectively, the "CCPA”) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this CA Privacy Policy.

This CA Privacy Policy does not apply to workforce-related personal information collected from California-based employees, job applicants, contractors, or similar individuals. For more information on those policies please refer to our employee handbook.

Information We Collect

We collect information that directly or indirectly identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, with a particular consumer, household, or device ("personal information").

For purposes of this CA Privacy Policy and under the CCPA, personal information does not include:

* Publicly available information from government records.
* Deidentified or aggregated consumer information.
* Information excluded from the CCPA's scope, like:
    * health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), clinical trial data, or other qualifying research data;
    * personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.

In particular, we have collected the categories of personal information from consumers within the last twelve (12) months described below in the Section entitled [Sharing Personal Information](#sharing_personal_information).

Use of Personal Information

We may use, sell, or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following purposes:

* To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, if you share your name and contact information to request a price quote or ask a question about our or our client's products or services, we will use that personal information to respond to your inquiry.
* To provide, support, personalize, and develop our Website.
* To create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us.
* To provide you with support and to respond to your inquiries, including to investigate and address your concerns and monitor and improve our responses.
* To personalize your Website experience and to deliver our client’s content and the product and service offerings relevant to your interests, including targeted offers and ads through our Website, third-party sites, and via telephone, email or text message (with your consent, where required by law).
* To help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our Website and our client’s products and services, databases and other technology assets, and business.
* For testing, research, analysis, and product development, including to develop and improve our Website, and our and our customer’s products, and services.
* To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
* As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.
* To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our Website users is among the assets transferred.

We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.

Sharing Personal Information

We may share your personal information by disclosing it to a third party for a business purpose.

We only make these business purpose disclosures under written contracts that describe the purposes, require the recipient to keep the personal information confidential, and prohibit using the disclosed information for any purpose except performing the contract.

Reselling Personal Information

Reselling Personal Information

The CCPA prohibits a third party from reselling personal information unless you have received explicit notice and an opportunity to opt-out of further sales. As an advertising and marketing company our clients routinely purchase personal information from us and may resell that information. To opt-out of those sales, please [click here](https://homeservicescompliance.com/ccpaform.html?rpgn=&rpurl=).

Deidentified Patient Information

We do not sell or disclose deidentified patient information exempt from the CCPA to third parties.

Your Rights and Choices

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

| Your Rights | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Right to Know and Data Portability | You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months (the "right to know").

Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete), we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:<br><br>* Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.<br>* Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.<br>* Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.<br>* Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.<br>* Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.

Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete

To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, please submit a request by either:

| **Contact Us** |     |
| --- | --- |
| **By Telephone (Toll Free)** | **646-292-5232** |
| **Online** | [Submit Your Details Here](https://homeservicescompliance.com/ccpaform.html?rpgn=&rpurl=) |
| **By Mail** | **Converge Direct LLC  <br>25 W. 39th St., 6th Floor,  <br>New York, NY 10018** |

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal information. You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make these privacy requests on your behalf to exercise these rights. An authorized agent may submit a request on your behalf if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney in accordance with California law. If this has not occurred, we will require the agent to provide proof that you have authorized it to act on your behalf and may require you to verify your own identity with us directly before we accept a request. We will do this by requiring the authorized agent to present verifiable written authorization from you that you have provided the agent with permission to submit the request and independently verify the agent's own identity with us.

You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: your email address, full name, postal address, date of birth, phone number, and any other reasonable information we require to process your request.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete. We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it.

For instructions on exercising your sale opt-out or opt-in rights, see [Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights](#personal_information_sales_opt-out_and_opt-in_rights).

Response Timing and Format

We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at [](mailto:info@convergemarketing.com)[info@convergemarketing.com](mailto:info@convergemarketing.com).

We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, for example by using an SFTP platform.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights

If you are age 16 or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out"). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years old. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page link [here](https://homeservicescompliance.com/ccpaform.html?rpgn=&rpurl=).

Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into personal information sales at any time by visiting our Websites.

Non-Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time. We currently do not provide any financial incentives.

CCPA Rights Request Metrics

The CCPA establishes separate recordkeeping requirements for large businesses to track and publish specific metrics around consumer rights requests ("CRR Metrics"). This metrics rule applies to a business that knows or should know that it, alone or in combination, buys, sells, shares, otherwise makes available, or receives for commercial purposes the personal information of more than 10 million consumers in a calendar year, which represents approximately 25% of California's current population. Those large businesses must compile, and publish in their privacy policies by July 1 of each calendar year, the following CRR Metrics for the prior calendar year. The Company only came into existence in March of 2024, therefore, assuming the CRR Metrics rule applied to the Company, such a report would not be due until July 1, 2025. If and when we do publish CRR Metrics they will be available separately on this Website.

Other California Privacy Rights

California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to us at: Converge Direct LLC, 25 W. 39th St., 6th Floor, New York, NY 10018.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to amend this CA Privacy Policy at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this CA Privacy Policy, we will post the updated notice on the Website and update the notice's effective date.
