STREAM Privacy Policy

This document will not be changed.

Cookie information
------------------

STREAM does not involve in cookie and tracking activity, as doing such will invade the consumer privacy rights and trust. STREAM does not need to revise this decision again.

Search and Query tracking
-------------------------

STREAM does not record or capture your search results, infact we do not even allow third party companies like Google to operate on STREAM, which means, STREAM does not keep your information, it is all 100% private and never logged. This is really a point in privacy in STREAM as well as a disadvantage since services like autofill and predictions cannot be implemented.

Law Enforcement and STREAM
--------------------------

STREAM cannot provide any information with local law enforcement agencies as protecting our consumers is our highest priority. We will not help those trying to gain information off STREAM and will refuse any requests to do so.
