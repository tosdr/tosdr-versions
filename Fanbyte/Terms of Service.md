#### Section 9. Third-Party Services, Third Party Fees, and Linked Websites

#### Access to Third Party Services

The Service may provide you with access to third party websites, databases, networks, servers, information, software, programs, systems, directories, applications, or products or services (collectively, "**Third Party Services**”). ZAM provides access to such Third Party Services only as a convenience and ZAM does not have or maintain any control over Third Party Services.

#### Disclaimer of Liability for Third Party Services

Third Party Services may have their own terms of use and privacy policy, and your use of the Service may incur third party fees, such as fees charged by your Carrier for data usage. You are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with any terms of use, privacy policy or other terms governing your use of Third Party Services, and you are solely responsible for all of Third Party Services fees incurred by you for use of the Service. You are solely responsible for taking the precautions necessary to protect yourself from fraud when using Third Party Services, and to protect your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content that may be included on or with any Third Party Services. ZAM disclaims any and all responsibility or liability for any harm resulting from your use of Third Party Services, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against ZAM with respect to any Third Party Services.

#### Section 10. Third-Party Software

Software you download in connection with the Service consists of a package of components that may include certain third party software ("**Third Party Software**”) provided under separate license terms (the "**Third Party Terms**”). Your use of the Third Party Software in conjunction with the Service in a manner consistent with this EULA is permitted, however, you may have broader rights under the applicable Third Party Terms, and nothing in this EULA is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of the Third Party Software.

#### Section 11. Fees; Payment Terms

Access to the Service, or to certain features of the Service, may require you to pay fees, and may provide you the option to activate recurring automatic payments for those fees. Before you pay any fees, including before activating or updating any recurring payments, you will have an opportunity to review the fees that you will be charged before you accept them. If you activate or update recurring payments through the Service, you authorize ZAM to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums plus any applicable taxes, and other charges, using the Payment Information (defined below) you have provided. ZAM will send you a reminder of such recurring payment with the then-current and applicable fees in accordance with applicable law. Recurring payments will continue until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Service in accordance with this EULA. **You may cancel recurring charges at any time via the functionality of the Service or by emailing ZAM directly at the applicable contact information listed in Section 26. It may take up to 10 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect**. You will be responsible for all accrued sums (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then-current subscription period. If you cancel, your right to use the Services will continue until the end of your then current subscription period and will then terminate without further charges.

Whether you make a one-time payment of fees or active or update recurring payments through the Service (each, a "**Transaction**”), you expressly authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge you for such Transaction. Unless otherwise agreed, ZAM accepts credit cards through our third party payment processor. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, "**Payment Information**”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, **you thereby authorize ZAM to provide your payment details to our third party payment processor** so we can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method for the type of Transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). By initiating a Transaction, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, as posted or otherwise communicated to you.  All fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable, except as expressly provided in this EULA. If ZAM changes the fees for the Service, including by adding additional fees or charges, you will be provided advance notice of those changes and the opportunity to accept the changes. If you do not accept the changes, ZAM may discontinue providing the Service to you.

#### Section 12. Termination of Use; Discontinuation and Modification of the Service

You may terminate or delete your account at any time upon request by contacting customer service using the applicable contact information listed in Section 26. If you elect to delete your account, please see our Privacy Policy for what we will do with your data. If you terminate or delete your account, you remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees, if any, incurred prior to termination relating to your use of the Service. If you violate any provision of this EULA, your permission from us to use the Service terminates automatically. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, ZAM may terminate your user account on the Service or suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or any part of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without notice. We expressly disclaim all liability for any change to the Service or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Service.

Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Services or your account, Sections 6 through 9, 11, 12 through 25, and 27, along with the Privacy Policy, will survive.

#### Section 13. Privacy Policy; Additional Terms

Your use of the Service is subject to the Privacy Policy and the Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into this EULA. By using the Service, you agree that you have read, understood, and agree to the data collection, use, and disclosure provisions set forth in the Privacy Policy.

#### Consent to Use of Data

You agree that ZAM may collect and use technical data and related information, including, but not limited to, UDID, and other technical information about your device, system, application software, and peripherals, that is gathered to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Service, and to anonymously track and report your activity inside of the Service, including for analytics purposes.

#### Additional Terms

Your use of the Service is subject to all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Service or certain features of the Service that we may post on or link to from the Service ("**Additional Terms**”), such as end-user license agreements for any downloadable software applications, or rules applicable to a particular feature or content on the Service. All Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, this EULA.

#### Section 14. Modification of this EULA

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or update this EULA on a going-forward basis at any time. Please check this EULA periodically for changes. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted an updated EULA it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore. Disputes arising under this EULA will be resolved in accordance with the version of this EULA in effect at the time the dispute arose. Because the Service is evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time and without notice to you, at our sole discretion.

#### Section 15. Ownership; Proprietary Rights

The Service is owned and operated by ZAM. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other content and elements of the Service ("**Materials**”) provided by ZAM are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials are the property of ZAM or our third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by ZAM, you may not make use of the Materials. ZAM reserves all rights not granted expressly in this EULA. You acknowledge that the Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the U.S. and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Service.

#### Section 17. Indemnity

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you are responsible for your use of the Service, and you will defend and indemnify ZAM and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the "**ZAM Entities**”) from and against every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your access to, and use of, the Service; (b) your User Content; (c) your violation of any portion of this EULA, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in this EULA, or any applicable law or regulation; (d) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (e) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim.

#### Section 18. Disclaimers; No Warranties

THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS, USER CONTENT AND THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS” AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE ZAM ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS, USER CONTENT, THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE ZAM ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS, USER CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.  WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR USER CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE ZAM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS EULA. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE, YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER, AND ANY MATERIALS OR USER CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICE, AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR USER CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE THROUGH THE SERVICE AND ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICES, AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY, OR THE LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THAT MATERIAL, USER CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

We make no claims that any Material or content within the Service therein is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the U.S. or outside the country where such Material or any content was produced. Access to the Material or any other content within the Service may not be legal in certain countries or for certain persons. If you access any Material or other content from outside of the U.S., you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. You agree to comply with: (i) all local rules regarding user conduct on the Internet and acceptable content; and (ii) all applicable laws regarding the downloading and/or transmission of technical data and other material from or to the U.S. and the country in which you are located.

#### Section 19. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE ZAM ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS; SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS, USER CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY ZAM ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE ZAM ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS EULA, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO ZAM FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT(S) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; OR (B) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO ZAM, AS APPLICABLE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

EACH PROVISION OF THIS EULA THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS EULA. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 19 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

#### Section 20. Third Party Disputes

ZAM IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY CARRIER, SERVICE PROVIDER, OR THIRD PARTY SERVICE, AND ANY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH ANY CARRIER, SERVICE PROVIDER, THIRD PARTY SERVICE, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OTHER USER OF THE SERVICE, IS DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOU AND THAT THIRD PARTY, AND YOU IRREVOCABLY RELEASE ZAM (AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THOSE DISPUTES.

#### Section 21. Governing Law

This EULA, and any action related thereto, will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law and the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 23 "Dispute Resolution and Arbitration” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and ZAM are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Los Angeles County, California and you and ZAM each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

#### Section 22. General

This EULA, together with any Additional Terms and the Privacy Policy, is the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and ZAM regarding your use of the Service, and this EULA supersedes and replaces all prior and contemporaneous oral or written understandings or agreements between ZAM and you regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer this EULA, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this EULA, without such consent, will be null. We may assign this EULA at any time without notice or consent. Subject to the foregoing, this EULA will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. Failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this EULA, or any provision of this EULA, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Except as expressly set forth in this EULA, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this EULA will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this EULA or otherwise. If any part of this EULA is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Any notices or other communications provided by ZAM under this EULA will be given: (a) via email; or (b) by posting to the Service. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. NOTHING IN THIS EULA WILL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.

#### Section 23. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

#### Section 23.1. Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes

We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this EULA or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and ZAM agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this EULA, and that you and ZAM are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this EULA.

#### Section 23.2. Exceptions

As limited exceptions to Section 23.1 above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.

#### Section 23.3. Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules

The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this EULA. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175). Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

#### Section 23.4. Arbitration Costs

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

#### Section 23.5. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

Except as provided in Section 23.2 above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

#### Section 23.6. Class Action Waiver

YOU AND ZAM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section shall be null and void.

#### Section 23.7. Severability

With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 23.6 ("Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this EULA is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this EULA will still apply.

#### Section 24. Consent to Electronic Communications

By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.

No more than the stated number of prizes will be awarded. In event that production, technical, programming, or any other reasons cause more than the stated number of prizes as set forth in the applicable terms and conditions to be available or claimed, ZAM reserves the right to award only the stated number of prizes by a random drawing among all legitimate, unawarded, eligible prize claims.

#### Section 28. Game Play Competitions and Points

The below terms and conditions apply to any Competitions (defined below) hosted by ZAM on the Service. Additional terms and conditions may apply, and these terms and conditions may be found on the applicable Competition webpage.

#### Game Play

The Service may permit users who have an active email account and Internet access to compete in certain game play or competitions offered via the functionality of the Service (each, a "**Competition**”), view Competitions, and compete for points ("**Game Play Points**”) based on the results of Competitions. Your skill, your skill relative to others, and the number of other users participating in a Competition are a few of the factors that may determine the amount of Game Play Points you may receive, if any. No entry fee, Game Play Points, or other consideration is required to participate in any Competition.

#### License to Game Play Points

Game Play Points are provided under a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use within the Service in accordance with this EULA. You obtain no property interest in Game Play Points. You may not transfer, sell, auction, offer, or resell Game Play Points in any manner, including within or outside of the Service. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the account of any user who transfers, sells, auctions, offers, or resells Game Play Points in violation of this EULA. We reserve the right to remove or modify Game Play Points from your account in our sole discretion and without notice. We have no liability for hacking or loss of your Game Play Points, and we have no obligation to reimburse you for any Game Play Points that are lost due to your violation of these Terms or any other reason.

#### No Value in Game Play Points

We may use other terms to describe Game Play Points, including, but not limited to, such terms as "gold”. Regardless of what we call them, Game Play Points are not real money and do not have monetary or financial value. We may distribute Game Play Points in our sole discretion. Any Game Play Point balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but rather constitutes a measurement of the extent of the license granted to you by us. You acknowledge that Game Play Points are not real currency and are not redeemable from us at any time.

#### Prizes

We may offer prizes, including cash, as indicated on the Competition webpage (each, a "**Prize**”), in association with Competitions. Any cash Prize is displayed and paid in U.S. dollars. Subject to applicable law, if we mistakenly credit a Prize to your account, we remain the owner of that Prize and may automatically deduct the mistaken Prize from your account upon discovery of our error and you will owe us the equivalent of any Prize mistakenly credited to you. Such obligation to reimburse us for any mistakenly credited Prize will survive any termination of this EULA or of your account.
