ZAM Network LLC (doing business as Fanbyte) is a company with principal offices at 12777 West Jefferson Blvd – Building E, Los Angeles, CA 90066, USA, and is the data controller for the purposes of data protection law. Our data protection officer can be contacted at [privacy@zam.com](mailto:privacy@zam.com).

The Privacy Policy explains how ZAM collects, uses, and otherwise processes information we obtain through your use of our products and services available on our website www.fanbyte.com or any other websites, apps, pages, features, advertising functionality, or content we own or operate (collectively, the “**Services**”). The terms “ZAM,” “we,” and “us” include ZAM Network LLC (doing business as Fanbyte) and our affiliates and subsidiaries. ZAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited (“Tencent”), a Cayman Islands company, and operates independently of Tencent. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites that simply name ZAM or have our logo on them.

“**Personal Information**” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is someone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, address, email address, telephone number, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, psychological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.

By using the Services, you confirm that you have read and understood the Privacy Policy and acknowledge that we will process Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### What Information We Collect & How We Use It

###### We collect the following Personal Information:

#### Registration and Account Information

We collect this when you register to use the Services, so that we can fulfil our contract with you. You must register to use the Services. To register, you need to provide your name, email address and password. You can also provide other voluntarily disclosed optional information, such as address, phone number, language and gender.

#### Information from Using the Service

We collect information you provide through your use of the Services. For example, when you interact with other users by posting comments and messages, chatting with other users on the Services, posting videos and screenshots, participating in promotions, and otherwise submitting information to the Services, the Services will collect the information you provide in such submissions. Some Services will also collect your postal address, telephone number, and other Personal Information from you when you make purchases from us and when you respond to surveys, polls, contests, giveaways, and other promotional activities. We do this in order to provide you with the Services, and because it is in our legitimate interests to provide a well-functioning and user-friendly site.

#### Customer Support & Communications

We collect Personal Information through your communications with our customer-support team. We do this in order to provide you with the Services, and because it is in our legitimate interests to support you and respond to your communications. We will send email to the email address you provide to us and push notifications to your mobile device if they are enabled, to verify your account and for informational and operational purposes, such as account management, customer service, system maintenance, order purposes, notifying contest winners, and other Services-related purposes. This information is required to enable us to fulfil our contract with you and if you do not provide this information, we will not be able to communicate with you about the Services or provide you with all of our Services.

#### Social Media Information

We collect this when you log into the Services via social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. When you choose to connect your social media account to your profile on the Services, we collect Personal Information from that social media website. For example, when you connect your Facebook account, we collect certain Personal Information you have made publicly available in Facebook, such as your name, user ID, profile picture, and certain any other information you have made public. When you allow it, we also obtain other non-public information from these social media websites. We do this because it is in our legitimate interests to enable you to connect via your social media account and provide a well-functioning site that you can integrate into your online experience.

#### Partner Site Credentials

When you log in or authenticate your account on the Services using your credentials from other partner gaming websites and applications (such as Battle.net and Twitch), we collect Personal Information about you, including a unique user ID, information about your avatars or game characters, and other gaming information. We do not receive your name, email address, or your account log-in credentials from our partners. We do this because it is in our legitimate interests to enable you to connect via our gaming partners and to provide a well-functioning site that you can integrate into your online experience.

#### Payments

When you make payments through the Services, you will need to provide financial account information, such as your credit card number, to our third-party service providers. We do not collect or store Personal Information, though we receive summary information about transactions, but it does not include credit card or bank account numbers. We collect this information because it is necessary to fulfil our contract with you, if you elect to join a premium subscription.

#### Advertising

Our Services are supported by advertising and marketing tailored to you. We use information, including Personal Information, to provide online advertising on the Services and to email you information we think will be useful or relevant to you. You may also choose to submit your Personal Information to take part in giveaways, sweepstakes and surveys. This is because we have a legitimate interest in marketing services to you, and in running advertisements to support our Services. We sometimes use cookies and other tracking technologies to help us with this – find out more in our section on ‘Cookies’ below. Where you consent, we may also use your Personal Information to send you electronic marketing. You can withdraw your consent to receiving electronic marketing communications any time by emailing [privacy@zam.com](mailto:privacy@zam.com).

#### Technical information

The Services automatically collect information about your device, such as a device ID and the browser type you are using, so that we can provide functionality, such as push notifications, and improve the functioning of the Services. You can also permit the Services to access your device’s contact list and photo storage. We also collect Internet protocol (IP) address, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, device type, IDFA, AAID, click-through data, preferences and usage statistics to analyse how our Services are used, to optimize your ability to view and use the Services and to provide targeted advertising. When we associate such information with Personal Information, we will treat the combination as Personal Information. We use your technical information because it is in our legitimate interests to provide a well-functioning site that meets your technical requirements. We also use this technical information to serve targeted advertising to you.

In addition, we will use your Personal Information to do the following, as it is in our legitimate interests to run a successful business:

#### Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies

When you use the Services or receive emails from us, we and our third party partners, such as advertising networks, social media widgets, and analytics providers (see below for more details on these partners) use “cookies” and other similar technologies to collect information about how the Services or email is accessed. The types of cookies we use include:

#### Strictly necessary cookies

These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Services. They include, for example, cookies that enable users to log into secure areas of our Services.

#### Analytical / performance cookies

These allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Services. This helps us to improve the way our Services work, for example, by ensuring that our users are finding what they are looking for easily.

#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to collect and process certain Services usage data. Google provides additional privacy options regarding cookie use described at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

#### Functionality cookies

These are used to recognize users when users return to our Services. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet users by name, remember a user’s preferences (for example, a user’s choice of language or region) and tailor our marketing outreach to our users based on their employment profile and engagement with our Services.

#### Targeting cookies

These cookies record a user’s visit to our Sites, the pages a user has visited and the links a user followed. We use this information to make the website more relevant to users. You are able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from advertisers or advertising networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out sections on the websites of each of those organizations. Links to those sites are on our [advertising addendum](https://www.zam.com/partner) and here: **Network Advertising Initiative:** [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) **Digital Advertising Alliance:** [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) **European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance:** [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)

When you opt out of personalized advertising, you will continue to see online advertising on the Services and/or our ads on other Internet websites.

Our partners will also collect information about your online activities over time and on other websites or apps. When they provide such services, they are governed by their own privacy policies.
