Privacy Policy
--------------

Jam City, Inc., along with its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively ‘Jam City’, ‘we’, ‘us,’ or ‘our’) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data (as the term is defined under applicable law) in our games, websites, applications, and other services (collectively, the ‘Services’). 

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, so please be sure to check regularly. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the primary access points to the Services or as otherwise required by applicable law. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you continue to use our Services after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.

Specific games may have additional privacy disclosures not covered in this policy – make sure to review the privacy disclosures applicable to every game you play.

### Meaning of Personal Data

‘Personal Data’ means information that identifies an individual directly or indirectly.  This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 

Personal Data does not include information that has been anonymized or aggregated in such a way that there is no serious possibility it can be used to identify an individual, whether on its own or in combination with other information.

### Your Consent to Collection, Use, and Disclosure

_Jam City collects, uses, discloses, and retains Personal Data that you provide to us with your consent._

We collect, use, and disclose your Personal Data with your consent or as permitted or required by law.  How we obtain your consent (i.e. the form we use) will depend on the circumstances, as well as the sensitivity of the information collected.  Subject to applicable laws, your consent may be express or implied, depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the Personal Data in question.  If you choose to provide Personal Data to us, we assume that you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Data as outlined in this privacy policy.

Typically, we will seek your consent at the time your Personal Data is collected. Where we want to use your Personal Data for a purpose not previously identified to you at the time of collection, we will seek your consent prior to our use of such information for this new purpose.

You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use, or disclosure of your Personal Data at any time by contacting us using the contact information in the ‘Contact Us’ section below.  However, before we implement the withdrawal of consent, we may require proof of your identity. In some cases, withdrawal of your consent may mean that we will no longer be able to provide certain products or services.

### Personal Data We Collect

While using the Services, you may provide us with Personal Data either directly or indirectly. The categories of Personal Data we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and the requirements of applicable law.

Any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services will be considered ‘public,’ unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other users.

For more information, please see the Mapbox privacy policy: [https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy)

* **_Crash reports_**

If you provide crash reports, we may collect Personal Data related to such crash reports, including detailed diagnostic information about your device and the activities that led to the crash.

* **_Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, Mobile Device Identifiers, and Interest-Based Advertising_** 

We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies (‘Technologies’) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

_Cookies._ Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.

_Pixel Tags/Web Beacons._ A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Services that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

_Mobile Device Identifiers._ Depending on your privacy settings, we may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device. In some cases, you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID.

_Analytics._ We may also use Technologies and other third-party tools to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on our Services. These Technologies allow us to better understand how our digital Services are used and to continually improve and personalize our Services. These Technologies include:

* _Google Analytics (Crashlytics and Firebase)._ For more information about how Google uses your Personal Data (including for its own purposes, e.g., for profiling or linking it to other data), please visit [_www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/._](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to [_http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout_](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

* _PlayFab:_ We use PlayFab for backend services and analytics. PlayFab collects geolocation at a country level. For more information, please see the Microsoft privacy policy: [https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement)

* _Adjust:_ To learn more about Adjust’s analytic tracking, you can review the Adjust [Privacy Policy](https://www.adjust.com/terms/privacy-policy/). To opt out of tracking by Adjust, visit [this page](https://www.adjust.com/forget-device/).

* _Facebook Insights:_ For more information regarding Meta’s privacy practices and to manage your preferences, please visit [https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy). 

Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:

_Operationally Necessary._ This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;

_Social Networking Services:_ We also may receive Personal Data from other third parties if you sign-up to use the Services via certain third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook (including on Facebook canvas), Apple, or Google (each a ‘Social Networking Service’). In this case, we may receive and use Personal Data you have provided to such Social Networking Services and made available via your account privacy settings, such as your name, profile picture, friends list and/or email address.

Our referral services may also allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services.

Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

You may also email us at [ccpaoptout@jamcity.com](mailto:ccpaoptout@jamcity.com) and we will do our best to assist you with your request.

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/), [https://youradchoices.ca/choices/](https://youradchoices.ca/choices/), and [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.

You can see the list of companies that may implement and/or access cookies and other technologies on your mobile device, and how to opt-out of such technologies (where available) at [http://www.jamcity.com/adpartners/](http://www.jamcity.com/adpartners/).

All Personal Data collected by Jam City may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to the United States in order to provide the Services.  As such, your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you choose to provide Personal Data to us, Jam City will transfer your Personal Data in accordance with the table below in order to provide the Services. 

If we transfer Personal Data which originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en).

We may use or disclose the Personal Data we collect for the purposes outlined in Use of Information above. Where required under applicable law, we will not collect additional categories of Personal Data or use the Personal Data we have collected for materially different, unrelated, or incomplete purposes without first providing you notice.

**_Sales/Sharing/Targeted Advertising:_**

Some of our disclosures of Personal Data may be considered a “sale” or “share” as those terms are defined under applicable law. In many states, a “sale” is broadly defined to include a disclosure for something of value, and, in California, a “share” is broadly defined to include a disclosure for cross-context behavioral advertising. We collect, sell, or share the categories of Personal Data as described in the table above.

**_Your Rights and Choices:_**

Subject to applicable law, if you are a resident of California, Virginia, Connecticut, Utah, or Colorado, you may have the following rights:

* **To Know and Access:** to obtain a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you. (Note that this right only applies to Personal Data relating to you, and not to any other user.)
* **Deletion:** to request that we delete your Personal Data. This right may be limited to the extent that we are permitted or required by applicable law to retain certain information. (Note that if you request deletion of your Personal Data, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services. If you decide to use or access the Services again, we may consider this a new account, and may collect Personal Data associated with that account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)
* **Opt-Out of Sales/Sharing/Targeted Advertising:** you have the right to opt-out of us selling or sharing your Personal Data to third parties, or processing your Personal Data for purposes of targeted advertising. To opt out of such selling, sharing, and targeted advertising, you may click the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our [https://www.jamcity.com](https://www.jamcity.com/) website footer and provide the information requested, provide the information requested in this opt out form: [https://support.jamcity.com/stateoptout](https://support.jamcity.com/stateoptout/), or email us at [ccpaoptout@jamcity.com](mailto:ccpaoptout@jamcity.com).
* **Correction:** to request the correction of inaccurate Personal Data that we may have on file about you.
* **Obtain additional details regarding our information practices:** You may have the right to request disclosures regarding our information practices. (Note that this information is generally available in this Privacy Policy.)

We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you exercise any of the rights listed above.

_Verification and Appeal Process:_ We are required by law to take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your request. Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If we are unable to process your request via you authenticating yourself on the Services, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request. 

If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied. 

_Authorized Agent:_ Depending on where you live, you may have the right to use an authorized agent on your behalf to exercise a privacy right discussed above. If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a user to exercise a privacy right discussed above, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the consumer. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of a consumer, then you can make a request on the consumer’s behalf by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in our [https://www.jamcity.com](https://www.jamcity.com/) website footer and providing the information requested, providing the information requested in this opt out form: [https://support.jamcity.com/stateoptout](https://support.jamcity.com/stateoptout/), or by contacting us at [ccpaoptout@jamcity.com](mailto:ccpaoptout@jamcity.com). To the extent permitted by applicable law, such requests must include the following information: (1) a written authorization from the consumer that includes the consumer’s first name, last name, and valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us, that is signed by the consumer and clearly bestows upon the agent the proper authority; and (2) a certificate of good standing with your state of organization. Alternatively, an acting agent can provide a valid power of attorney signed by the consumer on the agent’s behalf and a valid email address used by the consumer to interact with us. The email address of the consumer will be used to separately verify the agent’s authority with the consumer. The consumer may then be directed to submit a request through the designated methods above.  

_Refer-a-Friend, Promotions, and Similar Incentive Programs:_ We may offer referral programs, promotions such as sweepstakes, or other incentivized information collection programs. We may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide Personal Data regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your Personal Data in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please contact us as described below. 

_Shine the Light Disclosure:_ California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice that identifies the categories of Personal Data that we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and provides contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like this information, please submit a written request to us using the contact information below. 

**_De-Identified Information:_**

If we create or receive de-identified information, we will not attempt to reidentify such information, except to comply with applicable law.  

**_Supplemental Notice for Nevada Residents:_**

If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Data. You can exercise this right by contacting us at [privacy@jamcity.com](mailto:privacy@jamcity.com) with the subject line ‘Nevada Do Not Sell Request’ and providing us with your name and the email address associated with your account. Please note that we do not currently sell your Personal Data as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A. If you have any questions, please contact us as set forth in Contact Us below.

### Children’s Privacy Policy

Protecting children’s privacy online is very important to us. Generally, our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children. However, we do have some games that are likely to appeal to children.

For games that are not directed at children but nonetheless may appeal to them, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services based on the user’s age. For these services, when a user indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we will limit their access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, chat features, and certain types of notification alerts. For known underage users, we also limit personal data collection and sharing to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.

If you are a parent or guardian and have any concerns regarding the service, wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us at [privacy@jamcity.com](mailto:privacy@jamcity.com). If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete any Personal Data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.

_Third Party Service Providers_

We use the following third-party service providers in relation to our child-directed apps:

* We use Google Crashlytics and Firebase for bug reporting, crash reporting and analytics. For more information, please see the Google privacy policy here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* We use Helpshift for customer service and to host our FAQs. In the event we are contacted through our helpdesk by a child, we will reply once before immediately deleting the child’s email address and any associated Personal Data. For more information, please see the Helpshift privacy policy: [https://www.helpshift.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.helpshift.com/legal/privacy/)
* Our apps link out to this privacy policy hosted on our website. We use Google Analytics on the website to track page views. Google Analytics is restricted from sharing your user data. For more information, please see the Google privacy policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

_Frozen Adventures_

We use the following third-party service providers in relation to children in our Frozen Adventures app:

* We use PlayFab for backend services and analytics. PlayFab collects geolocation at a country level. For more information, please see the Microsoft privacy policy: [https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement)

In our Frozen Adventures app, if a user indicates that they are under 13, no ads are served. 

_Frozen Free Fall_

We use the following third-party service providers to serve contextual ads to users who indicate that they are under 18 in our Frozen Free Fall app. Users who indicate that they are under 18 in our Frozen Free Fall app are not tracked or served behavioral ads.

### 12\. Subscription Fees and Payments

Some Company games may offer a monthly subscription plan and a free trial subscription. If you purchase a subscription plan, the subscription fee will be charged to your iTunes Account if you use an Apple device, and through your Google Play account if you are an Android user. Subscription plan prices may vary depending on your country. Monthly subscriptions will be charged to you at the beginning of your subscription period and will be charged each month thereafter at the then-current rate unless you cancel.

**_Automatically Recurring Payment_**

When you purchase a Subscription Plan, you acknowledge that your subscription will automatically renew each month unless you cancel it or disable automatic renewal at least 24 hours before the end of the current monthly subscription period. Unless you cancel your subscription, the payment method you provided will be automatically charged each month the then-applicable monthly subscription fee, within 24 hours of the calendar day corresponding to the date of commencement of your subscription. If your monthly subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may charge you on such other day in the applicable month as we deem appropriate. For example, if your subscription started on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th and you will be billed on that date. Your Subscription Plan will continue until cancelled by you or we terminate access to or use of the Software in accordance with this Agreement.

**_Free Trials_**

We offer free trial subscriptions during which you may use the Services for a limited trial period without payment. Free trial subscriptions are only available to new subscribers. Unless you cancel your free subscription prior to the end of your trial, we (or our third-party payment processor) will begin charging you the applicable subscription fee, whether on a recurring basis for a monthly or annual subscription or a one-time basis for a lifetime subscription, until you cancel your subscription. Instructions for cancellation are stated below in the section titled ‘Cancellation of Subscription’ below. If you purchase a subscription plan before your free trial period expires, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited.

**_Cancellation of Subscription_**

You may cancel your subscription at any time. Unless an exception applies under applicable law in your jurisdiction, you will not receive a refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period at the time of cancellation. To cancel, you can turn off automatic renewals in the Account Settings of the Software. If you use the Software on an Apple device, you can also cancel through the Settings on your device.  Go to Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, tap your Apple ID, tap View Apple ID, sign in if requested, then tap Manage under Subscriptions. If you are an Android user, open the Google Play Store on your device, tap Menu and then Subscriptions. Tap the subscription to cancel, and then tap Cancel.

We may terminate access to or use of the Software, at our sole discretion, at any time and without prior notice. All fees are non-refundable, except as required by applicable law in your jurisdiction.

**_Subscription Price Changes_**

The price of subscriptions is subject to change at any time without notice. If we change the price of your monthly or annual subscription, you have the option to cancel at any time before the new price is applied.

### 13\. In-App Purchase - Fees and Payment

### 17\. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration Agreement

**Please read this section following section carefully as it limits the manner in which we can seek relief from each other.  This Section 17 only applies to you if you are a resident of the United States or if you commence any action against Company in the United States.**

1. Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Software or User Submissions (collectively, ‘**Disputes’**) will be resolved **solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding**. You and Company agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, and that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
2. Exceptions and Opt-out. As limited exceptions to Section 17(a) above: (i) you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. In addition, **you** **will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute** if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at [legal@jamcity.com](mailto:legal@jamcity.com) within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to this Agreement.
    
3. Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (‘AAA’) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules  (the ‘**AAA Rules’**) then in effect, except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section.  The AAA Rules are available on the [AAA website](https://www.adr.org/) and are hereby incorporated by reference. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state where the arbitration hearing is to be conducted, and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.  A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.
    

Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

4. Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. If you initiate the arbitration, the only fee you will be required to pay is a non-refundable $200 filing fee.  If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
5. Class Action Waiver.  **YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**  Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
6. Effect of Changes on Arbitration. If Company changes any of the terms of this Section 17 ‘Dispute Resolution’ after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [legal@jamcity.com](mailto:legal@jamcity.com)) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the ‘Last Updated’ date above or in the date of Company’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 17 ‘Dispute Resolution’ as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).
7. Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(e) of this Agreement (‘**Class Action Waiver’**), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement will still apply.

### 18\. Governing Law and Venue

Disputes will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 ‘Dispute Resolution,’ you agree that the California state and U.S.  federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all Disputes that you and Company are not required to arbitrate and you agree to the venue of such courts.

### 19\. Force Majeure

Company shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Company, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Company’s control such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.

### 20\. Copyright Dispute Policy

 Company has adopted the following general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA (posted at [www.lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf](http://www.lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf)). The address of Company’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (‘Designated Agent’) is listed at the end of this Section. It is Company’s policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.

**A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:**  
If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Software infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1\. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;  
2\. Identification of works or materials being infringed;  
3\. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Company is capable of finding and verifying its existence;  
4\. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;  
5\. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and  
6\. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

**B. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent:**  
It is Company’s policy:

1\. to remove or disable access to the infringing material;  
2\. to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and  
3\. that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Company will terminate such content provider’s, member’s or user’s access to the Software.

**C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:**  
If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider, member, or user, must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1\. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;  
2\. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;  
3\. A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and  
4\. Content provider’s, member’s or user’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located, or, if the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company’s discretion.
