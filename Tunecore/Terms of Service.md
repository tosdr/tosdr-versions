We reserve the right to reject or immediately terminate your account in our sole discretion, and without prior notice to you.
2. Purchase of Products. 
    
    1. When you order products you would like to purchase from the Distributor Site, you are making an offer to buy the ordered products on terms specified in the applicable order. Once your order has been placed, we will send you an email indicating receipt of your order. This email is only confirmation of our receipt of your order and does not constitute acceptance of your offer to buy. We reserve the right to reject any order for any reason or no reason, subject always to our compliance with applicable law. With regards to orders for physical products, your order and offer to buy is accepted when we have packaged your order and delivered it to the carrier and you will receive an email confirming that your order has been accepted when it has been delivered to the carrier. Title to the products you order, and risk of loss of those physical products, passes to you when the physical product has been delivered to the carrier. 
        
    2.

You consent to our use of any information provided by you, including personally identifiable information, to conduct anti-fraud checks at our sole discretion, and this authorization applies to use by our third party payment processor. In conducting such checks, we or our third party payment processor may disclose, and you authorize us and our third party payment processor to disclose, your information to credit reference and fraud prevention service providers, who may keep a record of the information disclosed.

The carrier will not be required to obtain a signature at delivery unless you specify otherwise when placing your order.
        
    4. All requests for returns must be made in writing not later than fourteen (14) days after the carrier delivers your order. If your purchase is defective, we will either (a) replace the defective product with the same product or its equivalent, or (b) refund your purchase price, at our sole discretion. We may, but are not required, to accept returns for other reasons, in which case we will provide you with a replacement product or credit at our sole discretion. In order to request a return, you must submit your request at [https://support.tunecore.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006501747-Contact-Us](https://support.tunecore.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006501747-Contact-Us).

    6. In addition to product purchases, some other aspects of the Distributor Site may require you to pay a fee, the details of which are available in various areas of the Distributor Site that feature the ability to purchase products, features or services.

We may revise the pricing for products, services or features offered through the Distributor Site at any time. Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in U.S. dollars. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes payable. If there is a dispute regarding payment of fees to, or products or services provided by, us, your account may be closed without warning or notice at our sole discretion. **_Except as otherwise set forth in any return policy or cancellation policy expressly applicable to our products, services or features, you acknowledge and agree that any applicable fees and other charges for products, services or features are not refundable in whole or in part. You are fully liable for all charges to your account, including any unauthorized charges._**

**Other Agreements**. You acknowledge that in providing the Services and payments hereunder, Distributor will be required to enter into certain agreements with various third parties including, but not limited to, digital service providers and/or payment processors.

1. 1. Infringement Claims. TuneCore, Inc. is the operator of the TuneCore Site. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and believe that any User Content or other Third Party Content infringes upon your copyrights or intellectual property rights, you may submit a notification pursuant to Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament, to Directive (UE) 2019/790 of the European Parliament and/or to section 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), as applicable, by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing:
        
        1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
            
        2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative listing of such works or a link or URL to all such works;
            
        3. The location of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity on the Distributor Sites and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, including the link or URL for all such material on the Distributor Sites;
            
        4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit Distributor to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
            
        5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
            
        6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
            

Distributor's designated copyright agent (“Copyright Agent”) to receive notifications of claimed infringement is:

copyright@tunecore.com

**_Failure to include all of the above information, especially specific information about where infringing content may be found, will result in a delay in the processing of your notification and may result in your having to repeat some or all of the above process._**

1. Notice And Takedown. If we receive proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, we will respond expeditiously by removing, or disabling access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing, as described below, or to be the subject of infringing activity. We will also comply with the appropriate provisions of the DMCA in the event a counter-notification is received, as described below.
    

We may, at our discretion, deny access to the Distributor Sites by, or disable and/or terminate the accounts of, Users who may be infringers.

1. Copyright Counter-Notices. If content you posted on the Distributor Sites was removed for copyright or intellectual property infringement, and you would like to dispute that removal, the process for counter-notifications, which is governed by Section 512(g) of the DMCA, is as follows:
    
    1. To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide our Copyright Agent, at the address set forth above, with a written communication that sets forth the items specified in Section 23.4 below.
        
    2. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the accounts of (or access privileges by) Users who are infringers. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes your copyright or the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
        
    
2. Elements of Counter-Notification. To expedite our ability to process your counter- notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):
    
    1. Identify the specific URLs of (or other information sufficient to allow us to identify) material that Distributor has removed or to which Distributor has disabled access. 
        
    2. Provide your full name, address, telephone number, email address and, if you are a registered User, the User name of your Distributor account.
        
    3. Provide a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Luxembourg and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification to our Copyright Agent in accordance with the process outlined above, or an agent of such person.
        
    4. Include the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”
        
    5. Sign the notice. If you are providing notice by email, a scanned physical signature or a valid electronic signature will be accepted. Send the communication to the following address: copyright@tunecore.com.
        

After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes any of your personally identifiable information set forth in the counter-notification. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having such Identifying Information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.

After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within ten (10) days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Distributor Sites. If we receive such notification, we will be unable to restore the items. If we do not receive such notification, we may, but are not obligated to, reinstate the disputed item(s).

1. Counter-Notification: If you reside outside of the United States, please understand that filing a counter-notice may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in Luxembourg and/or the United States of America if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of access privileges for Users who make a false or bad faith allegation of infringement or make a false or bad faith counter-notification in response to a notice of infringement. So, if you are not sure whether content you posted on the Distributor Sites is being infringed, or are otherwise unsure of whether to file a counter-notification using these procedures, we strongly recommend you first contact a lawyer knowledgeable in the laws of Luxembourg, the United States and the State of New York (as applicable). If you do wish to file a counter-notice, you should follow the process set forth above under the heading “Elements of Counter-Notification.”

    4. Claims. **_You agree that any cause of action brought by you arising out of or related to the Distributor Sites must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.

If, for any reason, we believe, have reason to believe, suspect, or are notified of any act, omission or circumstances which may or could (i) compromise or endanger the health, well-being or safety of any person, (ii) cause or lead to damage to persons or property (tangible or intangible), (iii) adversely affect, infringe upon or misappropriate the rights of others, (iv) harass or interfere with any other user or person, firm or enterprise, (v) interfere with or bypass our security or other protective measures applicable to our systems, networks and communications capabilities, (vi) breach or violate these Terms, or (vii) violate any law or regulation, we have the right, reserving cumulatively all other rights and remedies available to us at law, in equity and under this agreement with you, to report and provide information to any and all regulatory and law enforcement authorities and agencies and take any action permitted by law. **_You agree that you may only bring a cause of action against such Party (i.e. TuneCore or Believe) with whom you have or had a contractual relationship at the time of occurrence of the event giving rise to such cause of action._**
        
    5. Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the Party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of either Party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
        
    6. Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
        
    7. Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may be transferred or assigned by Distributor to an affiliate of Distributor or to any third party, without restrictions. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void.
        
    8. No Relationship. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Distributor as a result of these Terms or use of the Distributor Sites. You further acknowledge that by submitting User Content or other Third Party Content, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied or other relationship is created between you and Distributor other than pursuant to these Terms.
        
    9. Survival. Sections ‎5, ‎12, ‎15, ‎18, ‎19, ‎20, ‎21, ‎22, ‎23, and ‎24 (other than your duty to update account information), as well as any other provisions of these Terms which by their nature would survive any termination of these Terms, will survive any termination of these Terms or your account, whether by you or by Distributor.
        
    10. Headings. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.
        
    11. Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and Distributor relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter, excluding any Services Agreement that you may have entered into with Distributor. These Terms shall not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by Distributor as set forth in Section 3 above.
