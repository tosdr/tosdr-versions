Content Moderation, Monitoring & Reports

2. We reserve the right to restrict contact between members as a protection measure, if there have been complaints or if our system's algorithms prevent that contact.

4. We reserve the right to remove any user submission or terminate any user account or ban any user at any time for any action in violation of the Terms of Service including, for conduct detrimental to other users or SimilarWorlds, or for any other reason that in SimilarWorlds' sole discretion warrants such termination. When an investigation is required, due to a user report or other indication that a user may be engaged in illegal activities, we may examine private messages to assess for further proof of offenses. All content (posts, messages, media), transmitted on or uploaded to SimilarWorlds, are subject to scans for malware, child abuse material, and other types of content that can harm users of SimilarWorlds in any way.

If such content is identified, we will take appropriate actions, which may include removing the content and disabling accounts. Relevant information, which may include personal information and the violative content, is reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). Subsequently, NCMEC may share reports with law enforcement authorities worldwide, as deemed appropriate.

While we strive to maintain a safe and respectful environment, we do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or quality of user-generated content. You acknowledge that you may be exposed to content that you find objectionable, and you use the platform at your own risk.

Registration and Account Security

SimilarWorlds users can have either an Anonymous/Fictional or Real profile. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:

1. You will not create multiple accounts on SimilarWorlds in a way that can be seen as abusive usage. The average user has only one account, but it is acceptable for someone to own up to three accounts as long as your accounts are following our terms of service and not causing conflicts with other users. Canceling old accounts does not make it acceptable to create new accounts to stay on this limit.
2. You will not create additional accounts in order to be able to contact users who blocked you on your previous accounts.
3. You will not use any of your additional/alternative accounts to contact users who blocked you on any of your other accounts.

Termination

1. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate the terms, engage in fraudulent or abusive behavior, or fail to comply with applicable laws.
2. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account without the obligation of providing explicit justification. However, such actions will be taken in accordance with our commitment to maintaining a respectful and inclusive community. We will exercise this right judiciously and responsibly, considering the overall well-being of the platform and its users. Our aim is to ensure a safe, enjoyable, and positive environment for all members. While we may not always provide specific reasons for individual bans, we will consistently enforce our policies with a fair and common-sense approach. Users found in violation of our Terms of Service, including engaging in harmful behavior, spam, or other disruptive activities, may be subject to account suspension or termination.
3. You may cancel your account at any time by accessing your Account Settings, then Leave SimilarWorlds and following the instructions there. After your account has been set to hiatus, you can complete the process to cancel your account. Once canceled, it can no longer be reactivated.

Anonymous or Fictional Profiles

A profile is considered Anonymous or Fictional if its name, profile photo and personal information do not belong to the owner of the account. The profile must not impersonate another person. If the fictional profile contains photos belonging to another person, any descriptions in the photos and in the profile must be explicit that the person in the photos is not the owner of the account. The owner of the account must not post another person's photos unless they have the consent and authorization of the person in those photos.

Content Rating Levels

You must ensure that your posts are tagged properly.  
SimilarWorlds is a very diverse social network, of varying opinions, ideologies and standards.  
In order to help protect users and provide the most relevant and appropriate content per each user's preferences, it is important that all users act responsibly, correctly labeling/categorizing their own content, especially when it falls into more adult themed categories.  
Users can select through their account settings, various "Content Rating Levels", which algorithmically determines what content may be most suitable and interesting for that user.  
Below is a description of each rating level:

* **Family Safe** - This category is for content that is considered to be completely safe, free of any Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Abusive, Offensive or Sensitive content.  
    This is typically content that is safe for viewing in the presence of family, co-workers, public audiences or in any other setting.  
    SimilarWorlds makes an extra effort to thoroughly screen (algorithmically) content entering this category, so that it is likely safe for even the youngest users of our website.
* **Non-Adult** - This category is for content that is considered to be safe, free of Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Abusive, Offensive or Sensitive content.  
    This is typically content that is safe for viewing in most settings. Content falling in this category must not be obviously Mature or Inappropriate in nature.  
    As SimilarWorlds allows for freedom of speech, opinion and expression, we attempt to strike some balance as to not over-aggressively filter everything appearing in this category.
* **Mildly Adult** - This category is for content which may be of "Mildly Adult" nature.  
    This includes very slightly/mildly Adult/Mature, very slightly/mildly Inappropriate, very slightly/mildly Offensive or very slightly/mildly Sensitive content.  
    Example: Mildly Adult Language, Jokes, References, Imagery.  
    Content within this category may be considered as "PG 13" by today's standards, but not at/above "18+" / "R" rating.
* **Adult** - This category is for content which may be of "Adult" nature.  
    This includes Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Offensive or Sensitive content.  
    Example: Adult Language, Jokes, References, Imagery (not including nudity).  
    Content within this category is not suitable for minors.  
    Please note that we do not allow the posting of Nudity, Extremely Offensive or Abusive content, within areas of SW that are labelled as "Adult".

**Although we allow freedom of speech, opinion and expression, users are not permitted to bully, abuse, harass or offend other members.**

You can also select the options below:

* **Nudity** - This category is for content which may contain imagery of mild "Nudity".  
    This includes any image, video or other media content which displays or depicts mild Nudity.  
    Please note that we do not allow images/videos that are focused or zoomed in to genital areas, or where sexually explicit acts are involved.
* **Fetish** - This category is for content which may be considered to be a "Fetish".  
    While the definition and categorization of "Fetish" is very broad, users are expected to use their discretion, while also keeping in line with the other Terms of Service of SimilarWorlds.  
    Please note that this category is NOT allowed the posting of highly Explicit, highly Violent or highly Revolting content.
* **Sensitive** - This category is for content which may be of "Sensitive" nature.  
    This includes content that may be visually or mentally disturbing to viewers.  
    Example: Content that is Mildly Gruesome, Revolting or Violent.  
    Please note that this category is NOT allowed the posting of Strong Violence, Strong Gore or Strong Revolting content.

**Prohibited Content**  
Users are prohibited from posting, sharing, or distributing copyrighted material without the explicit permission of the copyright owner, unless such use falls under fair use or other applicable exceptions as defined by copyright law.

**Repeat Infringers**  
We may terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe on copyright or intellectual property rights.

VIP Membership, Payment & Renewal Terms of Service

1. You can upgrade your account to VIP by paying or subscribing to one of the packages available. If you already have an active VIP subscription and purchase VIP again, the new VIP time you purchase will be added/accumulated onto your existing VIP time.
2. You may choose to purchase a VIP subscription for another user, by choosing that user at the time of purchase. If the recipient already has an active VIP subscription, the new VIP time you purchase will be added/accumulated onto their existing VIP time.
3. If you choose to become a VIP on SimilarWorlds, your membership subscription may be automatically renewed based on the frequency you choose, until canceled by you. After your initial subscription commitment period, your subscription may be automatically renewed for additional equivalent periods, at the purchase price of your initial subscription.
4. Once you have paid for any premium services on SimilarWorlds, they are non-refundable. In the exceptional scenario where we agree to offer a refund due to unusual circumstances, the transaction fee that we (the seller) were charged for (by the payment processor) in the original transaction will be deducted from the total amount refunded to you.
5. If, at any point, you wish to discontinue your VIP membership, and you have an active auto-renewable subscription, you must visit the VIP Subscriptions page and click 'Cancel' or 'Suspend' before the next scheduled automatic payment. We do not issue partial/pro-rated refunds for early cancelation of any subscriptions.
6. We do not have access to your Debit/Credit Card information through our sales. The payments are processed by a trusted 3rd-party payment processor, PayPal. By subscribing, you confirm you are at least 18 years of age and you authorize PayPal to charge your Debit/Credit Card now and again at the beginning of any subscription period. In the event that your Debit/Credit Card is ever denied, we reserve the right to cancel/suspend your subscription and you may have to resubscribe/resume in order to continue your VIP Membership.
7. You can also contact us by sending an email to **our email** with your question and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

Transferring VIP from an account to another is possible, by requesting this via an email or ticket to us, only in the following conditions:

* You intended to gift the VIP to someone else, but you forgot to choose the recipient at the time of purchasing, and you contacted us within a few hours after purchasing; or
* You want to transfer the remaining VIP time to another account of yours because you used the wrong account to purchase, and you contacted us within a few hours after purchasing.

Due to the variance between pricing rates, you cannot split a VIP purchase in smaller subscriptions, to be distributed between multiple accounts. If we transfer VIP membership between accounts, we will transfer the purchased package in full, to the target account, without possibility of splitting.

Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from your use or inability to use our platform. We do not assume responsibility for the actions, behavior, or content of our users.

Disputes

If anyone brings a claim against us related to your actions, content or information on SimilarWorlds, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to such claim.  
Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these terms or your use of our platform shall be resolved through good-faith negotiation.

Severability

If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The unenforceable provision shall be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely achieves the intended purpose of the original provision.

Modification of these Terms

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms of Service at any time. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the website or services without notice to you. Please check the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of SimilarWorlds after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes and the updated agreement. If the modified Terms of Service are not acceptable to you, then your only recourse is to discontinue using the website and the services.
