What are cookies, pixels, and local storage?

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your web browser (if you allow that in its settings) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. A cookie contains limited non-personal data, usually a unique identifier, to enable a website to recognise you each time you visit the website again. Cookies are used for a wide variety of purposes such as to keep you logged in or to remember your preferences and settings, to analyse how the site is used by you and to serve advertising to you.  
  
A pixel (also called clear GIF, web beacon, or pixel tag) is a small amount of HTML code on a web page or in an email notification. As many other services do, we use pixels to learn whether you've interacted with a certain email content. This helps us measure and improve our services and personalize your experience on SimilarWorlds.  
  
Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer. We use local storage to help personalize SimilarWorlds. For example, synchronizing data between several open SimilarWorlds tabs/windows on your web browser, making a history of latest Emoji you used, etc...

Do we use cookies?

Yes, just like many other websites.  
We use cookies to personalise content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.  
We use cookies to temporarily save your login information for your own convenience.  
We also use cookies for other special features on SimilarWorlds.

Open Cookie options

Why do we use cookies?

Without cookies, it would be impossible for SimilarWorlds to be secure and effective.  

* **Authentication and Security**  
    SimilarWorlds uses cookies to help authenticate you. This prevents unauthorized parties from accessing your account and helps us remember who you are, so you don't have to login every time you visit a page on SimilarWorlds.  
    Also, cookies protect your security on SimilarWorlds, by making sure it is you and no one else using your account. Cookies are also used to fight spam.
* **Features and Preferences**  
    We use cookies to store your preferences on SimilarWorlds, such as which language have you chosen or what popups have you hidden.  
    Some features may also be driven by cookies.
* **Performance**  
    Cookies are also used for performance. There are some settings or data that we can temporarily store on your computer to make SimilarWorlds pages load faster or even prevent some requests to us, because we know some data hasn't changed.  
    Don't worry, we are very careful with your privacy, so we try our best to not store any personal data on cookies.

Do other parties use cookies in connection with SimilarWorlds?

Yes. Our partners may use cookies to provide services to us, for Advertising purposes.

What is Do Not Track (DNT)?

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal. As we need to use cookies for the purposes explained in this policy, and we do not intentionally track you when you use other websites, SimilarWorlds does not respond to "do not track" signals.
