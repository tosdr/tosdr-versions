Last Updated: October 4, 2024

Protecting your personal information is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we at Fifth Generation, Inc. (“Company”) collect and use personal information when you visit our website(s), browse and shop Tito’s Handmade Vodka® and merchandise, and use our services and applications (the “Services”). By accessing and using our Services, in person and online, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.  

**Overview**

This policy contains important information about our privacy practices. We summarize the key points below:

* **What personal information do we collect?** We collect information such as your name, marketing preferences, purchase history, and activity on our websites.

* **How long do we keep your personal information?** We will delete your information based on our records retention practices, but we may keep it for longer when legally required.
* **What personal information do we sell or share?** We use third-party services that monitor certain activity on our website and across the internet in order to improve our user experience and provide you with useful advertisements. To the extent that the foregoing constitutes selling or sharing your information, we only allow the services to collect the following categories of information: Commercial Information as well as Internet and Electronic Network Activity Information. We also use third-party services to help process customer requests, purchases, transactions, and payments and we share the information necessary to process such customer requests.

**Personal Information Collection**

We collect information directly from you and automatically from your device. We also receive information from social media services, like Facebook, from data brokers or resellers, and from analytics services.

_Information You Provide to Us_

We collect the following categories of personal information:

_Information Collected Automatically_

When you visit or access our Services, your browser automatically sends certain information such as browser type, language preference, operating system, internet service provider, internet protocol (IP) address, device identification number, geo-location data, and online browsing data (such as date and time of access to our website, referring website address, pages viewed, features used, links clicked, and other actions you take in connection with the website, sometimes referred to as “clickstream data”).

**Personal Information Use**

We use your personal information for the following purposes:

* To fulfill or meet the reason the customer provides the information;
* To process customer requests, purchases, transactions, and payments and prevent transactional fraud;
* To provide support, personalize, and develop Company’s website, products, services and advertising;

* As described to consumers when collecting their PI or as otherwise permitted by applicable law;
* To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer in which PI held by Company is among the assets transferred.

We do not use your sensitive personal information, as explained above, for reasons other than those allowed by the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations.

For our visitors to our Services from the United Kingdom or European Economic Area, the law in those areas requires we identify a specific legal basis for processing your information. We rely on one or more of the following bases to carry out the purposes specified above:

* Consent. We may process your personal information after obtaining your consent.
* Contract Performance. We may process your information to carry out our contract with you, such as when you make a purchase through the Services.
* Legitimate Interest. We may process your information when doing so is in our legitimate interests, including for marketing purposes, subject to certain limitations.

**Personal Information Retention**

In general, we keep your information for as long as we need it to carry out the purposes described above and as necessary to comply with our records-management policies. We may keep your information for longer periods when required to comply with our legal obligations, such as in connection with litigation.

**Personal Information Disclosures**

We may disclose your personal data to other companies, including our affiliates or subsidiaries. In the last 12 months, we disclosed identifiers, customer records, commercial information, internet or other similar network activity, and financial details to our vendors. These vendors provide us services, such as helping us process customer requests, purchases, transactions, and payments. We also provided identifiers, customer records, and Commercial information to our marketing affiliate who helps us promote our products. The types of vendors we engage provide us services that include:

* Email Marketing Services
* Analytics Services
* Charitable Donation Requests Services
* Contact Us Form Services
* Web Store Services
* Sweepstakes and Promotions Services
* Advertising, Marketing & Media Services
* Event Registration Services
* Event Photo Booth Services

We may also disclose your information to others: to comply with the law or court orders; to enforce or apply our terms of use, if any, and other agreements; to protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others; in connection with appropriate investigations; and in connection with a corporate reorganization (such as a merger or bankruptcy proceedings).

We do not provide your information to third parties in exchange for money. As discussed more below, however, we allow trusted partners to collect some of your data so they can provide you targeted advertising based on your interactions with us and others online. Some states may consider this practice as us “selling” or “sharing” your information. In the last 12 months, we allowed companies to collect the following categories of personal data for targeted advertising: Commercial Information as well as Internet and Electronic Network Activity Information. Given that we limit our collection of data concerning minors, we do not have actual knowledge that we allowed those companies to collect information on anyone who is younger than 16 years old.

**Use of Cookies**

Like most websites, we also use cookies, which are small text files that our server sends to your browser during your visit to our websites and are stored on your device. We use certain cookies, often provided by third parties, for analytics to help us understand how you interact with our site so we can improve the user experience. For example, we use Google Analytics, which places a cookie on your computer to track your activity on our website and compiles reports for us about our visitors’ activity. You can find more information about Google’s privacy practices and explanation on how they use data by reviewing [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/?_ga=2.139128371.1821204480.1666803816-1445301878.1666018769). You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by installing a browser add-on [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en).

We also allow third parties to collect your information using cookies and other tracking technologies to provide you with relevant advertising. As we noted above, some consider this to constitute targeted advertising (although certain jurisdictions may also refer to it as a sale or sharing of data).

If you do not want us to use your data for targeted advertising, you can choose to opt out by exercising your rights discussed below or changing your browser’s cookie settings. Please note that disabling cookies may mean that certain functionality of the website is also disabled.

_Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control_

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests currently. We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals, which are privacy preferences you can set in your web browser to indicate that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected across websites. For more information, visit [donottrack.us](https://www.donottrack.us/) or [globalprivacycontrol.org](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
