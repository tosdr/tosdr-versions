### Forms

We use forms to facilitate communication and to provide technical support to website visitors. These forms ask for personally identifiable information. Providing your information is completely optional and voluntary on your part. However, this information may be required to comply with any request.

To help prevent fraud and abuse, IP addresses are collected and transmitted by email with the form's contents to our email address. Emails received from form submissions are only retained while relevant to an ongoing request. Information required for accounting and tax purposes will be retained in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws.

In such case that you have submitted a form and would like us to expedite the deletion of your information, you may request all data be permanently deleted. To identify your information, be sure you provide either a matching IP address or email address so that we may identify your information to be provided to you or deleted and select to delete or provide you with your information. To receive an export of your data, we may require you to verify both a matching email address and IP address.

If you have submitted personal information on this website, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you.
