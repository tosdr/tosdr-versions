2\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, HOW WE USE IT, AND WHY WE SHARE IT

The chart below describes what personal data we collect about our users, how we collect or access it, how we use it, which third parties have access to it, and the purpose for disclosure. In addition, we may collect, use and disclose your personal data as required or permitted by applicable law, as directed by you, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

| **Categories of Personal Data** | **How we collect it** | **How we use it** | **Who has access** | **Purpose for disclosure** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Your IP address** | We automatically collect the IP address you use each time you visit our Sites. We get this information from your browser when it interacts with our servers. We log these IP addresses in our user visit logs. | This is to determine what country or state or province you are in to show you relevant search results, content, and ads. This is also to analyze fraudulent traffic patterns. We also analyze which regions of the world our users come from so we can develop search and content offerings for these regions. | Our vendors receive your IP address and Browser ID to provide to us a variety of services to help our Sites function, such as site hosting, data warehousing, content delivery, Site functionalities (video, push notifications), Site content, security, privacy tools, and analytics (such as Google Analytics - for more information visit: [How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services – Privacy & Terms](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) and to opt out of [Google Analytics cookies, visit: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on Download Page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)). Our marketing agencies may also have access to your IP address while promoting our Sites on our behalf. Your IP address may also incidentally be accessed by vendors for IT support, data backup and recovery services, and office software. We also provide this data to our parent company IAC. | Our vendors process this data to:<br><br>1. Provide their services to us and to determine what amounts are owed to them based on traffic and app install volumes or other metrics<br>2. Log page impressions and user actions for their business analytics<br>3. Detect and address fraudulent behavior or illegal activity<br>4. Monitor the proper functioning of their services, quality assurance, find errors and fix them<br>5. Internal research<br>6. Improve their products and services<br><br>Such vendors may also engage their own vendors to help them process user personal data, so they can provide their services to us. IAC processes IP address data for security purposes. IAC analyzes all traffic patterns from all IAC group companies for Site security and fraud prevention. |
| **A unique ID assigned to your browser** | We attribute a unique ID to your browser for each of our Sites that you visit (Browser ID). We store this information in a cookie set on your browser.<br><br>Every time you visit the same Site with the same browser, we recognize you as the same visitor through your Browser ID. If you use a different device or a different browser, or if you visit a different Site with the same browser, you will be identified as a different user with a different Browser ID. | This is so we can count unique users and repeat users for each of our Sites. We can determine which of our Sites receive more repeat visits and which type of content causes users to come back to the Sites. |
| **Data collected via third party cookies** | We implement on our Sites certain code provided by partners such as a pixel or beacon that enable them to place or recognize a cookie on your browser or other tracking device (for example, tied to your mobile device ID).

For information about opting out of tracking via cookies by these partners, see [REGIONAL SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES](#3) and [YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES](#5). | Ad partners use tracking technology to place ads on our Sites and other websites and applications targeted to you based on your past actions on our Site or on other websites (interest based advertising).<br><br>Ad networks where we promote our Sites collect information about you to provide promotion campaign optimization services to us.<br><br>Ad partners and ad networks also use cookies to develop their own ad targeting algorithms and help other advertisers optimize their campaigns.<br><br>They may also combine information about your activities on our Sites with information about you from other sources not affiliated with us. These partners may also use cookie data to determine payments owed to them, analyze fraudulent traffic patterns, detect and fix errors in their service, and to conduct internal research to improve their service and increase their revenues. |
| **Additional Information when you install one of our applications** | If you install a browser extension, an installation ID will be created and tied to your Browser ID.<br><br>If you install one of our mobile applications, we will receive the unique identifier (“ID”) that is tied to your app store account ID (such as Google Play or Amazon Appstore). | This enables us to understand how many users are visiting our Sites via browser extensions or mobile applications.<br><br>It also enables us to understand where you were coming from before installing our apps in order to compensate our marketing partners for referrals to our application install pages. | N/A | N/A |
| **Your activities on our Sites** | All of your actions on each of our Sites (your visits, search queries, search results you click on, URL of the webpage you were last visiting before clicking to our Site, pages viewed, any installation of a browser extension or mobile app, comments posted-where applicable, duration of visit) are logged and tied to your Browser ID. Your browser has a different Browser ID for each of our Sites.<br><br>If you use our mobile apps, some of your activities (installs, uninstalls, bookmarks, adding to device home screen, use of new tabs) may be tied to your unique app ID, which may include a Google Advertising ID or Amazon Advertising ID respectively. | This is to count search queries, clicks, page views, repeat visits, time on Site and in apps, and other metrics so we can determine which search queries are trending, which content, web page layouts or user interfaces are the most popular or generates the most revenue and which app features are the most used<br><br>This is also to determine payments owed to content and advertising partners, as well as marketing agencies. | Advertisers and digital advertising technology intermediaries who place interest based advertisements on our Sites, advertising networks where we promote our Sites, service providers who help us optimize our advertising campaigns (such as retargeting companies), and social media platforms. | As explained above in the **Data collected via third party cookies** row of this chart. |
| **Other technical information** | As you interact with the Sites, we collect information about your computer or mobile device such as type of device, mobile device ID number, screen resolution, web browser information and operating system or platform.

| **Contact information you may submit via our HelpDesk** | When you fill out a form to contact us via our [HelpDesk](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us), we retain your request and any other information you provide. We do not combine this information with any of your other data collected through our Sites and keep it in a separate database. | This is used only to respond to your [HelpDesk](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us) request.

Your right to know. Upon your request, and provided you are able to provide to us your Browser ID, then we may provide you with certain limited information:

* The types of personal data that may have been collected by third parties when you visited our Site, and the categories of third parties who may have collected such information.

Your Right to delete. Upon your request to delete or if you withdraw the consent that you have previously provided to us to store or use your personal data, and provided you are able to provide to us your Browser ID, then we will delete any personal data we have stored about you.

You also have the right to obtain a transportable copy of such Personal Information. Requests of this nature may be made no more than twice in a 12-month period. Please note that we retain Personal Information for various time periods in accordance with applicable law and our internal recordkeeping policies and procedures.

* The categories of Personal Information we disclosed about you for a Business Purpose and the Categories of Third Parties to which it was disclosed

See [HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS](#4) for more details.

Right to request deletion of Personal Information. You may request that we delete the Personal Information that we have Collected directly from you and are currently maintaining. Please note, however, that we may have a legal basis for retaining certain Personal Information under the CCPA, despite your request.

Right to correct Personal Information. While California residents also have a right to correct inaccuracies in their Personal Information, such rights cannot be exercised with us because we do not have a way of authenticating or verifying the identity of our users and so we cannot adequately verify that the requester is the same person as the user whose data correction is being requested. See [HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS](#4) for more details.

Right to limit use of your sensitive Personal Information. We do not process sensitive personal information. For this reason, we do not offer a way for you to submit such a request.

Right to non-discrimination for the exercise of your privacy rights. We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise any of the privacy rights described above.

You have the right to opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of your Personal Information in the context of cookies or other tracking technologies.

We do not knowingly Sell or Share the personal data of individuals under the age of 16.

#### III. Shine the Light

California law permits customers in California to request certain details about how their personal information is shared with third parties if personal information is shared for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes.

4\. HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS

Exercising Right of Access, Correction or Portability. We do not collect sufficient personal data to authenticate any particular user. As indicated above in [INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, HOW WE USE IT, AND WHY WE SHARE IT](#2), we only recognize a unique browser based on the Browser ID we assign to that browser for a particular Site. A Browser ID could therefore correspond to multiple individuals. Since the personal data we collect related to a Browser ID is not sufficient to verify that the corresponding browser belongs to the person making the request, we are not able to provide certain information in response to a request to know, access or port specific personal information about a user. This is to prevent anyone from using your browser to obtain your search or browsing history. We want to make sure your search and browsing history does not fall into the wrong hands.

Exercising Other Rights: Residents of the EEA, UK, California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah can request to access, delete, restrict use of their personal data by following these steps:

1. Click on the Browser ID button below to get your Browser ID and copy your Browser ID to a safe place so you can later send it to us. Remember that this Browser ID is unique to this Site. If you visit a different Site with the same browser, you will be identified as a different user with a different Browser ID.

3. Fill out this [form](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=11242625116564) and select the correct topic or request from the drop down menus.
4. Provide your Browser ID number in the Description field.
5. Confirm that:
    1. You are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, the UK, or a country in the EEA (please indicate which country); and
    2. You are the rightful owner of the browser that corresponds to the Browser ID you are providing.
6. Add any clarification as appropriate in the Description field.
7. To assist us in processing your request in a timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so.

All requests will be reviewed by our legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding any requests. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, as permitted by the applicable laws of your country or state, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.

5\. YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

You have choices regarding our collection and use of your personal data, as well as the collection and use of some of our third party partners

Removing our cookie. If you remove our Browser ID cookie from your browser cache, we will no longer recognize your browser and activities until a new cookie is placed. Any future Site activities you perform after you delete this cookie will not be tied to your previous activities which were associated with the removed cookie.

Removing Interest based advertising cookies. You can opt-out of third-party interest-based, advertising-related cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, to prevent our advertising partners to deliver targeted interest based ads to you. You can choose to opt-out through these (and other) resources:

* [Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/)
* [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/consumers)
* [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

You will continue to see advertisements on our Sites, but they will not be tailored to you based on any past behavior on our Sites or other websites. You may, however, still receive customized content and/or ads based on the search queries you submitted or the content of the pages you are visiting.

Removing Interest-based advertising from Mobile Tracking Devices. You may opt out of tracking and receiving tailored advertisements on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other similar entities by [downloading the App Choices app](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices).

Other Privacy Tools. In addition, third party tools enable you to search for and opt-out of some of these devices, such as the [Ghostery browser plug-in](https://www.ghostery.com/).

Do Not Track. Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.

Deletion of information you submit via our HelpDesk. You may request us to delete all the information you submitted to us via our [HelpDesk](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us) by contacting us via our HelpDesk. However, we reserve the right to retain any information you provided via our HelpDesk in order to defend legal claims, retain a record of our compliance with laws, including privacy and data protection laws, and other statutory data retention requirements. Note that except when you provide your Browser ID via a HelpDesk request, your HelpDesk request information is not tied to your Browser ID. Deleting your [HelpDesk](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us) request information will not automatically delete from our systems all personal data we have relating to your activities on our Sites and you must make these requests separately.

6\. DATA HOSTED IN THE UNITED STATES

Ask Media Group is headquartered in California, and in order to access our Sites, your browser interacts directly with our Site servers in the United States. By visiting or using our Sites, your data is automatically collected, processed and stored on servers located in the United States. If you are located in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Switzerland, or the European Economic Area (“EEA”), this means your data is stored in a country with laws that may offer less personal data protection than your country. We however comply with requirements set forth in the EU General Data Protection Regulation when we process your data, and you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data supervisory authority of your country if you feel that we have unlawfully processed your data.

7\. NON DISCRIMINATION, COMPLAINTS AND DISPUTES

All content and services offered on the Sites are free of charge and Ask Media Group will not discriminate against any user who has exercised their rights as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal data. Inquiries, concerns or complaints may be submitted to us [here](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000386952). We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about your privacy. If, however, you believe that we have not satisfactorily addressed your complaint or concern, you may have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your state of residence.

8\. DATA RETENTION AND SECURITY

We have designed our Browser ID system so that we can manage our Sites while collecting as little information about our users as possible. We generally retain the information tied to your Browser ID for a period of fourteen (14) months, unless necessary for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements for example to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We retain information in our [HelpDesk](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us) system for up to three years to respond to discovery requests in the event of litigation or have the ability to defend legal claims.

We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.

9\. UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND CONTACT INFORMATION

We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, applicable laws, business practices, and our user’s needs, and may make changes accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any changes to this notice we will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page and update the effective date. Except in connection with updates that materially change the ways in which we process your information, your continued use of the services after this Privacy Policy has been updated means that you agree to be bound by such updates.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the manner in which your information is processed (or if you are an EEA resident, how your data is transferred outside of the EEA), or if you would like to submit a request to us, please contact our Data Protection Officer [here](https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000386952) or via mail at:
