Privacy Policy

Prulu, Inc. ("Prulu" or "we") has created this privacy policy ("Policy") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on our Site and in providing our Service is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers (collectively, "Users"), we have established this Policy as a means to communicate our information-gathering and dissemination practices.  
  
By using or accessing our Site and using the Service, you agree to our privacy policy outlined here.  
  
We are dedicated to establishing a relationship of trust with our Users, based on respect for personal identity and information and by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy policy covers all web properties owned and maintained by us, including but not limited www.Prulu.com (collectively, the "Site") and the Service. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to our Users' privacy, we are disclosing:

* What information we collect.
* How we use the information, and with whom we share User Information.
* What choices are available to Users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information, and how Users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
* What types of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.

Disclaimer
----------

We are only responsible, on a limited basis, for our proprietary applications provided to our Users as part of the Service. We are not responsible for information accessed through our Service or open-source or third-party applications provided with the Service. We specifically disclaim any responsibility for User Content – please see "User Content" below.  
  

Regarding Children
------------------

We do not intentionally gather personal information from anyone under the age of 13, or knowingly allow such persons to register as Users. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at [team@Prulu.com](mailto:team@Prulu.com).  
  
  

COLLECTION OF USER INFORMATION

We collect two types of information from our Users: Personal Information and Anonymous Information. "Personal Information" means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Information" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons.  
  
We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Information in the following ways:  
  

Information You Provide to Us
-----------------------------

When you register as a User of the Service, you are required to give Personal Information (such as full name, profile photo, email address, and your registration in a particular class at a particular University), and a unique identifier (password). You might also provide Personal Information if you provide us feedback or otherwise contact us via e-mail. We collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as operating system and version and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.  
  
In addition, your participation on Prulu will also produce information that will be personally identifiable, such as the questions and answers you post and what times you participate on Prulu.  
  
To provide the Services, we might require you (a) to provide Personal Data about yourself and (b) to provide Personal Data about other users. **You represent and warrant that your provision to us of such Personal Data does not violate any provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA").**  
  

Surveys
-------

Occasionally, we request information from Users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use or and satisfaction with the Service. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, we require that they not use Users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  
  

User Content
------------

When you post messages on the message boards of our Site will automatically post with your name. The information contained in your posting, including any Personal Information, will be stored on our servers and other Users will be able to see it. Please see "User Content" below.  
  

Information Provided by the University or Instructor
----------------------------------------------------

Your University or your Instructor may also provide us with your name, email address, and other information when enrolling you in a Class on the Service.  
  

Information Collected via Technology
------------------------------------

Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect Anonymous Information and Personal Information from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (which might vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.  
  

Cookies
-------

We may receive data from our Users as part of the communication connection itself, that is, the standard electronic greeting between the User's computer or mobile device and our servers. This information often consists of network routing, equipment information (device or browser type), location, date and time. We use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.  
  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. Standing alone, cookies do not identify the User personally; they merely recognize the User's browser. The only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information the User supplies. A cookie can't read data off the User's hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.  
  
Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from the User's computer when he closes his browser software or turns off his computer. Persistent cookies remain on the User's computer after he has closed his browser or turned off his computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for the User's browser. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Site may not work properly.  
  
We use session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify the User while he is logged in. This information allows us to process our Users' online transactions and requests, to enhance security and to improve the functionality of the Site by avoiding duplicate data entry, and facilitating navigation. Session cookies help us make sure the User is who he says he is after he has logged in and are required in order to use the Service. We use persistent cookies, which only we can read and use, to identify the fact that the User is a Prulu User or prior visitor to our Site, as the case may be. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store passwords in persistent cookies.  
  
While we do not offer an opt-out on the Site for cookies, browsers provide you with information about and control over cookies. If you disable your web browser's ability to accept cookies, your access to and usage of the Service could be denied.  
  

Log Files
---------

When you use the Service, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. In addition, we use log files to track data stored using the Service to the appropriate User. Except for the purpose of tracking Users' message posting frequency, and other information required to enhance your usage of the Service, information gathered from log files, such as IP addresses, are not linked to Personal Information.  
  

Clear Gifs
----------

We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) to track the online usage patterns of our Users. This information is Anonymous Information; no Personal Information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make the Service better for our Users.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our Users. We will not, under any circumstances, rent, sell, or give away Personal Information, nor will we trade or exchange mailing lists with any other organization. We will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of Personal Information.  
  
However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your Personal Information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.

Users may opt-out of receiving many of such notices. Please see the "Opt-out" section below.  
  

Service Announcements
---------------------

We communicate with Users on a regular basis to provide requested support services and regarding issues relating to their accounts.

FERPA
-----

Certain information about Users who are students is contained in records maintained by us and that this information can be confidential by reason of FERPA and related University policies unless valid consent is obtained from the University's students or their legal guardians. We will protect these records in accordance with FERPA and University policy. The University will advise us when any Users have provided consent to release information to an extent broader than as provided for by FERPA or University policy.  
  

Disclosure of Anonymous Information to Third Parties
----------------------------------------------------

We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable.

We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Data to third parties at our discretion.
