15. Interest Charges.



When Interest Charges Begin; Grace Periods for New Purchases Only. We calculate interestcharges separately for Cash Advances and Purchases. There are no grace periods for CashAdvances, so you will pay interest charges on Cash Advances beginning on the transaction dateuntil they are paid in full.

There is a grace period during which no interest charge will be imposed on Purchases appearingon a billing statement for the first time (“New Purchases”). New Purchases will not be subject toan interest charge if you pay the New Balance reflected on the current billing statement (thestatement reflecting the New Purchases) in full by the Payment Due Date reflected on the currentbilling statement. If you do not pay the New Balance reflected on the current billing statement in

12

full by the Payment Due Date reflected on the current billing statement, the balance of the NewPurchases that is not paid by the Payment Due Date on the current billing statement will besubject to an interest charge from the first day of the Billing Cycle beginning immediately afterthe Billing Cycle in which the New Purchases were posted to your Card Account.

(a) How We Calculate Your Interest on Purchases: Average Daily Balance Method (Excluding NewPurchases). We calculate a portion of the interest charge on your Card Account by applying a DailyPeriodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance of Purchases (excluding New Purchases)” on yourCard Account. The “Daily Periodic Rate” is determined by dividing the Annual Percentage Rate by365 (or by 366 in a leap year). The current Daily Periodic Rate is 0.0629%.To get the Average DailyBalance of Purchases, we take the beginning balance of Purchases on your Card Account each day;and subtract unpaid interest or other finance charges and any payments or credits and fees (NewPurchases are not included in the calculation of the Average Daily Balance of Purchases for theBilling Cycle in which those Purchases are made). This gives us the Daily Balance of Purchases.Then we add together all of these Daily Balances of Purchases for the Billing Cycle, and divide thetotal by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance ofPurchases.

(b) How We Calculate Your Interest on Cash Advances: Average Daily Balance Method (IncludingNew Cash Advances). We calculate a portion of the interest charge on your Card Account byapplying a Daily Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including New CashAdvances)” on your Card Account. The “Daily Periodic Rate” is determined by dividing the AnnualPercentage Rate by 365 (or by 366 in a leap year). The current Daily Periodic Rate is 0.074%. Toget the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advanceson the Card Account each day; add any new Cash Advances that have a transaction date thatoccurred on that day; and subtract unpaid interest or other finance charges and any payments orcredits and fees. This gives us the Daily Balance of Cash Advances. Then we add together all ofthese Daily Balances of Cash Advances for the Billing Cycle, and divide the total by the number ofdays in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances.
