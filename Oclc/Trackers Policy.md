OCLC uses cookies to remember your preferences, make our websites function effectively (such as arranging the content and layout of our websites), to collect information about the use of our websites, and to improve our website visitors' experiences.

A cookie can be either a session cookie or a persistent cookie. A session cookie is a temporary cookie that is erased from your device when you close your web browser. A persistent cookie is a cookie that continues to be stored on your device for a set duration after you close your web browser.

Cookies can also be first-party or third-party. A first-party cookie is a cookie directly from OCLC and its affiliates. A third-party cookie is a cookie from another company. For example, third-party cookies may include cookies from data analytics and social media companies.
