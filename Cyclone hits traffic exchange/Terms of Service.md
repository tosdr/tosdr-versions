Cyclone Hits Teams
------------------

Team Leaders can decide who they let in to their team, whether to go private or public, and what kind of rules they want to impose. At any time, they can remove a member from their team.  
  
At the end of each month the top 3 teams for the following categories will split the jackpot: "Top Overall Surfing", "Top Average Surfing" and "Top Referring".  
  
In the event of a tie, the winnings for the category will be split between the number of teams that are tied for that spot.

Viewing Other Members Offers (Surfing) & Activity Policy
--------------------------------------------------------

The use of programs or "bots" to automatically surf at Cyclone Hits without clicking is strictly prohibited, and any member who is found using such a program will be suspended. This also applies to members who let someone else log into their account to surf.  
  
Using several windows to surf faster than your timer allows or to save time is strictly prohibited, and any member who is found doing so will be suspended.  
  
Falling below 85% accurate clicks will auto-suspend your account. If this happens and you're a new member and just started surfing, just send a support ticket and I will fix it, but members who have surfed a lot will be suspended if this happens.  
  
Surfing in a minimized window is not allowed and will cause a pop up at each click.  
  
From time-to-time you may receive bonuses from different games and contest on this site, including Team Surfing, which can only be used for onsite purchases such as Account Upgrades or buying Advertising Credits. There are no cashout payments on these types of activities.  
  
For free members, after 90 days of inactivity credits and impressions that are not assigned will be lost. Upgrading or surfing within 90 days will prevent loss in credits. Accounts older than 90 days will be "suspended". You may "reactivate" your account at any time by submitting a support ticket.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW RULES
-----------------------

If your site or account fails to follow any of the rules listed in our Terms and Policies, your account will be removed. All credits, impressions, commissions or rewards of any kind will be lost. Your banners and urls will be removed, and your downline will be lost.

Promoting Cyclone Hits in a way that could be considered spamming will result in removal of your Cyclone Hits account and possible legal action.

**CHAT, PM, and FORUM SPAM**

Cyclone Hits does not permit using the forum, chat, or private messaging system for sending advertisements. Members found using these services to send spam, ask users to join programs, bait members into asking for more information, or in any way using these services for promotion may find their access to the forum, PM system, and chat revoked.

Purchases of Goods & Services
-----------------------------

Cyclone Hits uses third party payment processors for taking payments and we are not part of the Payment Processors company nor can we accept any loss or damage for their use. For this reason we do not store any payment infomation and all payments are collected via the processor and our scripts alerted to update your account.  
  
If you have any issue with any purchase from Cyclone Hits please submit us a support ticket and we will try to work with you to come to a satisfactory conclusion. Initiating a chargeback, refund request, not as described or item not received dispute without first contacting us using our support desk and giving us 5 days to reply will result in immediate suspension of your account. Those are not ways to mutually resolve issues and should only be used as a last result for example awol admin for a long period of time. Having your account removed for breach of these terms may also result in the loss of your accounts at all sites associated with us as well as selected other sites that we work with to share false dispute information and bad practices.  
  
Any special offers are for a limited time only and can be withdrawn from the system at any time. (including before any advertised offer end date if need be).  
  
You agree that all details that you provide for the purpose of ordering or purchasing goods are correct, that any credit or debit card you are using is your own and that there are sufficient funds to cover the costs of the products you are purchasing.  
  
We reserve the right to hold or withdraw any payment you make to us if we are investigating your account with us for wrongful use.  
  
We reserve the right to change upgrade benefits during the life of your upgrade. When we do this we do it to better the site and where possible we always try to improve the offer to upgraded members. However please note you are purchasing a upgraded account level and not any one benefit.  
  
**Please note:** you are purchasing membership account and not results. We cannot and do not guarantee any results from using our methods of advertising, websites and services. All we can do is display your offers. It is up to you to provide the content and offer services/products that sell in today's market environment.  
  
**Affiliate Commissions:** cash payouts are **only** for purchases made by your direct referrals and subject to a holding period for verification of payment received on those purchases.

Refund Policy
-------------

We offer a digital product. Delivery of your purchased product will be immediate, thus there are **NO REFUNDS** offered. If you are not happy with our any of our products, contact us through the support system.  
  
Buying another type of upgrade before your current upgrade runs out will not make you eligible to get a refund or prorated refund for the current one.  
  
Should you choose to delete your account while still having an active upgrade, you will not be able to get a refund. It is not possible for you to delete your account by mistake or by having your account hacked into and deleted by another person (see the bottom of Profile in the navigation menu for information on how to delete your account).  
  
Should you start a new account after deleting your old upgraded account you can not transfer the previous upgrade to the new account.  
  
It is your responsibility to cancel any active upgrade subscriptions in your payment processor account before the payment processing date if you chose not to continue your upgrade or paid subscription. Commissions are instantly transferred to your upline, so if you forget to cancel your subscription, you cannot request a refund.  
  
If you use e-checks, bank transfers or other payment methods that fail or bounce, your account will be stripped of all earnings and you may be suspended.  
  
Cash signup bonuses, if any, not used or cashed out within one year will be forfeited.

Questions/Comments/Concerns or How To Reach Us
----------------------------------------------

We provide a support desk as a first point of contact for any account issues. Please always submit a support ticket and note down the ticket number so you can return to check for a reply.

Any support ticket submitted in a non-professional and courteous manner will not be replied to, remember we are here to help and work with you not to be subjected to abuse. Please do not reply to emails with support questions as we get so many emails it will most likely never be seen.
