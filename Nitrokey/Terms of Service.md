Commercial registry: Amtsgericht Potsdam  
Commercial Register Number: HRB 32882 P  
VAT ID: DE300136599,

hereinafter referred to as the provider.

Purpose of the Contract
-----------------------

This contract governs the sale of new hardware, software, and service products via the provider's online shop. The details of the respective offer are found in the product description posted online.

Entering Into a Contract
------------------------

The contract is created as part of an electronic transaction started via the online shop system or via other forms of long-distance communication such as telephone or email. The products and prices offered on the site represent a non-binding solicitation of the customer to submit a binding offer to purchase a product (the "order"), which the provider is free to accept or reject. The ordering process in the shop system that leads to the creation of a contract comprises the following steps:

* product selection in the desired model and quantity;
* placing the product in the shopping cart;
* clicking the checkout button;
* entering the billing and delivery address;
* selecting the payment and delivery methods;
* confirming the entries by clicking "Buy now";
* receiving an email confirming that the order has been received.

In addition to placing orders via the online shop system, orders can also be placed via long-distance communication (phone/email), for which the order process that leads to the creation of a contract would comprise the following steps:

* calling the order hotline or send order by email;
* receiving an email confirming that the order has been received.

The order confirmation indicates that the order has been accepted and a contract has been created.

Contract Term
-------------

Unless terminated, the contract shall last until such time as the single delivery is made. The total price is calculated on the goods ordered and the chosen shipping method.

Retention of Title
------------------

The standard delivery time depends on the delivery address and the shipping service provider used. The provider will ship the order from its warehouse when the entire order is available to ship. If the provider is encountering a continuing obstacle to delivery that is beyond its control, in particular one caused by force majeure or a failure of its suppliers to make deliveries as promised, the provider is entitled to withdraw from the contract with the customer. The customer will be informed immediately and any payments or other benefits received will be refunded.

Warranty
--------

If the customer is an entrepreneur, the warranty period is limited to one year for new goods. The provider is entitled to choose between repair and replacement if the product is new when shipped and the customer is an entrepreneur. This does not apply to claims for damages asserted by the customer due to injury to life, limb, health or breaches of essential contractual obligations, which must be met for the contract's purpose to be fulfilled. Likewise, this does not apply to claims for damages based on the gross negligence or intentional breach of duty by the provider, its legal representatives or agents. Otherwise, the statutory provisions apply.

Contract Structure
------------------

If the customer is an entrepreneur, the risk of accidental loss and/or damage to the goods transfers to the customer upon delivery in person or when the goods are handed over to the selected shipping company for delivery. The text of this contract will be archived by the provider. The customer has the option for accessing the contract text stored at www.nitrokey.com publicly. The customer can correct errors made when completing the ordering process by proceeding as follows: by clicking the "Change Address" button or by hitting back in the browser to the respective input step.

Right of Withdrawal
-------------------

For customers who are entrepreneurs, the rules for distance sales contracts do not apply. Therefore, such customers do not have a corresponding right to withdraw this distance sales contract. The provider will not grant such a right.

Liability for Defects
---------------------

Regulation for the sale of used goods: Warranty claims arising after one year after delivery of the goods are excluded. Defects which occur within one year of delivery of the goods can be asserted within the statutory period applicable to consumers (applicable for commercial customers too). In all other respects, the statutory liability for defects shall apply.

Liability Disclaimer
--------------------

Customer claims for damages are excluded, unless for reasons otherwise stated below. This also applies to the representatives and agents of the provider, if the customer asserts such claims for damages. This does not apply to claims for damages asserted by the customer due to injury to life, limb, health or breaches of essential contractual obligations, which must be met for the contract's purpose to be fulfilled. Likewise, this does not apply to claims for damages based on the gross negligence or intentional breach of duty by the provider, its legal representatives or agents.

Mentioning of Customers
-----------------------

If the customer is an entrepreneur, the provider reserves the option to mention the customer publicly. The customer can opt out from the public announcement at anytime.

Language, Jurisdiction and Applicable Law
-----------------------------------------

The contract will be drafted in German. All correspondence related to the fulfilment of the contract will also be in German. This agreement is governed exclusively by the law of the Federal Republic of Germany.
