By using our Services, you agree to our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.southwest.com/about-southwest/terms-and-conditions/) and consent to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations.

1\. Transfer of Information
---------------------------

The information we collect from you may be transferred to, stored at, and processed in destinations outside of the country in which you are located, and may be accessible to the governments of such destinations. This includes processing by us, our affiliates, our third party payment processing companies and other third parties described in the “Sharing of Information” section below. You agree to such transfer, storing and/or processing outside the country in which you are located. It is our objective to take steps reasonably necessary to help secure your information and to treat your information that we have collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

[Back to Top](#top)  

2\. Information Collection
--------------------------

**Information You Provide to Us**

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you use our Services, book travel, register for our Services or set up a Southwest account, SWABIZ® account, or Rapid Rewards® account, subscribe to our e-mails, mobile messages, or social media notifications, post on our forums or blogs, participate in the Rapid Rewards® Program, a sweepstakes, contest, promotion, survey, or poll, communicate with us via third party social media sites, shop our Services, order physical or digital gift cards, request customer support, apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us through the Services.

The types of information we may collect include Personal Information. "Personal Information" is information that could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, zip code, billing address, shipping address, phone number, payment card information, social media account information, travel preferences, birth date, redress number, and demographic information. “Personal Information” also may include sensitive information, such as present and future health status, and genetic information, to allow us to better serve your needs (for example, to assist you with boarding a flight if you need a wheelchair or with meeting safety requirements).

You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us through the Services, including Personal Information, but you are solely responsible for the information that you submit to us.

If you apply for or inquire about employment with us, “Personal Information” may also include your education, occupation, and employment history.

This information may also include clickstream data, which is information about the page-by-page paths you take as you browse through the Services.

This information is gathered by certain tools and methods such as:

* Log Information: We and our agents, vendors, and service providers collect information about your use of our Services, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the referring link through which you accessed our Services.
* Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We and our agents, vendors, and service providers may use cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our Services or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We and our agents, vendors, and service providers may combine this information with other information about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our Services and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our Services are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring communications with you, determining whether an e-mail has been opened and/or links within the e-mail have been clicked, and for other internal business purposes.

* Cookies: Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a website. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences or web pages visited while using our Services. Some web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject certain cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For example, cookies allow us and our agents, vendors, and service providers to store items in your cart between visits. In addition, please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, some preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
* Web Beacons: We and our agents, vendors, and service providers may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages and e-mail messages. We and our agents, vendors, and service providers may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to our Service, to monitor how users navigate the Services, and to count how many e-mails that we sent were actually opened or how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
* Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is designed to be active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
* Location-identifying Technologies: We and our agents, vendors, and service providers may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies to locate you so we may verify your location, and deliver relevant content to you based on your location. We may collect precise location information from your device.
* In-App Tracking Methods: There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app.

Information we and our agents, vendors, and service providers automatically collect about you, such as how you interact with our Services, may be combined with your Personal Information. If we associate any such automatically-collected information with Personal Information about you, our objective will be to treat the combined information as Personal Information.

[Back to Top](#top)  

7\. Advertising & Analytics Services and Online Tracking
--------------------------------------------------------

We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics about the use of our Services. In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to our Services visitors based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the Service and certain third party sites participating in the same networks and exchanges. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Service, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Services and other websites and better understand your online activity. Data collected from a particular browser or device may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which such data was collected, or transferred to a non-affiliate for such purposes.

This means that some information about your browsing of the Service and certain third party sites may be shared with these companies for the purpose of delivering ads to you on the Services and certain third party sites, and Southwest may receive from some of these companies information about third party sites that you have visited. This information is used for marketing purposes and the practice is sometimes termed "retargeting" to indicate that information from one retailer is used to suggest to you relevant products offered by another retailer.

These and other third parties may also collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Service.

We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on other websites or platforms.

This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties themselves may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).

Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. Like many websites and online services, Southwest currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com.](http://allaboutdnt.com/?clk=1725000)

Certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at [http://www.youradchoices.com](https://youradchoices.com/?clk=1725000). The DAA also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising. To exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download the AppChoice app at [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices.](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices?clk=1725000)

In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific and your preferences are deleted whenever you clear your cookies or browser’s cache.

Southwest also has a specific marketing platform that uses persistent cookies. [Click this link to opt out from our marketing platform’s persistent cookies](https://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/terms-and-conditions/cookies-opt-out.html?clk=1725000) (please note that if you delete your cookies or switch to a different browser you will have to repeat this procedure). Use of cookies by Southwest’s marketing platform is subject to its privacy policies. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive generic ads.

8\. Social Features
-------------------

Certain functionality on the Services is specifically designed to permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and third party websites or services, including third party social networks (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to transmit content to the Service from your account on a third party website or service; to “like” or “share” our Services content to other websites or services; to log-in to the Services using your username and password for a third party site or service; and to otherwise connect our Services to a third party website or service.

If you choose to use Social Features, information you post or provide access to, including User Content, may be publicly displayed on our Services or by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references our Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Southwest in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on our Service in accordance with the terms of the third party website or service. Also, both Southwest and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of our Services and the third party site or service. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web pages, profile pages, or similar pages on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.

The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third parties remains subject to those third parties’ privacy practices, including whether the third parties continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on those third party websites or services.

9\. Refer-a-Friend
------------------

You may use a referral feature to inform a friend about our services. Southwest may use any e-mail address provided when using this referral feature to send a single e-mail to such designated recipients about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events and provide news and information we think will be of interest to such designated recipients. By using a referral feature, you represent that you and your friend are United States citizens and that you have permission to provide your friend’s email address. Southwest will not be responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide.

10\. Third Party Websites
-------------------------

The Services contain hyperlinks to other websites or locations that we do not control and are operated and controlled by third parties ("Third Party Websites"). We make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of such Third Party Websites and encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing them with your Personal Information. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these Third Party Websites. You should read the privacy policy of each Third Party Website as these Third Party Websites may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to independently collect information about you. In addition, these Third Party Websites may solicit Personal Information from you.

11\. TSA Guidelines
-------------------

The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires us to collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice.
