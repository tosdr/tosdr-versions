Information Collected By Washburn Law
-------------------------------------

Washburn Law is committed to protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy. As part of the operation of washburnlaw.edu, we gather certain types of information about our users. We would like to explain the types of information we gather and what we do with it.

Washburn Law collects two types of identifying information from users: personal data that users supply to us voluntarily (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on washburnlaw.edu).

Personal Data
-------------

Personal data is collected when users voluntarily provide data to Washburn Law through one of the web site forms, such as when requesting [admissions information](https://www.washburnlaw.edu/admissions/getpacket/index.php "Go the the request an admissions packet form."), or by directly sending an email to a Washburn Law employee or department. Your information from these forms will be used to execute the immediate transaction, and will be provided to other parties only as necessary to complete your transaction. In addition, we may store your information locally in order to facilitate contact with you in the future. Note that in some instances you will not be able to submit a form unless you are willing to provide all requested information. Washburn Law will not provide any of your personal information to third parties without your permission, unless compelled by law or court order to do so, and will not sell any personal information to third parties for purposes of marketing, advertising, or promotion.

When you visit washburnlaw.edu, we collect certain types of information that does not identify individual users. This information is aggregated with hundreds of thousands of other pieces of information to create summary statistics that help us determine which information is of most interest to users, to improve the web site, to identify system problem areas, to carry out other administrative tasks, or to help determine technical requirements.

Information collected includes:

* Hostname: the hostname, site name, username, and IP address of the computer requesting access to the site.
* User-Agent: the type of browser, its version, and the operating system of the computer requesting access (e.g., Netscape 4 for Windows, IE 4 for Macintosh, etc.).
* Referrer: the web page the user came from.
* System date: the date and time on the server at the time of access.
* Full request: the exact request the user made.
* Status: the status code the server returned, e.g., fulfilled request, file not found, etc.
* Content length: the size, in bytes, of the file sent to the user.
* Method: the request method used by the browser (e.g., post, get).
* Universal Resource Identifier (URI): the location of the particular resource requested. (More commonly known as a URL.)
* Query string of the URI: anything after a question mark in a URI. For example, if a keyword search has been requested, the search word will appear in the query string.
* Protocol: the technical protocol and version used, i.e., http 1.0, ftp, etc.

The above information is not used in any way that would reveal personally identifying information to outside parties unless Washburn Law is legally required to do so.
