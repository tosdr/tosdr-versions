Terms of Service
================

Last Updated: January 28, 2021

THESE TERMS OF SERVICE SET FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT APPLY TO YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICE LICENSED BY BILLGO. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY – ALONG WITH BILLGO’S PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY SUBSCRIPTION DOCUMENT BETWEEN YOU AND BILLGO – FORM THE LEGAL “AGREEMENT” BETWEEN YOU AND BILLGO AND CONTAIN IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS AND WAIVERS WITH REGARD TO YOUR RIGHTS.

FOR EXAMPLE, SECTION 18 BELOW CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THESE PROVISIONS WILL AFFECT HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH BILLGO. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OR HAVE A CERTAIN TYPE OF DISPUTE WITH BILLGO AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 18.1, ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND BILLGO MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION.

THERE ARE SOME TERMS USED BELOW THAT ARE CAPITALIZED BUT AREN’T IMMEDIATELY DEFINED. THOSE TERMS HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM IN [EXHIBIT A](#exhibit-a).

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT A PAYMENT, INCLUDING SCHEDULING A PAYMENT, CANCELLING A SCHEDULED PAYMENT, OR DISPUTING A PAYMENT, PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN [EXHIBIT B](#exhibit-b) BELOW.

IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF BANKS OR SINGLE-USE VIRTUAL CREDIT CARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, PLEASE READ SECTIONS 2-4 AND EXHIBIT B BELOW.

### 1\. Acceptance; Modifications

You accept this Agreement by signing up for the App after being presented with a link to this Agreement, or by clicking **“AGREE”** or another acceptance button, or by otherwise showing you assent to the terms of this Agreement. BillGO may modify this Agreement following notice to you. BillGO’s notice may be provided via in-App messaging or email to your email address on file with BillGO. BillGO will also post any modified terms on its Website. By agreeing to the modified Agreement or by using the Service after you receive notice that the Agreement has been modified, you agree to the terms of the modified Agreement. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY MODIFIED AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED OR LICENSED TO USE THE SERVICE.

### 2\. Description of the Service

#### 2.1. What the Service Does

You may use the Service to link your bank, credit card, and bill payment accounts, review and track your bills, and facilitate your bill payments to Billers in the amounts and on the days you request (the **“Purpose”**). The Service then facilitates your bill payments by providing your payment instructions (including applicable Bill Pay Data) to a Biller, who then processes your payment. A payment may be made through your method of choice, which may (where available) include BillGO’s use of a single-use virtual credit card, in which case BillGO will: (A) make a payment on your behalf pursuant to your instructions while using a single-use virtual credit card; and (B) provide your applicable Bill Pay Data to a Bank (as defined below) that will debit the amount of the bill payment from your financial institution (the **“Single Use Card Process”**).

#### 2.2. SINGLE USE CARD PROCESS

WHEN USING THE SINGLE USE CARD PROCESS, YOUR PERSONAL PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION (INCLUDING YOUR NAME) IS **NOT** EXPOSED, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD AND MISUSE OF YOUR PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION. MOREOVER, BILLGO’S USE OF A SINGLE USE VIRTUAL CREDIT CARD DOES NOT IMPACT YOUR CREDIT SCORE. HOWEVER, WHEN A SINGLE USE VIRTUAL CREDIT CARD IS USED TO MAKE YOUR PAYMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BILLGO MAY EARN INTERCHANGE FEES AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, ALTHOUGH BILLGO MAY INITIATE THE SINGLE USE CARD PROCESS BASED ON YOUR DIRECTION AND CHOICES MADE WITHIN YOUR USER PROFILE, THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO USE SUCH PROCESS IS AT BILLGO’S SOLE DISCRETION.

#### 2.3. What the Service Doesn’t Do

The Service is limited to the Purpose. BillGO and the Service do not: (A) take possession of your payment funds; (B) transmit or transfer funds or provide deposit account or other financial services; (C) set the terms of any payment transaction between you and Billers; (D) endorse or have any liability for transactions between you and Billers; or (E) control or have any liability for returns, refunds, chargebacks, or other questions or disputes you may have with any Biller related to any payment transaction.

#### 2.4. Bank Transmission

The Service is operated by BillGO in conjunction with SouthState Bank, N.A., a national bank, and MVB Bank, a West Virginia state-chartered bank, both Member FDIC (each, a **“Bank”** and together the **“Banks”**). The Banks only have the limited responsibility set forth in Section 2.1 above, are not parties to this Agreement, and have no other responsibilities under this Agreement. This Agreement does not modify any separate written agreement you may have with any Bank or Biller.

#### 2.5. Supplemental Bill Pay Terms

Additional terms and conditions relating to the bill payment process are set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms in the body of this Agreement and the terms in Exhibit B, the terms in Exhibit B will control but solely to the extent of the conflict.

#### 2.6. Accuracy

It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the payment details are accurate and complete before you initiate a bill payment. Failure to provide accurate and complete information may result in errors in your requested payments to Billers, and you may not be able to recover a payment sent to an incorrect account or recipient.

#### 2.6. Limitations

The Service does not support payments to all types of Billers. For example, you may not initiate payments to Billers outside of the U.S., or to certain government agencies for certain types of payments (e.g., tax payments or certain court-ordered payments). In addition, when you send a payment using the Service, a Biller is not obligated or required to accept it. You acknowledge that Billers may not accept payment from all types of funding sources and that BillGO may otherwise limit the payment methods available for a particular Biller. BillGO may refuse to permit payment to a Biller if it reasonably believes such refusal is necessary or advisable for legal or security reasons. If you fail to maintain a balance in the applicable Payment Account that is sufficient to fund any payment that you initiate, the transaction may not be completed, and BillGO will have no liability for such incomplete transaction. Finally, your Payment Accounts must be held with U.S. financial institutions.

### 3\. Authorization and Account Information

#### 3.1. Biller Account Information

By using the Service, you authorize BillGO to access your Biller Account, including via the Biller’s website, on your behalf and as your limited agent, in order to provide the Service. In the event a Biller employs the use of a “CAPTCHA” or similar technology on its website during the login process, you further authorize the Service (or any third-party technology therein) to decode such “CAPTCHA” or similar technology as your limited agent on your behalf. After linking or adding a Biller Account through the Service, the Service will submit information, including usernames and passwords that you provide, to log into the Biller’s website. You authorize BillGO as your limited agent to use and store information associated with your Biller Account in order to provide the Service, including by ensuring the Service is compatible with the applicable Biller website.

#### 3.2. Payment Account Information

By initiating a bill payment through the Service, you authorize BillGO and the Service to act as your limited agent to perform the actions described in Section 2.1 above and this Section 3.2, including accessing your applicable Bill Pay Data and transmitting that data to Banks and Billers. If BillGO uses a single-use virtual credit card to make a payment on your behalf, you specifically authorize: (A) BillGO to pay your bill using a single-use virtual credit card; and (B) a Bank to initiate a debit from your applicable Payment Account in the amount of your bill payment. You are solely responsible for complying with any terms set by your bank, credit union, or financial institution with respect to your Payment Account, including any terms relating to transaction limitations or fees, such as those pertaining to non-sufficient funds or overdrafts. If you are entitled to a reversal, refund, or other adjustment associated with a payment you made using the Service, you also authorize the crediting of your Payment Account to complete that transaction.

#### 3.3. Payment Account Information

**AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT BILLERS AND THEIR IP.** THE APP PROVIDES EASY WAYS FOR YOU TO IDENTIFY YOUR BILLERS. **HOWEVER, ALL REFERENCES TO THIRD PARTIES (I.E., ANY PARTY OTHER THAN YOU AND BILLGO) ARE FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY AND DO NOT IMPLY ANY ENDORSEMENT OR SPONSORSHIP OF, OR ANY AFFILIATION WITH, THE APP OR BILLGO.** ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOT OWNED BY BILLGO (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THIRD-PARTY TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, LOGOS, AND DOMAIN NAMES) IS THE PROPERTY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS. USE OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DOES NOT IMPLY ANY ENDORSEMENT, SPONSORSHIP OR AFFILIATION.

**(C) Term for Paid Service**  
  
These provisions only apply to you if you purchased a paid version of the Service.  
  
**(1)No Renewal** If your Subscription Documents do not provide for automatic renewals, then your subscription (and all associated rights) to the Service will expire at the end of the Subscription Term.  
  
**(2) Automatic Renewals** If your Subscription Documents state that your subscription is subject to automatic renewals, then upon expiration of the initial Subscription Term, your subscription to the Service will automatically renew for the specified renewal Subscription Term at BillGO’s then-current pricing, in accordance with the terms and conditions pertaining to automatic renewals presented to you in the Subscription Documents. You may elect not to renew your subscription pursuant to the terms of such Subscription Documents, or if such Subscription Documents are silent on the matter, then by providing BillGO notice of your intent not to renew at least 30 days prior to the next renewal Subscription Term.

Unless set forth otherwise in any Subscription Documents (e.g., if you have a paid Service as set forth above), this Agreement will continue until terminated by you or BillGO as described below.

#### 11.1. Termination by You

If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by deleting your account within the App and by deleting the App. Simply deleting the App will not delete your account with BillGO, but only delete the data from your mobile device.

If you have a free version of the Service, BillGO reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend, terminate or otherwise deny your access to, and use of, the Service and to block or prevent your future access to, and use of, the Service, in which case this Agreement will also terminate. Upon notice of termination, you must delete the App from all your mobile devices.

#### 11.3. Paid Service - Termination by BillGO

If you have a paid version of the Service, then BillGO may, by use of a disabling device or any other lawful means, suspend, terminate, or otherwise deny your access to or use of the Service, without incurring any resulting obligation or liability, if: (A) BillGO receives a judicial or other governmental demand, order, subpoena, or law enforcement request that expressly or by reasonable implication requires it to do so; (B) you refuse to accept the terms of any modified Agreement, despite receiving notice of such modified Agreement; (C) any aspect of this Agreement is limited by law or third-party terms of service; (D) BillGO believes, in its reasonable discretion, that: (1) you breached or failed to comply with any term of this Agreement; or (2) you are, have been, or are likely to be involved in any fraudulent or unlawful activities; or (E) this Agreement expires or is terminated.

### 16\. U.S. Government Users

The Service is for use by consumers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service and any associated documentation are “Commercial Items”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software Documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable.

### 18\. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

#### 18.1. Agreement to Arbitrate

You and BillGO agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or the Service (each, a **“Dispute”**) must be determined by binding arbitration, except that you retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court (a **“Small Claims Action”** ). In addition, because BillGO is allowing you to use certain proprietary technology as set forth in this Agreement, BillGO may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual, suspected, or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and patent rights, database rights, and other proprietary and intellectual property rights (each, an **“IP Protection Action”**).

#### 18.2. Opt-Out

Without limiting the above, you have the right to litigate any Dispute in a court of general jurisdiction if you provide BillGO with written notice via email to arbitrationoptout@billgo.com (such notice, an **“Arbitration Opt-out Notice”**). To be effective, an Arbitration Opt-Out Notice must: (A) contain your name, the date, your email address, and a statement expressing your desire to opt out of binding arbitration; and (B) be received by BillGO within 30 days following your download of the App and entry into this Agreement or within 30 days following any modification to this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS, YOU KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION IF YOU DON’T PROVIDE BILLGO WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOREGOING REQUIREMENTS. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any Small Claims Action or any Dispute where you timely provide BillGO with a valid Arbitration Opt-out Notice are the state and federal courts located in the City and County of Denver, Colorado, and you and BillGO each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. The following Sections 18.3-18.8 below apply to all Disputes that are not Small Claims Actions, IP Protection Actions, or Disputes where you provided BillGO with a valid Arbitration Opt-Out Notice.

#### 18.3. CLASS ACTION WAIVER

ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM MUST BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR BILLGO MAY SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, A COLLECTIVE ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH YOU OR BILLGO ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF YOU, BILLGO, AND ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING.

#### 18.4. Notice of Dispute

In the event of a Dispute, you must first send to BillGO, by email or certified mail, a written notice of Dispute (**“Notice of Dispute”**). The Notice of Dispute must be either emailed to Legal@BillGO.com or mailed to BillGO, Inc., Attn: General Counsel, P.O. Box 272390, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80527, and in each instance must be titled: NOTICE OF DISPUTE UNDER PRISM TERMS OF SERVICE. The Notice of Dispute must include both your email address and the mailing address you would like BillGO to use when contacting you. If BillGO elects to initiate arbitration against you, it will send its own Notice of Dispute to the email address and mailing address it has on file for you. A Notice of Dispute must: (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought (**“Demand”**).

#### 18.5. Proceedings

If you and BillGO do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or BillGO may commence an arbitration proceeding. Any arbitration must be governed and administered by the American Arbitration Association (the **“AAA”**) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the **“Consumer Procedures”**), except that this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. ALL ISSUES IN THE DISPUTE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REVIEW OF A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR. In ruling on a Dispute, the neutral arbitrator will apply the terms of this Agreement and the laws of the State of Colorado. The arbitrator has discretionary authority to conduct the arbitration via conference call or face-to-face hearing. The arbitrator will render an award within the time specified in the Consumer Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. BillGO and you agree that the arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 13 above (“Limitation of Liability”) as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. You may download or copy the AAA’s forms and rules from https://www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Unless you and BillGO otherwise agree in writing, the arbitration must be conducted in the City and County of Denver, Colorado. If your Demand does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and BillGO submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your Demand exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Consumer Procedures. Subject to the Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

#### 18.6. AAA Not Integral to Agreement to Arbitrate

You and BillGO agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and BillGO will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, either party may request a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the Consumer Procedures.

#### 18.7. Severability

If one or more parts of this Section 18 are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of Section 18. If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such court proceeding will be the state or federal courts sitting in the city and county of Denver, Colorado. For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, such courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.

#### 18.8. FAA

The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of all provisions of this Agreement relating to arbitration.

### SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR BILL PAYMENTS

#### 1\. Scheduling a Payment Transaction

You may use the Service to make a payment today or to schedule a payment for a later date (**“Scheduled Payment Date”**). If you choose “Today”, the payment will be scheduled to be processed on the same Business Day, except that you must schedule the payment before the Biller’s designated cut-off time on a day that the Biller accepts payments in order for the payment to be received on the same Business Day. A payment that is scheduled for “Today” but submitted after the processing cut-off time (or on a day that is not a day the Biller accepts payments) will be paid on the next day the Biller accepts payments. Actual processing times vary by Biller; Biller deadlines may be shown in the App. If you schedule a payment on a weekend or holiday, your payment may not be processed until the next Business Day. BillGO is not obligated to provide you with any notice of delay in processing your payment to the Biller or of the completion or rejection of your payment to the Biller. You are solely responsible for contacting the designated Biller if you want to confirm receipt of your payment by the designated Biller on the same Business Day. BILLGO MAKES NO GUARANTEE THAT A BILLER WILL RECEIVE THE PAYMENT, OR POST A PAYMENT TO YOUR ACCOUNT, ON THE SAME BUSINESS DAY AS THE “TODAY” DATE. If you choose a Scheduled Payment Date, the payment will be scheduled to be processed on that day at 9:00 AM local time. Your Scheduled Payment Date must be before the actual due date of the bill you are intending to pay to avoid any interest or late payment charges. BillGO is not liable for any fees that result from late payments.

#### 2\. Cancelling a Payment Transaction

To cancel a future scheduled payment, open the bill you’d like to cancel and tap where it says “cancel payment”; scheduled payments can be cancelled up until the day of payment. If you want to cancel a payment scheduled for “Today”, you must message us within the App to “stop payment” or “cancel payment”. We will attempt to cancel the payment, but we do not and cannot guarantee that the payment will be cancelled. We will inform you of whether the cancellation was successful.

#### 3\. Preauthorized Recurring Payment Transactions

You may schedule a preauthorized recurring bill payment transaction using the Service. By doing so, you authorize BillGO to electronically debit your designated payment method to pay a specific Biller each month for a particular bill payment. As applicable, you also authorize BillGO to electronically debit and credit your designated payment method to correct erroneous debits and credits. You may stop payment of a preauthorized, recurring payment by notifying us orally or in writing at least three Business Days before the scheduled date of the payment by emailing us at compliance@prismmoney.com or calling us at 844-774-7627 (844-PRISM-APP). BILLGO CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE BILL PAYMENT WILL BE STOPPED IF YOU FAIL TO CONTACT US AT LEAST THREE BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED PAYMENT DATE. Some preauthorized bill payments are for Billers where the amount due or minimum payment amount will vary from the previous bill payment to the same Biller under the same authorization or from the preauthorized amount. For these types of preauthorized recurring bill payments, if you have provided us with the information required to receive bill payment information from the designated payee (e.g., Biller log-in information), we will notify you electronically at least 10 days before the scheduled bill payment of the bill payment amount. You are responsible for any fees or other amounts charged by your Biller or your bank related to the scheduled payments if you do not contact us to make changes or stop a scheduled payment within the timeframes indicated herein.

#### 4\. Refunds or Reversals of Completed Payments

You cannot use the Service to request a refund, cancellation, correction, or reversal of a completed payment (a **“Payment Modification”**). In such situations, you will need to contact a Biller’s customer service department to request such Payment Modification. If the Biller cannot, or is unwilling, to assist you with a request for a Payment Modification, you should contact your financial institution’s customer service department to determine if your financial institution is able to provide additional assistance. If BillGO elected to use the Single Use Card Process as described in the Agreement, you will not be able to make such a request without first obtaining specific information and assistance from us, which we will provide when you contact us.

#### 5\. Biller Taxes

It is your (or your Biller’s) responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make to such Biller, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. BillGO is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your payment transaction or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any payment transaction.

#### 6\. Unauthorized Payment Transactions

##### 6.1. Notice

You must notify BillGO immediately: (A) if you believe that that your Payment Data has been accessed or used in an unauthorized manner within the Service (i.e., in a way not authorized by you, such as an unauthorized electronic funds transfer); or (B) if you believe your phone number or password used to log in to the Service (each, a **“Login Credential”**) have been lost or stolen. In such circumstances you should contact us via email at: compliance@prismmoney.com. You may also call us at 844-774-7627 (844-PRISM-APP) or write us at:

##### 6.2. Consumer Protections

Depending on the type of payment account used, you may also be directed or required to contact the payment account bank in order to avail yourself of consumer protections under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (for deposit payment accounts; see Section 9 below for more information) or the Truth in Lending Act (for credit accounts and lines). When BillGO receives notification from you, it will suspend your account. An “Unauthorized Electronic Funds Transfer” is an electronic funds transfer initiated by a person other than you who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority to initiate the transfer, and from which you do not benefit. If you give access to your account to another person, all payments by that person are authorized unless and until you notify us that payments by that person are no longer authorized.

##### 6.3. MVB Bank Notice

As stated above, you should contact BillGO regarding any unauthorized electronic funds transfers. Additionally, you may contact MVB Bank directly if you should have any questions, concerns, or detect an error with an electronic funds transfer(s) through MVB Bank. You can contact MVB Bank via email at programcompliance@mvbbanking.com. You may also call at 833-MVB-TECH or write to at:

If you have any questions, concerns, or detect an error with an electronic funds transfer through SouthState Bank, N.A., you can email BillGO at mailto:payment-inquiries@billgo.com or call BillGO at 970-829-0809 and BillGO will attempt to resolve your issue or will route your issue to SouthState Bank, N.A.  
  
In addition, SouthState Bank, N.A.’s mailing address is: PO Box 550889, Atlanta, GA 30355, Attn: ACH Operations.

#### 7\. Payment Transaction Limits or other Suspicious Activity

BillGO may impose limits on the frequency and dollar amount of your payments to Billers and adjust the limits from time to time at our sole discretion. For example, we may limit the maximum dollar amount allowed per transaction, the aggregate dollar amount of transactions allowed over a period of time, or the maximum number of payments allowed over a period of time. The App will identify applicable limits and relevant time periods. A period of time may be measured as a calendar day, a rolling 30-day period, or otherwise. BillGO also reserves the right to decline to process any payment that appears illegal or in breach of this Agreement and to notify relevant authorities.

#### 8\. Collection of Returned Item Fees

If your payment is returned unpaid, you authorize BillGO at its sole discretion to instruct a Bank to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account to collect a $15 fee. This is in addition to other charges that may apply with your Biller or financial institution.

#### 9\. Electronic Fund Transfer Rights & Error Resolution Policy

##### 9.1. Your Liability

(A) _Authorized Transfers:_ You are liable for all electronic fund transfers that you authorize, whether directly or indirectly.  
  
(B) _Unauthorized Transfers:_ Tell us at once if you believe your Login Credential has been lost or stolen or if your Prism account has been, or may have been, subject to Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers. Contact us immediately to keep your possible losses to a minimum. You could lose all the money in your bank account(s).  
  
(C) If you tell us within four (4) Business Days after learning of the loss or theft of your Login Credential for your Prism account or after learning of any other Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers associated with your Prism account, you can lose no more than $50. However, if you DO NOT tell us within four (4) Business Days after learning of the loss, theft or unauthorized use associated with your Prism account, and we can establish that we could have prevented the Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer(s) if you had told us in time, you could lose as much as $500.  
  
(D) If your periodic account statement issued by your bank or financial institution shows Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers and you DO NOT tell us within ninety (90) days after the statement was delivered to you, you may not get back any money you lose after the ninety (90) day period if we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized transfer(s) if you had told us in time. If an extenuating circumstance (such as extended travel or hospitalization) prevents you from promptly notifying us of a suspected lost or stolen Login Credential or of any other suspected Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers(s), the time periods specified in this Section 9.1 may be extended for a reasonable period.

##### 9.2. Types of Transfers; Limitations

You may use the Service to pay Billers using the following types of electronic fund transfers: (A) Payments to Billers using a debit card.  
  
(B) Payments to Billers using automated clearing house (“ACH”) systems.  
  
(C) Preauthorized payments to Billers which result in periodic debits to your debit card or deposit account.  
  
Any limitations regarding such Service, such as the type of electronic fund transfers that you may make, or the frequency or dollar amount of transfers, will be communicated to you in writing or displayed to you through the Service. See Section 3 of this Exhibit B above for more information about stopping payment of preauthorized electronic fund transfers.

##### 9.3. Fees

BillGO charges no fees for electronic fund transfers or for the right to make transfers.

##### 9.4. Documentation

We will provide a receipt to you through the Service for each electronic fund transfer made through the Service.

You are responsible for reviewing your receipts and payment history and maintaining copies for your records.

##### 9.5. Our Liability

See Sections 13 (“Limitation of Liability”) of the main Terms of Service above. If BillGO fails to make or stop an electronic funds transfer in accordance with the terms of this Section 9, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:  
  
(A) If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your bank account or debit card to make a payment.  
  
(B) If the bank account or debit card you specify as the payment source is closed or does not contain sufficient funds to complete the payment or the charge is rejected or returned by your bank or financial institution.  
  
(C) If the Service was not working properly and you knew about the problems when you started your payment.  
  
(D) If we cannot complete a payment due to fraud or attacks on our systems or the Service.  
  
(E) If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent a payment, despite reasonable precautions we have taken.  
  
There may be other exceptions stated in our Agreement with you.

##### 9.6. Confidentiality Related to Electronic Fund Transfers

We will disclose information to third parties about the electronic fund transfers you make through the Service:

(C) If you give us written permission; or,  
  
(D) As otherwise provided in our Privacy Policy.

##### 9.7. Error Resolution

In case of errors or questions about your electronic fund transfers, call us at 844-774-7627 (844-PRISM-APP); or write us at BillGO, Inc., P.O. Box 272390, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80527. If you think your bank account statement, receipt or payment history within the App is wrong, or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement, receipt, or within the App, contact us as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 90 days after the statement or receipt was delivered to you. In your notification to us, you must:  
  
(A) Tell us your name and phone number associated with your Prism account.  
  
(B) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.  
  
(C) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.  
  
(D) If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.

We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your account. For errors involving new Prism accounts, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new Prism accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your Prism account for the amount you think is in error.

We will tell you the results within three Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE MUST BE DIRECTED TO BILLGO, AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. We are responsible for the Service and for resolving any errors in transactions made in conjunction with such Service.

We will not send you a periodic statement listing transactions that you make through the Service. The transactions will appear only on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution.

#### 10\. Consent to Electronic Communications

The App is an electronic, Internet-based service. Therefore you understand, agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents notices and disclosures (collectively “Communications”) that the App provides in connection with your use of the Service. Communications include:  
  
(A) this agreement and any updates, amendments, modifications, or supplements to it;

BillGO will provide these Communications to you by posting them in the “News” and/or “Notifications” sections of the App. BillGO will also provide updated versions of agreements and policies on its website. You agree that electronic Communications have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. All Communications will be deemed to have been received by you no later than five Business Days after BillGO posts them in the app or otherwise communicates them to you via the Service (e.g., pop-up notification, email or text message). You agree that these are reasonable procedures for providing electronic Communications. You should maintain copies of electronic Communications by printing paper copies or saving electronic copies, as applicable.

If, after you consent to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper copy of a Communication we previously sent you, you may request a copy within 180 Days after the date we provided the Communication to you by contacting us as described above. We will send your paper copy to you by U.S. mail. In order for us to send you paper copies, you must provide us with a current street address.
