**Limitation of Liability**

Perfect Color Ventures, LLC DBA MyPerfectColor shall not be liable for any special or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use, the materials on this site or the performance of the products, even if Perfect Color Ventures, LLC DBA MyPerfectColor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Applicable law may not allow the limitation of exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

MyPerfectColor limits its responsibility to the value of the paint sold and will only replace or refund the paint in the event of a matching error or mistake by MyPerfectColor. The colors displayed on the MyPerfectColor website are on-screen representations and are not the actual colors. Please view a physical color swatch or material sample to confirm your color choice prior to purchase. Please always double check your paint colors before painting. See more information below in the sections for “Custom Colors, Website Display and Variation” and “Digital Colors“.

Since all paint colors are custom made to order, all sales are final. No returns or refunds will be offered. In the event of an error by MyPerfectColor, please contact customer service for a replacement or refund.

  
**Custom Colors, Accuracy, Website Display and Variation**

MyPerfectColor takes the satisfaction of its customers very seriously. MyPerfectColor creates and maintains a batch sample for every color ordered and verifies this in a light box calibrated to D65 Daylight against the physical sample at our facility before shipping.

MyPerfectColor strives to reproduce colors accurately and uses a combination of a spectrophotometer measurement and visual inspection to verify accuracy. If the DeCMC (a measure of color accuracy) is 3.0 or less, it is considered within the range of acceptability.

Since all paint colors are custom made to order, all sales are final. No returns or refunds will be offered. In the event of an error by MyPerfectColor, then please contact customer service for a replacement.

Color images displayed on the MyPerfectColor website are on-screen representations and are not the actual colors. Limitations in display technology, variations in display devices, and the inherent differences between illuminated digital colors and physical colors contribute to the variance between the on screen and actual paint colors. Please do not make a purchase decision based solely upon on-screen images. If you choose to do so it is at your own risk.

The actual paint color is based on the original color as represented by physical parts, samples, or swatches. The color title displayed on MyPerfectColor describes the specific color name, number and original manufacturer of the color. If the color you are seeking only matches part of the MyPerfectColor name, then it may not be the same color. Color names are arbitrary and not universal. Many different manufacturers may use the same color name but the colors will be different. Please view a physical color swatch or material sample of the specific color being ordered to confirm your color choice prior to purchase. Since all color chips are affected by age, light, heat, and mechanical coating processes, paint color chips may also vary in color or finish from the actual paint in the container. Depending on clarity and depth of color, some colors may require multiple coats.

MyPerfectColor is providing it’s best attempt at its version of the color you are ordering based on physical parts, samples, or swatches from the original manufacturer that MyPerfectColor has obtained.

  
**Digital Color Spaces**

Digital color spaces such as RGB, Hex, and CMYK are not reliable ways to specify paint colors. These color spaces are device dependent and will yield different colors based on the measurement device used. You also cannot extract these values from an image or any online representation and expect paint to match. Any other color space values derived from these digital color spaces will carry their inherent inaccuracy.

MyPerfectColor can recreate paint colors based on these digital color spaces, but they are calculated matches that cannot be verified against a physical source as the actual colors only live in the digital domain. MyPerfectColor would input the color values into our matching software and generate a formula which would be used to make paint. There is no way to know what the physical representation of this color should be and nothing physical to compare against. Moreover, a color on a digital display cannot be compared to a physical color. It isn’t possible as the mind cannot simultaneously compare an illuminated color to a physical color.

There is far too much variation to expect matching colors using digital color spaces to yield accurate results. If you are trying to reproduce a physical color, then the only way to do this accurately is by matching paint against the actual physical part, swatch or sample.

Any colors ordered using digital color values are at the buyer’s own risk and are sold As Is with no refunds, returns or exchanges. All sales are final. We warn customers of this before purchasing and the paint is custom made to order per the buyer’s instructions.

**Shipping Damage**

MyPerfectColor will offer a full refund or replacement in the event of the paint being completely damaged and unusable during shipment. Even though MyPerfectColor uses appropriate packaging, paint can be damaged during shipment. However, if only a small amount of paint leaks or if cans get dented during shipment, the paint itself is undamaged and fully usable without any reduction in quality. In these cases MyPerfectColor will not offer a refund or replacement.

  
**Typographical Errors**

In the event that a Perfect Color Ventures, LLC DBA MyPerfectColor product is mistakenly listed at an incorrect price, Perfect Color Ventures, LLC DBA MyPerfectColor reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. Perfect Color Ventures, LLC DBA MyPerfectColor reserves the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, Perfect Color Ventures, LLC DBA MyPerfectColor shall issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.

These terms and conditions, or any part of them, may be terminated by Perfect Color Ventures, LLC without notice at any time, for any reason.
