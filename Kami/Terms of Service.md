Terms of Service
================

Thanks for using Kami. These terms of service (“Terms”) outline your use and access to the services, client software and websites (“Services”) provided by Kami Limited. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information, while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms and to review Kami’s Privacy and Acceptable Use policies. If you’re using our Services for an organization or institution, you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.

Effective: May 25th, 2024

Definition
----------

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Refers to computer systems that exhibit behaviours and capabilities commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.

**AI LLM (Large Language Model)**: A sophisticated form of AI that is trained on massive amounts of text data to generate human-quality text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

Your License to use our Services
--------------------------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any agreement entered into by your organization relating to the Services, Kami grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to access and use the Services. You shall not

(a) copy the Services or any part, feature, function or user interface thereof

(b) use the Services to store or transmit infringing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, or to store or transmit material in violation of third-party privacy rights

(c) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related systems or networks; and

(d) reverse engineer the Services (to the extent such restriction is permitted by law).

Privacy
-------

Kami’s current Privacy Policy (located at www.kamiapp.com/privacy-policy) is incorporated herein by reference and made part of this Agreement. You understand that through your use of our Services, you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in this Agreement, the Privacy Policy and any agreement entered into by your institution relating to the Services) of your information for hosting, processing and use by Kami.

### GDPR

These Service Terms incorporate the Kami GDPR Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”), when the GDPR applies to your use of the Kami Services to process User Data (as defined in the DPA). The DPA is effective as of 25 May 2018, relies on EU Standard Contractual Clauses (also called the SCCs or the EU Model Clauses) published by the European Commission and replaces and supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and Kami relating to the Directive 95/46/EC.

Your Files & Your Permissions
-----------------------------

When you use our Services, you provide us with your files (“Your Files”). Your Files are yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Files except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.

We need your permission to do things, like hosting Your Files, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like thumbnails, document previews, sorting, editing, sharing and searching. These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Files. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with. Refer to our Privacy Policy for a list of these 3rd party cloud providers and details of how your data is protected.

Sharing Your Files
------------------

Our Services let you share Your Files with others, so please think carefully about what you share.

AI LLM-Generated Content
------------------------

Ownership and Responsibility: AI-generated content will not be integrated into Kami or used by Kami for marketing or training. You retain full ownership of any content you create with AI LLM assistance. You are accountable for the responsible use and potential modification of generated content.

Your Responsibilities
---------------------

You’re responsible for your conduct, Your Files and you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so.

We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy. With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren’t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.

Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don’t have access to it, and keep your account information current.

Finally, by using our Services, you are representing to us that you’re over 13 years of age, OR have been granted approved access to our Services by your school or parents.

--------------------

* User Responsibility: You (the teacher, administrator, or other authorised user) are solely responsible for submitting data to our AI services. It is your obligation to ensure all submitted data complies with applicable local laws, school regulations and policies.
* Administrative Control: Administrators have the ability to enable or disable AI services for their entire school. If no selection is made, individual teachers may opt in to these services, acknowledging their agreement to these terms.
* AI Disabled: When AI features are disabled through the administrative panel, no data will be submitted to any LLMs, including Google and teachers will not be able to enable AI features. Certain platform features may have reduced functionality as a result.

Software
--------

Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“Software”) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.

------------

As part of the Services we make available resources, such as templates, activities and other content, for use by teachers (“Templates”). If you are a teacher you may access and download Templates from our website and use our Templates for educational purposes (including sharing them on social media). However you must not distribute or resell our Templates or otherwise use them for commercial purposes. The disclaimers and limitations set out elsewhere in these Terms apply to our Templates.

You have the choice to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice, if you are not complying with Kami’s Terms of Services, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others’ use of the Services. Except for paid accounts, we reserve the right to terminate and delete your account if you haven’t accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months. We’ll provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Kami, its affiliates, suppliers or distributors be liable for;

(a) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages or any loss of use, data, business, or profits, regardless of legal theory, whether or not Kami has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose, and

(b) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the services more than the greater of $20 or the amounts paid by you to Kami for the past 12 months of the services in question. Some states don’t allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice
---------------------------------------

We may terminate the use privileges of users who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights. Accordingly, you may not store any material or content on, or disseminate any material or content over, the Products in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law. Owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) to report alleged infringements.

1. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;  
    A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;

3. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
4. An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed; and
5. A statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

Resolving Disputes
------------------

Let’s Try To Sort Things Out First – We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Kami, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@kamiapp.com. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Kami may bring a formal proceeding.

**We Both Agree To Arbitrate** – You and Kami agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.

**Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate** –You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.

**Arbitration Procedures** – The arbitration will be held in New Zealand, or any other location we agree to.

**Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate** – Either you or Kami may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New Zealand. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

**Judicial forum for disputes** – In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Kami agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the courts of New Zealand. Both you and Kami consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

Force Majeure
-------------

Kami shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation hereunder due to causes beyond its control, including without limitation, war, riot, insurrection, civil commotion, terrorist activity, fire, industrial disputes of whatever nature, acts of nature, computer crimes, epidemics, acts or omissions of third party vendors or suppliers, equipment failures, public enemies of government, failure of telecommunications, system malfunctions, fire, or other casualty.

Waiver, Assignment and Severability
-----------------------------------

Waiver by Kami of any default or breach by you of any provision contained in this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default or breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. If any part of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal, in conflict with any law, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Kami may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

No Third Party Beneficiaries
----------------------------

The parties do not intend to confer any right or remedy on any third party.

Controlling Law
---------------

These Terms will be governed by New Zealand law except for its conflicts of laws principles.

Entire Agreement
----------------

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Kami with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter  of these Terms.

Modifications
-------------

We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
