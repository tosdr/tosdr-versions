The Party affected by a Force Majeure event shall keep the other Party informed on a regular basis via electronic mail regarding the prognosis of eliminating such Force Majeure event or of recovering from it.

Should the effects of this Force Majeure last more than thirty (30) days, as of the date of notice regarding such event from one Party to the other, the Agreement may be terminated as a matter of right, at the request of one of the Parties, without any right to compensation for either of them.

Or Abstultus shall not be liable the Customer causes, for example:

* a deterioration of the application;

* a request for a temporary or permanent interruption of the Service from a competent administrative or judicial authority, or upon notice from a third party; or
* the total or partial destruction of information transmitted or stored resulting from errors directly or indirectly attributable to the Customer.

The Customer acknowledges that Abstultus authorizes other Service users to install their websites and servers in his/its facilities. Abstultus shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for damages, costs or losses incurred by the Customer (or by his/its own customers) and caused by another Service user’s act, material or failure to act, Abstultus’ liability in contract, in tort (including negligence) or by statute, or otherwise, to the Customer (or his/its own customers), concerning performance or non-performance, as applicable, of any obligation created under this Agreement, with regard to any claim, shall be limited and shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the total fees paid by the Customer to Abstultus under this Agreement in the three- (3-) month period immediately preceding the date on which the claim arose. In no event shall Abstultus be liable for any lost profits, or any special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive damages.

Abstultus does not offer any backup for the hosted data. It is therefore the Customer’s responsibility to take all required steps in order to back up his/its data in the event of a loss or deterioration of such data for any reason whatsoever, including reasons not explicitly mentioned hereunder.

SECTION 4: CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES

The Customer agrees to use his/its power, authority and capabilities to enter into this Agreement and perform his/its obligations as provided hereunder.

The Customer agrees to communicate to Abstultus his/its accurate and updated contact information upon the creation of the Customer Account and each time such information is modified.

Abstultus reserves the right to request supporting documentation from the Customer to ensure the accuracy of their information.

The Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for the passwords that are required in order to use the Service. Abstultus is not responsible for the illegal or fraudulent use of passwords made available to the Customer. The passwords provided are considered confidential. The Customer shall be solely liable, at the exclusion of Abstultus, in the event of any suspicion that the passwords provided have been disclosed, whether intentionally or not.

The Customer alone shall bear all the consequences of a malfunction of the Service resulting from the use by his/its staff or by any other person to whom the Customer has provided his/its password(s). The Customer shall also bear all the consequences resulting from the loss of such password(s).

The Customer hereby agrees to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements in force, and, more specifically, with those pertaining to software, files, freedom and intellectual property, as well as the rights of third parties. The Customer also agrees to take out all required insurance policies from a well known solvent insurer, in order to cover all damages attributable to the Customer in connection with this Agreement or the performance thereof.

The Customer hereby fully accepts all legal obligations arising from the administration of their Services. Abstultus cannot be held liable or investigated in this respect for any reason, especially in the event of a violation of the laws or regulations applicable to the Customer's Services. Non-compliance by the Customer with the aforementioned points detailed in Abstultus’ Special Conditions, and especially with any activity likely to generate a civil and/or penal liability will give Abstultus the right to immediately disconnect and/or stop the Customer's Services without prior notice, and to immediately and lawfully terminate this Agreement, without prejudice to the right to all damages and interest that Abstultus may claim.

The Customer undertakes to settle directly with a claimant, any sum demanded from Abstultus by such claimant. Moreover, the Customer undertakes to intervene at the request of Abstultus in any proceedings brought against Abstultus and shall indemnify and hold harmless Abstultus from any and all such third party claims. Consequently, the Customer undertakes to address any third party complaint and/or procedure, regardless of form, object or nature, that is brought against Abstultus and is related to the Customer's obligations under this Agreement.

The Customer hereby agrees to inform Abstultus within 48 hours of any changes in his/its situation, and within 24 hours, of any lost passwords.

Whenever contacting Abstultus, the Customer agrees to clearly describe his/its request in compliance with the terms of use.

When suspicious activity (SPAM, violation of copyright, Attack, Phishing, illegal content, DoS PortScan ...) is detected by Abstultus or reported by a third party, Abstultus may contact the Client by email (and optionally attach a copy of the complaint received). It is expected that the Client respond to the notification within the time limit (24, 48 or 72 hours depending on the nature of the case) to provide its comments and intentions. Failure to respond could result in the suspension / termination of service.

SECTION 5: TECHNICAL SUPPORT

5-1 Tools and Documentation provided by Abstultus

Abstultus makes available to the Customer a set of tools and documentations which are accessible on the Abstultus Site.

These pages also include contact information to reach the Abstultus staff.

On these pages, Abstultus makes available to its Customer:

* a set of documentation and technical guides, designed to provide a better understanding and an easier use of the Service (“Documentation”);
* communication tools to find out about the condition of Abstultus’ facilities;
* contact information to reach Abstultus’ Technical Support;
* and an Incident Reporting Form and/or a Ticketing System

Preliminary checks:

In the event of Service malfunction, it is the Customer’s responsibility to consult the Documentation and perform the technical tests suggested by Abstultus on the Abstultus Site in the contact tools. If the malfunction problem encountered persists, the Customer shall have the responsibility of reporting the Incident to Abstultus.

5-2 Incident Reporting Procedure:

In order to report an Incident, the Customer shall complete the form designed for such purpose on the website and/or go to the Ticketing System where earlier tickets of electronic exchanges between the Customer and Abstultus may be found.

The Customer shall complete the form or ticket on the Abstultus Site and attempt to provide as much information as possible on the problem encountered to help with the Diagnostic.

To this end, the Customer explicitly authorizes Abstultus and its staff to connect to the Customer’s Service and to perform any operation required in connection with the Diagnostic, with respect to both the hardware and the software. Abstultus reserves the right to reject any intervention in this regard if Abstultus notices in its research work that the Customer uses the Service in breach of Abstultus’ General and Specific Terms and Conditions or of laws and regulations in force.

All the exchanges between the parties, and more particularly the electronic exchanges and telephone conversations, shall reflect Customer’s assent to Abstultus’ intervention.

5-3 Incident Takeover and Development of Diagnostic

Abstultus shall, in connection with the Incident reporting procedure, carry out a Diagnostic in order to determine the origin and cause of the malfunction problem. If, during the Diagnostic process, Abstultus concludes that the malfunction is an Incident, namely that it is a problem under the responsibility of Abstultus, the costs related to the Diagnostic process shall be entirely borne by Abstultus, in compliance with the Agreement terms and conditions applicable to the Service.

Alternatively, if the Diagnostic reveals that Abstultus does not bear responsibility for the Incident encountered by the Customer or that its existence cannot be confirmed the time spent by Abstultus on carrying out the Diagnostic will be invoiced to the Customer at a flat rate available for consultation noted on Abstultus’ Website. These fees may be waived at the sole discretion of Abstultus on an individual Incident basis. Any waiver of fees for any particular Incident does not constitute a waiver of any other rights of Abstultus under this agreement nor a waiver of future fees for future incidents.

In the event of Abstultus being unable to identify the origin or the cause of the incident, the investigations relating to production of the Diagnostic will not be invoiced to the Customer if Abstultus is unable to identify the cause of the dysfunction, or if Abstultus is unable to provide the customer with a quotation for the correction of the malfunction.

Likewise, the Diagnostic will not be invoiced to the Customer if Abstultus is unable to provide a quotation for the correction of the incident.

The Customer undertakes not to improperly make use of the Technical Assistance. Abstultus reserves the right to refuse to handle a Customer request if their conduct or the frequency of their requests is likely to adversely affect the normal operation of the Technical Assistance Service.

The Customer agrees to avoid using the Technical Support service in an abusive manner. Abstultus reserves the right to refuse to respond to a Customer’s claim if the Customer’s behavior or the frequency of claims is likely to disrupt the normal operations of the Technical Support service.

5-4 Resolution of Malfunction

At the end of the Diagnostic, Abstultus shall inform the Customer on the cause of the malfunction and indicate which technical solutions will be used to resolve the problem encountered.

At the end of the Diagnostic, Abstultus will convey the cause of the malfunction and will direct the Customer to the technical solutions for resolving the problem encountered.  
In the event of Abstultus not bearing the responsibility for the Malfunction, Abstultus will forward a quotation to the Customer corresponding to the cost of the resolution operations, if the Customer wants Abstultus to take charge of resolving its problem.

As previously stated, ABSTULTUS only has an obligation of means.

5.5 Conditions of payment

The base price of the quotation is set out on the Abstultus Site. The sums due will be invoiced monthly on the anniversary date of technical support being received for the Service. In the event of monthly renewal of the Service, all sums due relating to this Service, including technical support, will be invoiced.

No new interventions will be carried out if the payment of the preceding intervention has not been honored.

SECTION 6:

6.1. Term

The Service agreement shall be signed for an indefinite term. Abstultus reserves the right to suspend the Service at any time. Abstultus shall, to the extent possible, notify in advance the Service users, through a message on the mailing list created in connection with the beta-test, on Abstultus’ website or forum, or by any other means Abstultus deems necessary.

6.2. Service Renewal

Abstultus may possibly not renew its Service at the end of the term. Abstultus shall make every effort to inform the Customer beforehand regarding this and shall delete all the data stored by the Customer on the Service. The Customer hereby agrees to recover all his/its data prior to the end of the Service term.

Any non-payment or irregular payment, meaning incorrect or incomplete amounts in particular, or lacking the required references, or made by any method or procedure not accepted by Abstultus are not acceptable and will result in rejection by Abstultus of the registration or renewal request.

Concerning renewals paid by check, it is up to the Customer to request the renewal with sufficient time for the check to be received and processed by Abstultus prior to expiration of the Service. Abstultus reminds the Customer that the processing of a payment by check may take more than 5 working days in some cases.

SECTION 7: TERMINATION, LIMITATION AND SUSPENSION OF SERVICE

Breach by the Customer of his/its obligations as defined hereunder, including all activities specifically barred while using Abstultus services and/or any content specifically barred when using Abstultus services, and/or likely to result in civil and/or criminal liability and/or likely to prejudice a third party’s rights, shall give rise to Abstultus’ right to immediately cut off and/or interrupt the Customer’s services, without any prior demand, and to immediately terminate the Service, as of right, without prejudice to any other damages Abstultus may have a right to claim.

At the end of the term of this Service, for any reason whatsoever, Abstultus shall entirely delete all the files on the Customer‘s Service.

Abstultus reserves the right to restrict, limit or suspend its services without prior notice nor indemnity if it appears that the Customer uses the services provided for any activity which violates the terms and conditions of the Agreement with Abstultus or the Service objectives.

The Service may also be restricted, limited or suspended when the specific terms and conditions applicable to a type of Service offered by Abstultus provide for such sanctions in the event of a breach.

The restriction, limitation or suspension measures shall always be taken in accordance with the seriousness or recurrence of the breach(es), and shall be based on the nature of such breach(es).

The Customer agrees in advance that Abstultus may restrict, limit or suspend the Service offered if Abstultus receives a notice in that regard from a competent administrative, arbitral or judicial authority, in compliance with the laws and regulations in force.

Either Party may terminate the Agreement, as of right and without indemnity, in the case of a Force Majeure event lasting more than thirty (30) days.  
Abstultus reserves the right to interrupt the Customer’s Service if such Service endangers the maintenance of security or stability on Abstultus’ hosting platform. Abstultus shall, to the extent possible, give the Customer prior notice regarding such interruption.

Abstultus reserves the right to interrupt the Service, as needed, for technical interventions designed to improve its operations, or for maintenance procedures.

SECTION 10: TOLERANCE

The fact that Abstultus fails to invoke one of the General Terms and Conditions of Service and/or tolerates the violation by the other Party of any of the obligations hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver to invoke in the future any of these Terms and Conditions.

SECTION 11: PERSONAL DATA

Abstultus reminds the Customer that, while providing the Service to the Customer, Abstultus may keep some of the Customer’s personal data in compliance with its regulatory and judicial obligations.

The Customer also acknowledges that Abstultus may communicate the Customer’s information at the request of administrative, regulatory or judicial authorities.

SECTION 12: AMENDMENTS

The parties agree that Abstultus may, as of right, bring changes to its Service simply by informing the Customer through an online notice and/or by amending its General Terms and Conditions online. Any amendment or introduction of new options offered shall be posted online on the Abstultus Site or sent via e-mail to the Customer. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7, the Customer shall then have the right to terminate the Agreement within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such amendments.

SECTION 13: GENERAL PROVISIONS

13.1 Severability

The invalidity of one of the provision of the Service Agreement entered into with Abstultus, particularly under a law or a regulation or as a result of the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, shall not invalidate the other provisions of such Service Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect.
