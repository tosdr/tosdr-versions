Terms of Service



These Terms of Service (this “Agreement”) set out the terms on which JASSBY, INC. (“Jassby”, “we” or

“us”) will provide access to and use of certain services available on or through its websites and/or mobile

applications (collectively, the “Service”) to you, a user of the Service (“you” or “User”). You should read this

Agreement carefully. By indicating acceptance of this Agreement or by otherwise using the Service, you are

entering into a legally binding agreement with us (and you thereby represent that you are of legal age, and are

otherwise fully able and competent, to enter into a binding agreement). If you are a parent or guardian reviewing

and accepting these terms on behalf of a child, “Users” and “you” refers both to you and your child. If you do not

agree to these terms and conditions, you must not use the Service.



THIS AGREEMENT CREATES A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND JASSBY, INC.,

AND INCLUDES AN ARBITRATION AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE UNDER WHICH CERTAIN

CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE ASSERTED IN ARBITRATION IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, AND MAY

NOT BE BROUGHT IN COURT OR DECIDED BY A JURY. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT

CAREFULLY.



1. Nature of the Service.



1.1 General. The Service allows parents and legal guardians who are of legal age (“Parents”) to

open deposit accounts (each, an “Allowance Account”) and/or debit card accounts (each, a

“Debit Card Account”), managed by Jassby. Parents may allocate funds in their Allowance

Accounts and/or Debit Card Accounts for use by their children (“Children” or a “Child”), and

Parents may control and monitor Children’s purchases. The Service also allows Users to access

certain information or other content (which may include data, text, photos, video or other

materials or content) related to finances, shopping, and other topics and to shop within an in-

application online marketplace (the “Jassby Shop”).

1.1.1 Allowance Accounts. Allowance Accounts are held by Needham Bank and are

subject to Needham Bank’s Allowance Account Agreement, Disclosures, and

Privacy Policy, all published at: https://legal.jassby.com/needham-privacy ;

and E-Sign Agreement, published at: https://legal.jassby.com/e-sign, which are all

incorporated by reference. Jassby does not hold funds; any funds that you may add

to your Allowance Account are solely held by Needham Bank. Funds in Allowance

Accounts may only be used in the Jassby Shop.

1.1.2 Debit Card Accounts. Debit Card Accounts are held by Sutton Bank and are

subject to the Jassby Debit Card Cardholder Agreement, published at:

https://legal.jassby.com/index.html#physical-debit-card; E-Sign Agreement,

published at: https://legal.jassby.com/e-sign; Fee Disclosures, published at:

https://legal.jassby.com/fee-disclosures; and Sutton Bank Privacy Policy,

published at: https://legal.jassby.com/sutton-privacy, all of which are incorporated

by reference. Jassby does not hold funds; any funds that you may add to your Debit

Card Account are solely held by Sutton Bank. The Jassby Debit Card is issued by

Sutton Bank, Member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Mastercard International

Inc.



Debit Card Accounts that see no activity for six consecutive calendar months may

be closed.



Users who elect to open Debit Card Accounts may be given the choice of selecting

a no-fee Jassby account plan for their family (the “No Fee Plan”) or selecting a

- 2 -



B4898977.1



plan that includes additional features, for a monthly fee. These offerings are

described below in Section 4, Subscription Levels.



1.2 No Financial Advice. Though the Service is intended to allow Parents and Children to learn

about finances in a fun, safe way, Jassby is not engaged in rendering financial advice through

the Service. The information provided via the Service, including but not limited to, any

information related to the Jassby Financial Literacy Score, should not be interpreted as a

substitute for consultation with a financial professional regarding any financial matter. You

represent to us (which representation shall be deemed to be made each time you use the Service)

that you are not using the Service for the purpose of seeking financial advice.



1.3 User Accounts.

1.3.1 Family Organizer Account. In order for you and your family to use the Service, a

Parent must first create a user account with the Service, designating themselves as

the head of your family for purposes of your family’s use of the Service (the

“Family Organizer”), by registering, as set forth below (the “Family Organizer

Account”). Each family group that is registered with the Service (a “Family”) may

have only one Family Organizer. The Family Organizer Account may require the

designation of a bank account or debit card which will be debited or charged when

you fund an Allowance Account or Debit Card Account (a “Funding Source”).

You may be required to fund your Allowance Account or Debit Card Account

before you can utilize the features provided by the Service.

1.3.2 Additional Parent Account. For an additional parent (an “Additional Parent”) to

use the Service as part of your Family, the Family Organizer must create a user

account with the Service for the Additional Parent within the Family (an

“Additional Parent Account”). By creating an Additional Parent Account, you, the

Family Organizer, represent that the Additional Parent is over the age of eighteen

(18) and agree to accept full responsibility for the Additional Parent’s use of the

Service. Once the Family Organizer has created an Additional Parent Account, the

Additional Parent may link a Funding Source to the Service in order to use the

Service.

1.3.3 Child Account. For a Child to use the Service as part of your Family, the Family

Organizer must create a user account with the Service for the Child within the

Family (a “Child Account”). Where possible, a Child who has his or her own bank

account (a “Child Bank Account”) may link this to the Service, subject to Family

Organizer consent. Such linkage is for viewing purposes, only, and the funds in

the Child Bank Account will not be used for making purchases through the Service.



1.4 Use of the Service. The Service allows a Parent to open an Allowance Account or Debit Card

Account, which may be funded from their linked Funding Source, and allocate funds for use

by the user of a Child Account within the same Family. The Family Organizer may impose

limitations on the funds allocated to a linked Child Account. A user of a Child Account who

has access to an Allowance Account will be able to purchase items (each, a “Purchased Item”)

made available in the Jassby Shop. Payments for Purchased Items will be debited from the

Allowance Account, as applicable, up to the amount allocated for use by the Child. A user of a

Child Account who has access to a Debit Card Account may use their debit card (the “Jassby

Debit Card”) to shop anywhere that Mastercardâ is accepted, subject to Section 1.1.2 of this

Agreement. The Service also allows users of Parent Accounts to make purchases through the

Jassby Shop, and, if they have opened Debit Card Accounts, to shop anywhere that

Mastercardâ is accepted, subject to Section 1.1.2 of this Agreement. Payments for Purchased

Items purchased directly by a Parent will be debited from their Allowance Account or charged

to their Jassby Debit Card, as applicable.

- 3 -



B4898977.1



The Service may also provide within its application to users of Child Accounts designated

“Spending” and “Saving” pockets for their allocated funds. These pockets are provided solely

your convenience and the convenience of the user of the Child Account in order to enable the

designation of allocated funds. The Service does not provide interest-bearing savings accounts.



The Service also allows Users who are members of a single family group connected by a single

Family Organizer to reallocate funds to which they have been given access to the users of other

User Accounts within the same family group, subject to any limitations set forth in this

Agreement and the terms of Section 1.1.1 or Section 1.1.2. of this Agreement, as applicable.



1.5 Authorization to Debit Funding Source. By transferring funds to an Allowance Account or a

Debit Card Account, you represent and warrant to Jassby that you are authorized to use the

Funding Source(s) linked to your account with the Service and you authorize Jassby to debit

or charge your linked Funding Source for the amounts transferred. These authorizations will

remain in full force and effect until you notify Jassby by e-mail at support@jassby.com that

you wish to revoke them. You agree to hold Jassby harmless for any expenses, including fees,

incurred as a result of there being insufficient funds associated with your linked Funding

Source. Charges to a Funding Source will generally occur within 5 days after you initiate a

funds transfer.



When you link a new Funding Source to the Service, you may be prompted to make an initial

transfer from that Funding Source into your Allowance Account or Debit Card account, which

will be split at random into two separate transactions. You may be asked to verify the dollar

amounts of the two transactions before you can use the Funding Source for further funding of

your Allowance Account or Debit Card Account.



1.6 Automatic Replenishment Funding. You may pre-authorize transfers from your linked Funding

Source into an Allowance Account or Debit Card Account, in the form of automatic

replenishment funding (“Autofund”). Once you enable Autofund, these authorizations will

remain in full force and effect until you notify Jassby by e-mail at support@jassby.com that

you wish to revoke them.



If you choose to enable Autofund, each time your Allowance Account or Debit Card Account

balance falls below the pre-set balance of your choosing, we will automatically transfer funds

from your Funding Source (assuming there are available funds in the Funding Source) in the

amount you establish into your Allowance Account or Debit Card Account. You agree to hold

Jassby harmless for any expenses, including fees, incurred as a result of there being insufficient

funds associated with your linked Funding Source.



Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, funds transferred via Autofund may not be

immediately available and are subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in this

Agreement, including but not limited to, all applicable fees and transaction limits on your

Allowance Account or Debit Card Account. You may also consult your monthly statement or

contact customer support to see if the funds have been transferred to your Allowance Account

or Debit Card Account.



1.7 Payments for Purchases. By making a purchase from the Jassby Shop or otherwise making a

purchase with your Jassby Debit Card, you represent and warrant to Jassby that you are

authorized to use the Allowance Account or Jassby Debit Card Account and authorize Jassby

to debit your Allowance Account or Debit Card Account for the amount of the purchase. If

your purchase is subject to a use or sales tax, you may also be charged for those taxes. Users

are solely responsible for all purchases made from the Jassby Shop. Purchases made from the

- 4 -



B4898977.1



Jassby Shop are subject to the Jassby shop Return Policy, published at

https://legal.jassby.com/return-policy, and Jassby’s Shipping Fee Policy, published at

https://legal.jassby.com/shipping-policy, which are incorporated into this Agreement. You

agree to hold Jassby harmless for any expenses, including fees, incurred as a result of there

being insufficient funds in your Allowance Account or Debit Card Account and authorize

Jassby to debit or charge your Funding Source for any shortfall. Debits from or charges to an

Allowance Account or Debit Card Account will generally occur within 5 days after you make

a purchase either from the Jassby Store or with a Jassby Debit Card.



1.8 Statements, Disputed Debits \& Charges. Jassby shall transmit to you periodic statements

reflecting all debits, charges and transactions posted to your account no more than 45 days from

the date of posting the earliest of such charges. If you believe that Jassby posted an

unauthorized debit or charge to your account, to minimize your liability, you must notify Jassby

in person, by telephone, or in writing (addressed to Customer Support, Jassby, Inc., 530 Great

Road, Suite 200, Acton MA 01720), or by e-mail (addressed to customersupport@jassby.com)

within 60 days of Jassby's transmittal to you of a periodic account statement reflecting such

disputed charge. If you fail to do so, you may be liable for the amount of any unauthorized

charges to your account that occur after such 60-day period and before your notification to

Jassby that Jassby could have avoided had you provided timely notification.



1.9 Discount Codes. From time to time and at its sole discretion, the Company may offer discount

codes to Users, in the form of dollar credits, in varying amounts, to be applied to purchases

made through the Jassby Store. At its sole discretion, the Company may apply conditions to

the receipt and use of such discount codes, for example, to incentivize certain interactions

between the Users and the Service. By using the Service, you authorize us to apply any such

discount codes to purchases made by you and your child.



1.10 Jassby Bonuses. From time to time and at its sole discretion, the Company may offer monetary

bonuses to Users, in the form of funds deposited into in Allowance Account or Debit Card

Account (“Jassby Bonuses”). At its sole discretion, the Company may apply conditions to the

receipt of such Jassby Bonuses, for example, to incentivize certain interactions between Users

and the Service. By using the Service, you consent to the receipt of funds into your Allowance

Account or Debit Card Account and any associated Child Account resulting from Jassby

Bonuses. Jassby Bonuses may be subject to further terms and conditions.



1.11 Rewards. From time to time and at its sole discretion, the Company may allow Users to

participate in the Jassby Rewards Program (the “Rewards Program”). The Rewards Program

may allow eligible users to earn points through various activities within the Service and then

redeem those points for funds deposited into the Spending pocket of the Allowance Account

or Debit Card Account associated with the points-generating activity. The Rewards Program is

provided subject to this Agreement and the Rewards Program Terms and Conditions set forth

in Schedule A to this Agreement, which are incorporated herein. For the avoidance of doubt,

by redeeming points earned through the Rewards Program, you consent to the receipt of funds

into your Allowance Account or Debit Card Account and any associated Child Account

resulting from Rewards Program activity.



1.12 The Jassby Cash Back Program. From time to time and at its sole discretion, the Company

may allow Users to participate in the Jassby Cash Back Program (the “Cash Back Program”),

which may enable eligible users to elect certain cash back offers. This program is provided by

Payce, LLC and the cash back offers are provided pursuant to the Payce, LLC Terms of Use,

set forth at https://paycepays.com/jassby/Home/Terms, and the Payce, LLC Privacy Policy,

set forth at https://paycepays.com/jassby/Home/PrivacyPolicy, and may be subject to

- 5 -



B4898977.1



additional terms and conditions. Funds associated with cash back offer activity will be

deposited into the Spending Pocket of the Debit Card Account that utilized the offer.



1.13 Children. The Service is not directed to users under the age of 13 without the consent of a

Parent. The Service does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the

age of 13 without consent of a Parent. If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to

register as a User or to send personal information to Jassby without consent of a Parent, other

than to the extent needed to obtain a Parent’s consent.



2. Registration. In order to use certain parts of the Service, you may be required to provide us with your

name, residential address, social security number, birth date, phone number and email address or other screen name

or user name that functions as online contact information, create a password and register with us. Family Organizers

who create user accounts for other Family members may also be required to provide us with the names, email

addresses, and birth dates of those Family members. To the extent you are using the Service on behalf of an

organization, you may need to also provide us with information in order to confirm, or permit us to confirm, any

relationship between you and such organization. We may also request additional information from you. You

represent and warrant to us that you will provide us with accurate, current and complete registration information.

You are responsible for your registration, and for all use of the Service using any User credentials or passwords

issued to you or chosen by you. You will keep all such credentials and passwords confidential.



3. Fees and Orders. The Service, or certain features of the Service, may be available only if certain

subscription fees or other fees (collectively, “Fees”) are paid by you, or for your benefit (e.g., we may permit a

third party to pay certain Fees for your benefit). If you purchase any subscription plan for the Service or use certain

features of the Service, you must pay any applicable Fees. You will also be responsible for any taxes that may apply.

Fees will be deducted from the balance of the Allowance Account or Debit Card Account, as applicable. If there

are insufficient funds in the Allowance Account or Debit Card Account, fees may be withdrawn from your Funding

Source. For the avoidance of doubt, you authorize us to debit your Allowance Account, Debit Card Account, or

Funding Source for Fees. If any charge is rejected by our bank or payment providers, you are still liable to pay the

Fees. We retain the right to charge interest on any overdue balance at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the maximum

amount permitted by law (if lower). You will also be responsible for our reasonable costs of collection, including

attorney’s fees, if we deem it necessary to take any legal or administrative action to collect unpaid Fees. We reserve

the right to accept, refuse or cancel any orders placed through the Service, without liability or justification. We will

refund you in case your order was cancelled by us after your payment method has been charged.



4. Subscription Levels. From time to time and at its sole discretion, the Company may allow Users who

sign up for Debit Card Accounts to select a no-fee Jassby account plan for their Family (the “No Fee Plan”) or may

use the Service to subscribe to one or more premium service level plans (each a “Premium Service Level Plan”) (all

plan levels referred to collectively as “Plan Levels”). Premium Service Level Plans and the features offered under

each Plan Level are subject to change at any time. The monthly fee for any Premium Service Level Plan (the

“Monthly Fee”) and the features currently provided pursuant to each Plan Level will be described on our website.

Taxes may apply. When applicable, the Family Organizer is responsible for selecting the Family’s Plan Level and

may change the Family’s Plan Level at any time, but no more than once per monthly billing cycle. To change your

Family’s Plan Level, please visit the account details page in the App or contact Jassby customer service at

customersupport@jassby.com. If you downgrade your Plan Level, you will not be eligible for a partial refund for

the unused portion of the Monthly Fee associated with the remainder of the current monthly billing cycle.



A Premium Service Level Plan may enable Users to access certain features that are not available to Users who select

the No Fee Plan. For the full details of the Plan Levels currently offered and the features provided as part of each

Plan Level, please visit our website.



Jassby reserves the right to change, add, or eliminate the features offered under each Plan Level at any time, with

or without notice to you, and Jassby reserves the right to restrict your participation in any Plan Level at our sole

- 6 -

discretion. When you select a Premium Service Level Plan for your family, you agree to pay the Monthly Fee for

the corresponding Plan Level, as described on our website, in accordance with Section 3, Fees and Orders, of this

Agreement, until you have cancelled your Premium Service Level subscription in accordance with the cancellation

procedures described above.

to the Service or this Agreement (including the validity and scope of the agreement to arbitrate and any disputes

with other users of the Service) shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the

American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act, and shall be conducted before a

single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA (for information on the

AAA and its rules, see adr.org). You agree that the arbitration shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the

AAA or the arbitrator shall determine that venue in such city is unreasonably burdensome, in which case the AAA

or the arbitrator shall select a venue that is not unreasonably burdensome to both you and us. You agree that, if the

AAA shall be unavailable or decline to administer the arbitration, and the parties do not agree on a substitute, a

substitute administrator or arbitrator shall be appointed by the court. This provision shall not apply to claims of

patent, trademark, or copyright infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets. In addition, you or we may elect

to bring an individual claim in a small claims court, but we do not hereby agree to any personal jurisdiction that is

otherwise lacking.



You agree that any arbitration shall not permit claims on a class, mass, representative, or private attorney general

basis. You further agree that no claims of other parties may be consolidated with your or our claims in the arbitration

without both your and our consent. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED

BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, MASS, REPRESENTATIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY

GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION AGAINST US.



If any part of this Arbitration clause is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then it shall be severed and the

remaining portions of this section shall remain in effect, with the exception that if the preceding paragraph is deemed

invalid, then this entire section shall be deemed invalid and the arbitration clause shall be void.



17. Force Majeure. In no event will we be liable for any failure to comply with this Agreement to the

extent that such failure arises from factors outside our reasonable control. Without limitation of the foregoing, in

the absence of our gross negligence or willful misconduct we will not be liable for any damages arising from the

acts of hackers or similar bad actors interfering with the Service or accessing, using or disclosing any of your

content.



18. Compliance with Laws. You will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your activities

under or in connection with this Agreement, including without limitation United States export control laws,

regulations and executive orders.



19. Geography. We are based in the United States. We provide the Service for use only by persons located

in the United States. We make no claims that the Service or any of its content is accessible or appropriate outside

of the United States. Access to the Service may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access

the Service from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance

with local laws.



20. Miscellaneous Provisions. No delay or omission by us in exercising any of our rights occurring upon

any noncompliance or default by you with respect to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will impair

any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by us of any of the covenants, conditions or

agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any

other covenant, condition or agreement herein. No waiver will be binding on us unless made in an express writing

signed by us. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or

unenforceable, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and

enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise

expressly provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between us and you regarding its subject

matter, and supersedes all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such

subject matter. Your registration, this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder are not assignable, or

otherwise transferable or delegable, by you to any third party without our prior written consent in our sole discretion.

Any purported assignment, transfer or delegation without such consent will be null and void. We may assign or

otherwise transfer or delegate this Agreement (including any rights or obligations hereunder), including to any

purchaser of our business, from time-to-time in our sole discretion. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure

to the benefit of the parties’ successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may be executed electronically, and

your electronic assent or use of the Service shall constitute execution of this Agreement. You agree that the

electronic text of this Agreement constitutes a writing and your assent to the terms and conditions hereof constitutes

a “signing” for all purposes. As used herein and unless the intent is expressly otherwise in a specific instance, the

terms “include,” “includes” or “including” shall not be limiting and “or” shall not be exclusive. Any section

headings herein are for convenience only and do not form a part of, and will not be used in the interpretation of, the

substantive provisions of this Agreement. You agree that email to your email address on record will constitute

formal notice under this Agreement. There shall be no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

The Rewards Program is open to all Jassby users with an active Allowance Account or Debit Card Account.

Eligibility is subject to change at any time.



Earning Points



The Rewards Program allows you to earn points by engaging in various activities within the Service. The ways to

earn points, the number of points earned per activity, and the limits on points earned are subject to change at any

Redeeming Points



Points may be redeemed for funds deposited to the Spending Pocket of the Jassby Allowance Account or Debit

Card Account associated with the Rewards Program activity. Points may be redeemed on the Rewards account

detail page in the Jassby application. You may need to have a certain number of earned points before you can

Your participation in the Rewards Program may result in your receipt of taxable income from Jassby and we may

be required to send you, and file with the IRS, a Form 1099. You are responsible for any tax liability, including

disclosure requirements, related to your participation in the Rewards Program.



We are not responsible for any dispute you may have in connection with the Rewards Program with an authorized

Jassby may modify or update these Rewards Program Terms at any time, and each such modification will be

effective upon either posting on the Jassby website or notice to you and will replace all earlier versions of the

Rewards Program Terms. Your continued participation in the Rewards Program following any such modification

constitutes your acceptance of such modification and your continued agreement to be bound by these Rewards

Program Terms. If you do not agree to any modification of these Rewards Program Terms, your sole remedy is to

discontinue your participation in the Rewards Program. Jassby in its sole discretion may terminate this Rewards

Program at any time, with or without notice to you.
