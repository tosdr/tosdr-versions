Makariou III Ave, Vanezis Business Center, Office 401, 3027 Limassol, Cyprus) ("LEH").

PLEASE READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE BROWSING OR MAKING A PURCHASE FROM THIS WEBSITE ("USE"). THE TERMS MAY HAVE CHANGED SINCE YOUR LAST VISIT TO THIS SITE. YOUR CURRENT USE OF THIS WEBSITE CONFIRMS YOUR UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS FOR YOUR CURRENT USE. ONLY THE TERMS IN EFFECT AS OF A USE SHALL GOVERN FOR THAT PARTICULAR USE. EACH TIME YOU MAKE USE OF THE SITE, REVIEW THE TERMS AGAIN IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF AND ACCEPT THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE. You should print a copy of the Terms for future reference, since Terms may have changed since your last Use.

**GENERAL**

* These Terms shall govern your current Use of this website.  These Terms supersede all terms and conditions that may have been published previously on this site.
* If you are not 18 years old, please ask your parents or other adults whether you are of age to use this website and to order goods and/or services from it. There may be local laws that make it inappropriate for you to use this site or make purchases from it. You and the adults whom you must consult are solely responsible for determining if you may use this site lawfully.
* These Terms are subject to change at any time without notice.
* You acknowledge that you do not rely on any representation and/or warranty that has not been made in accordance with the Terms.
* LEH attempts to ensure that information on this website is complete, accurate and current. Despite LEH's efforts, the information on this website may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date.
* Descriptions, depictions, representations, and/or specifications for the products and/or services on offer at this website are intended as a guide only and only give a general approximation of the efficacy of the products and/or services.
* You shall use this website in a legal, honest, and inoffensive manner, in compliance with generally accepted internet usage practice from time to time, and in compliance with the prevailing standards of your own community.
* You shall not use this website and any service made available to you via this website to attempt to gain access to and/or interfere with the functioning, operation or security of any network and/or system or in order to monitor a third party's use of the internet.
* This website may offer online entertainment services that are adult in nature. It may contain graphic depictions and descriptions of explicit sexual activity and/or sell adult products. You acknowledge that you are aware of the nature of the content on this site, that you are not offended by it, and that you access this site voluntarily.
* These Terms are organized under titles in order to group information into "user-friendly" categories. The titles are not to be used for purposes of interpreting the Terms.

**ORDERS**

1. We have the right to refuse to accept any orders placed for Leading Edge Health's products and services. Your order for products shall only be binding on us when you receive confirmation that a product has shipped. If we refuse your order, your money will be returned in full.
2. You are responsible for the accuracy of all information you provide that is necessary for us to process your order and/or ship your order to the correct location. If an order has not been shipped, or shipped to an incorrect location due to such inaccuracy, you alone are responsible.
3. The provision of products and services is subject to availability. If products are out of stock, Leading Edge Health will inform you as soon as possible. You will be given the option of waiting until the products are in stock or of canceling your order.
4. If you have any problems or concerns regarding Leading Edge Health's products, you can reach us via the customer service contact information supplied on this website.
5. Dates for delivery are estimates only and are not guaranteed. Time is not of the essence in relation to such dates. They are also subject to any matter beyond our reasonable control.
6. If a delivery requires a signature to confirm receipt, it is your responsibility to ensure that there is someone at the delivery address to sign for the products when delivered. It is also your responsibility to collect the products from any postal collection depot and/or arrange an alternative delivery date if you are not available to sign for the products.
7. If you place your order by post, please complete the order form and send it to us, along with payment, to the address given. We have no liability to you in respect of orders that do not reach us.
8. Any products purchased are for personal use only. The products cannot be resold and cannot be given to any third party.
9. You hereby agree that any resale of goods you purchase from this site constitutes trademark and copyright infringement and is not protected under the “first-sale” doctrine because of the “material difference” and “quality controls” exceptions to the “first-sale” doctrine.
10. You further agree that resale by you makes you automatically liable for a $5,000.00 damages payment (five thousand U.S. Dollars) to LEH, which is enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. This is not intended as a penalty but rather as an estimation of harm that is difficult to gauge precisely (liquidated damages). There is equal bargaining power between us because this is not a product that you are obligated to purchase, and you are put on clear notice prior to purchasing the product.
11. We are not responsible for safe delivery of goods because we do not ship the products directly. If the products are not delivered, arrive late, or are damaged in transit, you must take this up with the carrier. We will provide you with their contact details upon request.
12. Payment is due at the time you place your order.
13. We do not accept your order until we receive notice from our credit card merchant that your payment has been authorized and/or we have received payment in full in cleared funds.
14. If for any reason payment in full is not made, we may withhold or suspend delivery of the products.
