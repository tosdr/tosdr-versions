CyberLynk services, including all related equipment, networks and network devices are provided only for authorized customer use. CyberLynk systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including ensuring that use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and used for authorized purposes. Use of CyberLynk system(s) constitutes consent to monitoring for these purposes.

Any account found connecting to a third party network or system without authorization from the third party is subject to suspension. Access to networks or systems outside of your direct control must be with expressed written consent from the third party. CyberLynk may, at its discretion, request and require documentation to prove access to a third party network or system is authorized.

We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Any material that, in our judgment, is obscene, threatening, illegal, or violates our terms of service in any manner may be removed from our servers (or otherwise disabled), with or without notice.

Failure to respond to email from our abuse department within 8 hours may result in the suspension or termination of your services. All abuse issues must be dealt with via trouble ticket/email and will have a response within 8 hours.

Sites hosted on CyberLynk.net’s and our Family of Technology Company service(s) are regulated only by U.S. law. Given this fact, and pursuant to Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act, we do not remove allegedly defamatory material from domains hosted on our service(s). The only exception to this rule is if the material has been found to be defamatory by a court, as evidenced by a court order. CyberLynk.net is not in a position to investigate and validate or invalidate the veracity of individual defamation claims, which is why we rely on the legal system and courts to determine whether or not material is indeed considered defamatory. In any case in which a court order indicates material is defamatory, libelous, or slanderous in nature; we will disable access to the material. Similarly, in any case in which a US Court has placed an injunction against specified content or material; we will comply and remove or disable access to the material in question.

The language of Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act fundamentally states that Internet service providers like CyberLynk.net and many of CyberLynk.net’s other webhosting services and brands are republishers and not the publisher of content. Our service merely provides a hosting platform and space on which to host content, and any creation or publication of content on our services is the sole responsibility of the third-party user which creates or publishes the content. Therefore, CyberLynk.net should not be held liable for any allegedly defamatory, offensive or harassing content published on sites hosted under CyberLynk.net’s webhosting service(s).

If in doubt regarding the acceptability of your site or service please contact us at abuse@CyberLynk.net and we will be happy to assist you.

Potential harm to minors is strictly forbidden, including but not limited to child pornography or content perceived to be child pornography (Lolita):

Any site found to host child pornography or linking to child pornography will be suspended immediately without notice.

Resellers: we will suspend the site in question and will notify you so you may terminate the account. We will further monitor your activity; more than one infraction of this type may result in the immediate termination of your account.

Direct customers: Your services will be terminated with or without notice.

Violations will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of installation method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive as possible. Users are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under their account. This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. It is required that you use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will notify you and allow time for you to change/update your password.

2.) General Service Resources
-----------------------------

Resource Usage

User may not:

* Use 25% or more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.
* Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.
* Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.
* Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.
* Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.
* Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities
* Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc.
* Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes.
* Run any MySQL queries longer than 15 seconds. MySQL tables should be indexed appropriately.
* When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the
* local file rather than the URL. Instead of include("http://yourdomain.com/include.php") use include("include.php")
* To help reduce usage, do not force html to handle server-side code (like php and shtml).
* Only use https protocol when necessary; encrypting and decrypting communications is noticeably more CPU-intensive than unencrypted communications.

Backup Policy

For its own operational efficiencies and purposes, CyberLynk from time to time backs up data on its servers, but is under no obligation or duty to Subscriber to do so under these Terms. IT IS SOLELY SUBSCRIBER’S DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BACKUP SUBSCRIBER’S FILES AND DATA ON CYBERLYNK SERVERS, AND under no circumstance will CYBERLYNK be liable to anyone FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND under any legal theory for loss of Subscriber FILES AND/or data on any CyberLynk server. CyberLynk will not attempt to back up accounts that exceed 50,000 files or 30 Gigs of space for any reason.

Unless the customer has specifically purchased a backup solution for website & email hosting, VPS, Dedicated server or colocation hosting services it is solely the subscriber’s duty and responsibility to backup subscriber’s files and data.

Zero Tolerance Spam Policy

We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail, bulk emailing, and spam. “Safe lists”, purchased lists, and selling of lists will be treated as spam. Any user who sends out spam will have their account terminated with or without notice.

Sites advertised via SPAM (Spamvertised) may not be hosted on our servers. This provision includes, but is not limited to SPAM sent via fax, phone, postal mail, email, instant messaging, or usenet/newsgroups. No organization or entity listed in the ROKSO may be hosted on our servers. Any account which results in our IP space being blacklisted will be immediately suspended and/or terminated.

CyberLynk reserves the right to require changes or disable as necessary any web site, account, database, or other component that does not comply with its established policies, or to make any such modifications in an emergency at its sole discretion.

CyberLynk reserves the right to charge the holder of the account used to send any unsolicited e-mail a cleanup fee or any charges incurred for blacklist removal. This cost of the cleanup fee is entirely at the discretion of CyberLynk.

General Shared & VPS Hosting Email Policy

There is a 500 outgoing email hourly limit per domain. This limit is also applied towards Mailman. If you send over this amount in any hour, most of the e-mails will bounce back with an undeliverable error. If this occurs, it will then take some time for your account to be able to send again so we recommend waiting at least 1 hour after this issue occurs to begin sending email again.

Many of our servers have a limit of 30 POP3/IMAP checks per hour per each user’s connecting IP address. If you go over this you’re likely to get a wrong password error message or an error stating “login incorrect”. If this occurs, please wait an hour and it will automatically unblock you. To prevent this from happening again, please make sure to disable auto checking or at least set it to something higher such as once every 10 minutes.

Any mailing list larger than 5,000 addresses will require a dedicated server or VPS hosting solution from us. Note: Dividing one large list into smaller lists to get below this limit is not allowed.

Mailing Lists Rules

1\. Any time you’re sending a message no matter how large your e-mail list is you must throttle it. We recommend you throttle it to at the very least sending 1 email every 8 seconds. (Sending 1 every 8 seconds would send 450 emails within 1 hour, keeping you below the 500 outgoing email limit.) If the mailing list software you’re using does not allow you to throttle you must switch to an application or script that will. We recommend PHPList, which can be found in your CPanel under Softalicous.

IMPORTANT: If you do not throttle and you try sending 500 emails, the server will try sending all 500 in 1 second which is not possible on our shared servers. This will cause a very high load on the server and the entire server will be sluggish, potentially affecting your sites and service, until this sending process is completed. It is our job to keep the server up and running without being sluggish or experiencing issues. Anyone who causes the server’s load to go high will be suspended and the process will be terminated. If you choose not to throttle, you will most likely be suspended for crashing the server.

2\. Any mailing list over 900 email addresses is only allowed to be sent to during off-peak times to prevent high server loads. Off peak times qualify as all day Saturday and Sunday, and 1AM – 8AM Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday.

3\. The list must be a Double Opt-In list. This means a user has subscribed for a newsletter or other email marketing messages by explicitly requesting it and confirming the email address to be their own. Confirmation is usually done by responding to a notification/confirmation email sent to the email address the end user specified. The double opt-in method eliminates the chance of abuse where somebody submits someone else’s email address without their knowledge and against their will. You will not be permitted to mail any mailing list that you were given or purchased. In doing so, this will also be considered spamming and may result in termination of the offending account.

Email Scripts must be able to handle and document all information from a double opt-in list. This includes processing opt-outs (via web or email) and list removal on bounce backs. All opt-outs or bounce back removals must be handled in a timely manner, and outbound mail must be throttled on shared plans to a maximum of five hundred (500) emails per hour. If your account is found to be using a script that does not meet these requirements, CyberLynk reserves the right to suspend, terminate, or deactivate your script or account.

4\. Any unsolicited e-mail being sent will result in suspension or termination of the offending account. We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail and other forms of spam.

5\. Any mailing list MUST comply with all guidelines set forth by the United States government. These can be found at:

http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/ecommerce/bus61.shtm .

6\. No direct SMTP mailers are allowed. An example of this would be a Darkmailer or The Bat!. Any mail should be sent through the local mail server/MTA for further delivery by the server and not done directly by scripts.

General Dedicated & Colocation Email Policy
-------------------------------------------

1\. The list must be a Double Opt-In list. This means a user has subscribed for a newsletter or other email marketing messages by explicitly requesting it and confirming the email address to be their own. Confirmation is usually done by responding to a notification/confirmation email sent to the email address the end user specified. The double opt-in method eliminates the chance of abuse where somebody submits someone else’s email address without their knowledge and against their will. You will not be permitted to mail any mailing list that you were given or purchased. In doing so, this will also be considered spamming and may result in termination of the offending account.

2\. Any unsolicited e-mail being sent will result in suspension or termination of the offending account. We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail and other forms of spam.

3\. Any mailing list MUST comply with all guidelines set forth by the United States government. These can be found at:

http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/ecommerce/bus61.shtm .

3.) Bandwidth Usage

You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting plan you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of plan, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.

What “Unlimited” means. CyberLynk does not set an arbitrary limit or cap on the amount of resources a single Subscriber can use. In good faith and subject to these Terms, CyberLynk makes every commercially reasonable effort to provide its Subscribers with all the storage and bandwidth resources needed to power their web sites successfully, as long as the Subscriber’s use of the service complies with these Terms. By not setting limits on key resources, we are able to provide simple, consistent pricing to our Subscribers as they grow their online presence. As a result, a typical web presence may experience periods of great popularity and resulting increased storage without experiencing any associated increase in hosting charges.

What “Unlimited” DOES NOT mean. CyberLynk employs complex mechanisms to protect its Subscribers and systems from abuse. CyberLynk’s offering of “unlimited” services is not intended to allow the actions of a single or few Subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other Subscribers.

CyberLynk’s service is a shared hosting service, which means that multiple Subscriber web sites are hosted from the same server and share server resources. CyberLynk’s service is designed to meet the typical needs of small business and home business website Subscribers in the United States. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, internationally based businesses, or non-typical applications better suited to a dedicated server. CyberLynk will make every commercially reasonable effort to provide additional resources to Subscribers who are using their website(s) consistent with these Terms, including moving Subscribers to newer and bigger shared servers as necessary. However, in order to ensure a consistent and quality experience for all Subscribers, CyberLynk does place automated safeguards to protect against any one site growing too quickly and adversely impacting the system until CyberLynk can evaluate said sites resource needs.

Unlimited Hosting Space; excessive MySQL files. CyberLynk does not set arbitrary limits on the amount of disk space a Subscriber can use for the Subscriber’s website, nor does CyberLynk charge additional fees based on an increased amount of storage used, provided the Subscriber’s use of storage complies with these Terms. Please note, however, that the CyberLynk service is designed to host websites. CyberLynk does NOT provide unlimited space for online storage, backups, or archiving of electronic files, documents, log files, etc., and any such prohibited use of the Services will result in the termination of Subscriber’s account, with or without notice. Accounts with a large number of files (inode count in excess of 200,000) can have an adverse effect on server performance. Similarly, accounts with an excessive number of MySQL/PostgreSQL tables (i.e., in excess of 1000 database tables) or of database size (i.e., in excess of 3GB total MySQL/PostgreSQL usage or 2GB MySQL/PostgreSQL usage in a single database) negatively affect the performance of the server. CyberLynk may request that the number of files/inodes, database tables, or total database usage be reduced to ensure proper performance or may terminate the Subscriber’s account, with or without notice.

Unlimited File Transfer. If the hosting plan states ‘Unlimited File Transfer’ CyberLynk does not set arbitrary limits on the amount of visitor traffic a web site, VPS or dedicated server can receive or on the amount of content a Subscriber can upload to his/her/its website, VPS or dedicated server in a given month, nor does CyberLynk charge additional fees based on increased use of bandwidth, as long as the Subscriber’s use of the Services complies with these Terms. In most cases, a Subscriber’s web site will be able to support as much traffic as the Subscriber can legitimately acquire. However, CyberLynk reserves the right to limit processor time, bandwidth, processes, or memory in cases where it is necessary to prevent negatively impacting other Subscribers.

Unlimited Domain Hosting. CyberLynk does not set arbitrary limits on the number of domain names a Subscriber can associate with the Subscriber’s web hosting account.
