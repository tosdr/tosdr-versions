5\. ABOUT OUR ADS
-----------------

The Application uses common tracking tools that allow the Application to feature advertisements and content that are relevant to you and usually are presented by our partner advertisers or advertising networks. These ads and content are presented based on your actions on the Application as well as your other online activities. This is called interest-based or behavioral advertising – advertising that uses information collected on an individual’s web browsing or mobile application behavior (including your engagement with advertisements and the Application) in order to target advertising or content to the user based on this behavior. This information is then used to select which advertisements or content are displayed to you on the Application.

If Personal Information is voluntarily provided by you and collected in the Application via an advertisement, that Personal Information is collected and used solely by us or the relevant advertiser, not any network that served the advertisement to the Application.

Airfind adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (DAA Self-Regulatory Principles).

You have a choice about receiving interest-based ads and content. See Opting Out for more information.

6\. MANAGE YOUR PREFERENCES
---------------------------

### I. ACCESSING & CHANGING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION

You may access and change your Account Information directly in the Application. To do this, open the Application, click Settings and then click View Profile.

### II. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

We may send you e-mails to promote the use of our Services. When you receive those e-mails, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive, by terminating your Account or by contacting us directly at [support@smoreapp.co](mailto:support@smoreapp.co).

**Push Notifications**

Certain services may give you the option to receive push notifications. In order to serve push notifications, we may need to collect both your IP address and a persistent identifier from your device. You can turn push notifications on or off by modifying the settings within the applicable service, or within your device’s settings.

These choices do not apply to the display of online advertising or the receipt of mandatory service communications that are considered part of the Services, which you may receive periodically unless you close your Account.

### III. OPTING OUT

We understand that, at a future date, you may no longer want to have your information collected and used to receive interest-based ads or content on the Application or to have your device’s precise location data collected. If you do not agree to this collection, transfer and use, you may disable location-based services in your device settings. Use of precise location is not required for the Application. However failure to provide it will limit relevant content and functionality of the Application.

The DAA offers AppChoices, a separate choice tool for users to exercise control over the collection and use of data across and through mobile applications for interest-based advertising and other related uses. To exercise choice for participating companies, you can install the DAA’s AppChoices application on your mobile device. Visit here for more information on DAA’s AppChoices tool athttp://youradchoices.com/appchoices.

Nevertheless, without this information, we won’t be able to provide you with enough interesting or relevant content on the Application, which means you will not have a meaningful opportunity to earn points. Therefore, to “opt out” of allowing the future collection, use and transfer of your behavioral information or the device’s precise location information, you must **stop using and un-install the Application from your mobile device.**
