-------------------------------

At 1happykiddo, it’s our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to [1happykiddo.com](https://1happykiddo.com/) (hereinafter, “us”, “we”, or “1happykiddo.com”).

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website.

We’ve adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through our website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.

This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Service posted on our website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our website.

Depending on your activities when visiting our website, you may be required to agree to additional terms of service.

Website visitors
----------------

Like most website operators, 1happykiddo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

1happykiddo’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the website.

From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

1happykiddo also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://1happykiddo.com blog posts.

1happykiddo only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Gathering of personally-identifying information
-----------------------------------------------

Certain visitors to our website choose to interact with 1happykiddo in ways that require us to gather personally identifying information.

The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction.

Security
--------

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Advertisements
--------------

Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.

This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by 1happykiddo and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Links to external sites
-----------------------

We may share links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site.

Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and [Terms of Service](https://1happykiddo.com/terms/) of every site you visit.

Mediavine programmatic advertising (ver 1.1)
--------------------------------------------

1happykiddo works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies.

A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.

First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting.

Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, “Tags”) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising.

Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser’s cache. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache.

For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at [All About Cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the 1happykiddo content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site.

In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on 1happykiddo.

The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:

* IP Address
* Operating System type
* Operating System version
* Device Type
* Language of the website
* Web browser type
* Email (in hashed form)

Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements.

Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps.

This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor’s referral source to a particular website.

Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.
