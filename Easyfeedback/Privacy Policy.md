_Article 15_

**Right of access by the data subject**

1\. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:

(a) the purposes of the processing;

(b) the categories of personal data concerned;

(c) the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;

(d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;

(e) the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;

(f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

(g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;

(h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

2\. Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer.

3\. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form.

4\. The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

_Article 16_

**Right to rectification**

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.

_Article 17_

**Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)**

1\. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:

(a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;

(b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;

(c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2);

(d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed;

(e) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject;

(f) the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1).

2\. Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:

(a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;

(b) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

(c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3);

(d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or

(e) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

_Article 18_

**Right to restriction of processing**

1\. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:

(a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;

(b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead;

(c) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;

(d) the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.

2\. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the data subject’s consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.

3\. A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted.

_Article 19_

**Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing**

The controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 16, Article 17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it.

_Article 20_

**Right to data portability**

1\. The data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where:

(a) the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1); and

(b) the processing is carried out by automated means.

2\. In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.

3\. The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be without prejudice to Article 17. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

4\. The right referred to in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

_Article 21_

**Right to object**

1\. The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions.

We use the “Zoom” tool to hold telephone conferences, online meetings, video conferences and / or webinars (hereinafter: “Online Meetings”). “Zoom” is a service provided by Zoom Video Communications, Inc., which is based in the United States.

Easyfeedback GmbH is responsible for data processing that is directly related to the implementation of “online meetings”.  
Note: If you access the “Zoom” website, the provider of “Zoom” is responsible for the data processing.

When using “Zoom” different types of data are processed. The scope of the data also depends on the information you provide about data before or when participating in an “online meeting”.

The following personal data are processed:

User information: first name, last name, telephone (optional), email address, password (if “single sign-on” is not used), profile picture (optional),  
Department (optional)  
Meeting metadata: topic, description (optional), participant IP addresses, device / hardware information

For recordings (optional): MP4 file of all video, audio and presentation recordings, M4A file of all audio recordings, text file of the online meeting chat.

When dialing in with the phone: information on the incoming and outgoing phone number, country name, start and end time. If necessary, further connection data such as the IP address of the device can be saved.

Text, audio and video data: You may have the option of using the chat, question or survey functions in an “online meeting”. In this respect, the text entries you make are processed in order to display them in the “online meeting” and, if necessary, to record them. In order to enable the display of video and the playback of audio, the data from the microphone of your terminal device and any video camera on the terminal device are processed accordingly for the duration of the meeting. You can switch off or mute the camera or microphone yourself at any time using the “Zoom” applications.

In order to take part in an “online meeting” or to enter the “meeting room”, you must at least provide information about your name.

Scope of processing  
We use “Zoom” to conduct “online meetings”. If we want to record “online meetings”, we will inform you transparently in advance and – if necessary – ask for your consent. The fact of the recording is also displayed in the “Zoom” app.

If necessary for the purpose of logging the results of an online meeting, we will log the chat content. However, this will usually not be the case.

If you are registered as a user with “Zoom”, reports on “Online Meetings” (meeting metadata, data on dialing in, questions and answers in webinars, survey function in webinars) can be saved in “Zoom” for up to one month.

Automated decision-making within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR is not used.

Legal basis for data processing  
Insofar as personal data is processed by employees of Mustermann GmbH, Section 26 BDSG is the legal basis for data processing. If, in connection with the use of “Zoom”, personal data are not required for the establishment, implementation or termination of the employment relationship, but are nevertheless an elementary component when using “Zoom”, Article 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR is applicable the legal basis for data processing. In these cases, we are interested in the effective implementation of “online meetings”.  
In addition, the legal basis for data processing when conducting “online meetings” is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR, insofar as the meetings are held in the context of contractual relationships.  
If there is no contractual relationship, the legal basis is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f) GDPR. Here, too, we are interested in the effective implementation of “online meetings”.

Recipient / transfer of data  
Personal data that are processed in connection with participation in “online meetings” are generally not passed on to third parties unless they are specifically intended to be passed on. Please note that content from “online meetings”, as well as from personal meeting meetings, is often used to communicate information with customers, interested parties or third parties and is therefore intended to be passed on.  
Other recipients: The provider of “Zoom” necessarily receives knowledge of the above data, insofar as this is provided for in our order processing contract with “Zoom”.

Data processing outside the European Union  
“Zoom” is a service that is provided by a provider from the USA. Processing of personal data also takes place in a third country. We have concluded an order processing contract with the provider of “Zoom” which meets the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.  
On the one hand, an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed by the conclusion of the so-called EU standard contractual clauses. As a supplementary protective measure, we have also made our zoom configuration so that only data centers in the EU, the EEA or secure third countries such as Canada or Japan are used for the implementation of “online meetings”.

In addition, visual and audio contributions from participants as well as voice input in chats can be processed. This may also involve transmission to the servers of Google LLC. in the USA.

If you have given us your consent to process your data, the processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

Social networks such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or banner ads). When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:

If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.

Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.

Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals.

Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.

**Legal basis**

Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).

**Responsibility and assertion of rights**

If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g. Facebook).

Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company policy of the respective provider.

**Storage time**

The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as the purpose for their storage lapses, you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular, retention periods – remain unaffected.
