This authorisation does not alter the lawful basis for processing determined by our client. Furthermore, should you withdraw or withhold this authorisation it will have no bearing on our client’s lawful basis for screening.

If your offer of a role is dependent upon successfully undergoing screening (or if screening is required under your existing contract) then failure to authorise Accurate to process your personal data for screening purposes may have implications on your contractual relationship with our client. Accurate are not involved in any decisions relating to your contractual relationship with our client and can take no responsibility for any actions taken by our client in connection with the screening process.

Should you wish to know more as to the required checks or verifications relating to your screening, we recommend you contact the relevant HR contact at the client who instructed Accurate to carry out the screening exercise.

We use your personal data in the following ways:

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.<br><br>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify our clients and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.<br><br>As part of the services we offer to our clients, the personal data you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). By way of example, this may happen if we are asked by our client to check your references for time spent working outside of the EEA and we engage a service provider based in the appropriate jurisdiction to perform the checks on our behalf. If Accurate transfers your personal data outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Accurate recognises that some countries do not have the same standard of data protection afforded in most EU States, for this reason Accurate has a strict supplier management policy which includes the screening of all new suppliers, annual security questionnaires and reviews, and the use of formal processing agreements. Our processing agreements also include terms dictating that the suppliers:<br><br>* are only permitted to process your personal data for employment screening purposes;<br>* can only retain your personal data for a maximum period of 90 days (unless they are restricted by law from doing this) following which they must securely delete such records;<br>* must immediately notify Accurate of any suspected or actual data breach of your personal data;<br>* shall take all appropriate technical and security measures to safeguard your personal data; and<br>* will only transfer your personal data in accordance with approved data transfer provisions. |

| Data retention |

| We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, as determined by our client, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.<br><br>In relation to the screening report and information gathered during the course of the screening, our client specifies the required data retention period for electronic/paper records. Subject to our legal and regulatory requirements, our screening platform will securely delete your personal data. In the case of disposal of hard copy papers (typically pertaining to UK criminal record checks) these are managed by way of secure confidential waste bins installed on-site and secure on-site shredding; the destruction of all confidential waste is carried out to BS15713:2009 security shredding standard by appropriately vetted members of staff.<br><br>Should you wish to request further information relating to the relevant retention period of your records please contact the relevant HR contact at the client who instructed Accurate to undertake the screening exercise. |

* * *

### Candidate portal screening form – Export-Import

You can download a copy of the data you input into your Candidate portal screening form in a machine-readable pdf format. Please note, your Candidate portal account will be scheduled for automatic purging 30 days after the screening exercise has been completed regardless of whether you have exported your data or not. However, the Client portal copy of your screening (including screening form, report and attachments) will be retained in accordance with the data controller’s chosen retention period. This is typically 12 months from screening completion.

* * *

* the right to information;
* the right to rectification;

In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent.
