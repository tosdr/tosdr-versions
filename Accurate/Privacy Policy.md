Our legal basis for processing information that we collect about you through our Website is our legitimate interest as a data controller to administer our Website.  In the case of processing involving passive data collection and other processing for the administration of our Website, such processing is undertaken pursuant to our legitimate interests as a data controller, including the operation of our Website. We may process personal data where necessary for our compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject. We also reserve the right to process personal data in the event we believe doing so is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject or another person.  In cases where you are asked to provide your consent, you can decline to provide it, although you may not be able to proceed with your application or other activity for which consent was requested.  In cases where you provide consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time, although processing carried out under previously given consent remains valid unless you request deletion of the data.

Under Article 18 of Brazil’s General Law for Data Protection (LGPD), individuals have certain rights with respect to personal data about them that is being processed by controllers, including: confirmation of the existence of processing; access to personal data about them; correction of incomplete, inaccurate or out of date data; anonymization, blocking or deletion of data that is unnecessary, excessive or not processed in accordance with the LGPD; data portability; deletion of personal data; and information about third parties with whom the controller has shared personal data to the extent these are required by law.  In cases where we are acting as a processor, rather than a controller, we may need to refer your request to the controller.

If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact our Vice-President of Compliance using the contact information below.  You have the right to object to the processing of personal data about you and the right to file a complaint with Brazilian data protection and consumer defense authorities if you have concern about the way we are processing your personal data.

Additional Information for Individuals in California

The California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act  provide certain rights to California residents(collectively referred to as “CCPA” for the purposes of this privacy policy).  However, the CCPA provides an exception for information gathered and processed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”).  Most of the personal information we collect is for the purpose of providing a background report under the FCRA.  In those circumstances, we will process and store your information in accordance with our obligations under the FCRA (or the equivalent state law).   The FCRA provides you with the opportunity to request a disclosure and/or reinvestigation when applicable.

While the CCPA provides the exception for data collected under the FCRA, the CCPA will still apply to California residents who are users of our Website, Accurate employees or Accurate customers.  Accurate does not sell your personal information, although Accurate may share your information.  Please refer to the sections regarding how we collect, use, share, and store your information for more information regarding the use of personal information.

Unless there is an FCRA exemption or Accurate is acting as a service provider or processor, California residents have the following rights:

* Right to know what categories of personal data have been collected and disclosed, sold or shared within the past 12 months
* Right to access your personal data
* Right to request a deletion of certain personal data unless such data is subject to an exemption or Accurate is acting as service provider or processor
* Right to equal services and non-discrimination
* Request we do not sell or share your information

Accurate Background will revise or update this privacy policy on occasion to reflect changes to our practices. If we make any material changes, we will provide notification through our Website prior to the change taking effect. You should refer back to this page for the latest information. The date at the start of this privacy policy will be updated any time a change is made.
