9.  **Compliance with FTC Guidelines on Endorsements/Testimonials**

If you choose to promote our services to the public, including your own personal social networks, you agree that you will comply with the FTC’s Guidelines Concerning the Use of Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising (available at [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf)) (“Guidelines”).

For example, if you have been paid or provided with free products in exchange for discussing or promoting a Rockhill product or service, or if you are an employee of a company and you decide to discuss or promote that company’s products or services through the Rockhill services, you agree to comply with the Guidelines’ requirements for disclosing such relationships. You, and not Rockhill, are solely responsible for any endorsements or testimonials you make regarding any product or service made on or through Rockhill’s services.

10.  **Binding Arbitration of all Disputes**
11. **Providing Notice of a Claim.**The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between them (“Disputes or Claims”). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (1) Disputes or Claims related in any way to any Rockhill Sites and Features or our Service, privacy, data security, collection, use and sharing, advertising, purchase transactions, points earnings, awards, balances, expiration, or transactions, sweepstakes, promotions, or any emails, texts, or other communications with you; (2) Disputes or Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the transactions or relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (3) Disputes or Claims that arose before your agreement to these Terms of Use or any prior arbitration agreement; (4) Disputes or Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (5) Disputes or Claims that may arise after the termination of your use of any Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by electronic mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). Notice to us must be sent to [finance@rockhillnetwork.com](mailto:finance@rockhillnetwork.com), Attention: Legal Department. The Notice must include: (1) the nature and basis of your Dispute or Claim; (2) identification or enclosure of all relevant documents and information; and (3) a description of the specific relief that you seek from us.

1. **Providing Us an Opportunity to Informally Resolve Your Dispute.** Before you may pursue or participate in any Dispute or Claim (or raise such Dispute or Claim as a defense) in small claims court or in arbitration against us, you must first send the Notice described above, and you must allow us a reasonable opportunity (not less than thirty (30) days) to resolve your Dispute or Claim. After we receive your Notice, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to resolve your Dispute or Claim.
2. **Agreement to Participate in Binding Arbitration.** If the parties do not reach an informal resolution of your Dispute or Claim within thirty (30) days after we receive your written Notice, you may pursue your Dispute or Claim in arbitration or, solely to the extent specifically provided below, in small claims court. If the parties cannot reach an informal resolution to the Dispute or Claim within thirty (30) days after our receipt of your Notice, you may commence an arbitration proceeding by sending an arbitration demand (“Arbitration Demand”) to the following address: [finance@rockhillnetwork.com](mailto:finance@rockhillnetwork.com) Attention: Legal Department. The parties agree to arbitrate any Dispute or Claim between them, except to the extent either party chooses to instead pursue the Dispute or Claim in small claims court as provided below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators generally can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.

Except as otherwise provided herein, upon either party filing an Arbitration Demand, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees, unless your Dispute or Claim exceeds $75,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees or other fees or expenses). If you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees or other fees or expenses) in damages, the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) will govern the payment of these fees. The AAA Rules, as modified by these Rules, will govern the arbitration. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. If your Dispute or Claim is for $10,000 or less (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees or other fees or expenses), we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules. If your Dispute or Claim exceeds $10,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees or other fees or expenses), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Furthermore, if AAA at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, the Company agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this arbitration provision, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of language in bold type below requiring individual arbitration and prohibiting class, representative or consolidated arbitration proceedings.

Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) in which you reside (except that, if you reside outside of the United States, any such hearings will take place in New York County, New York). One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules and who has expertise in consumer disputes in the Internet industry, will conduct the arbitration. If no arbitrator possessing such expertise is available, then the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who is selected by the mutual written approval of the parties. Except as allowed under applicable law and the AAA Rules, the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties. Judgment upon any award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. This provision will be specifically enforceable in any court. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES).

All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided herein, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute or Claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. Also, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

We may make a written settlement offer to you before the arbitrator issues an award. If, after the arbitrator finds in your favor on the merits of the claim, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than our written offer, we will: (1) pay you the greater of the amount of the award or $7,500 (“Alternative Payment”); and (2) pay your attorney, if you use an attorney, twice the amount of any reasonable attorneys’ fees awarded by the arbitrator, and reimburse any expenses that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your arbitration claim (“Attorney Fee Premium”). The Attorney Fee Premium does not supplant any right you may have to reasonable attorneys’ fees under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a greater amount under applicable law, the Attorney Fee Premium does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. You may not, however, recover duplicative attorneys’ fees or costs. If we do not make a written settlement offer to you before the arbitrator issues an award, you and your attorney will be entitled to the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee Premium, respectively, if the arbitrator decides in your favor on the merits. We agree that we will not seek any award of attorneys’ fees, even if we are entitled to such fees. The arbitrator may make any determinations and resolve any Dispute or Claim as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, the Alternative Payment, or the Attorney Fee Premium at any time during the proceeding and within fourteen (14) days after the arbitrator’s final ruling on the merits. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Furthermore, these arbitration provisions shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

**YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT:**

* **ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. NEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY SHALL BE A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE OR CLAIM.**
* **UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S DISPUTES OR CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.**
* **COMPANY DOES NOT CONSENT TO CLASS ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, IF A COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE THE ABOVE PROVISIONS REGARDING CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO YOU. WHETHER A DISPUTE OR CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.**

This arbitration agreement covers any Dispute or Claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between the parties, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, even if the Dispute or Claim arises or may arise before or after the period(s) during which you are using the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to “the Company”, “we” and “us” include Prodege, LLC, MyPoints.com, LLC, and each of their affiliates, and each such entity’s respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, suppliers and assignees. The AAA Rules evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this section.

**The parties must bring any Dispute or Claim hereunder (including any Dispute or Claim arising out of or related to the AAA Rules), within two (2) years after the Dispute or Claim arises, or the Dispute or Claim will be permanently barred.** To the extent the law applicable under the Governing Law section below makes this limitations period unenforceable with respect to any Dispute(s) or Claim(s), then the statutes of limitations of the state whose laws govern the AAA Rules under the Governing Law section below shall apply.

We may make changes to this arbitration provision from time to time. You may reject any material changes by sending us written objection within thirty (30) days of the change to [finance@rockhillnetwork.com](mailto:finance@rockhillnetwork.com) , Attention: Legal Department. By rejecting any future material change, you are agreeing to arbitrate in accordance with the language of this provision. If you do not send written objection to any change as provided above, you are agreeing to arbitration in accordance with the changed language of this provision. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to this arbitration provision to any Disputes or Claims relating to prior events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract or otherwise violate your legal rights, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the effective date of such changes, and in that case any Disputes or Claims relating to such prior events or circumstances shall be arbitrated in accordance with the language of this provision without such changes to the extent necessary to avoid these Terms being deemed illusory or unenforceable.

1. **Small Claims Court.** You may choose to pursue your Dispute or Claim in small claims court rather than by arbitration if your Dispute or Claim qualifies for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over you and us is proper.
2. **Governing Law.**The AAA Rules, and any Dispute or Claim arising between you and the Company related in any way to the AAA Rules or any Rockhill Sites and Features or our Service, privacy, data security, collection, use and sharing, advertising, purchase transactions, points earnings, awards, balances, expiration, or transactions, sweepstakes, promotions, or any emails, texts, or other communications with you, or arising out of or relating to any aspect of the transactions or relationship between us, whether based on contract, tort, statute, or common law, will be governed by the internal laws of the state in which you reside (except that, if you reside outside of the United States, the internal laws of the State of New York will govern), without regard to choice of law principles.
3.  **Tax Matters**

You acknowledge and agree that we do not have the ability, in every instance, to determine whether or not the points, rewards, prizes, or credits you earned or redeemed in any Rewards Program are considered reportable taxable earnings in your jurisdiction. You are therefore responsible for any and all tax liability arising from or associated with your use of the Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services. As a condition of your continued use of the Rockhill Sites and Features and our Services, we reserve the right to require you to provide necessary tax reporting information if our records show that you are or may be required to report the value of your points, rewards, prizes, or credits to an appropriate tax authority. We encourage you, and it is your responsibility, to seek advice of a tax expert in order to determine the tax consequences of your use of the Rockhill Sites and Features and our Services, and any associated points, rewards, prizes, or credits earned or redeemed.

12.  **Notification of Changes**

We reserve the right to make changes to these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we decide to change these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes by sending you an administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the Rockhill Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always aware of the terms of their use of the Rockhill Sites and Features and our Services. Your continued use of any of the Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services after delivery of the administrative email to you or after the changes are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, please discontinue your use of such Rockhill Sites and Features and our Services. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to these Terms to any prior events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid these Terms being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if you used any of the Rockhill Sites and Features or our Services pursuant to a prior version of these Terms that required a certain notice period to you prior to any changes being effective, any changes under these Terms will not be effective as to you until the previously-specified notice period has passed after the date of these Terms.
