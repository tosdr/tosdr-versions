If you disagree with any part hereof then you may not access the Why Toyz Website and/or the Why Toyz Worlds and/or the Products and/or the Services.

Part of this no nonsense approach is you provide with as much information about how we process your personal information in connection with your use of our service and to enable you to make informed decisions about your personal information when using the Why Toyz Worlds and the Services and the Products.

**2 How we use your information**:

We use information held about you (and information about others that you have provided us with) in the following ways:

**2.1 Contact Information:**

information that identifies you to the Services and/or Why Toyz Worlds and/or Products, such as your user name, email address, delivery address, telephone number, password, and IP address. For example, we use this information to authenticate you when you log in to the Why Toyz Worlds, and use the IP address to brows, print and use the Why Toyz Worlds and the Services.

In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include personal data, to verify your identity and the nature of your request. We will take reasonable steps to respond to all requests within 30 days (or less!).
