2\. What Personal Data do we handle and for what?
-------------------------------------------------

Pipefy uses information it collects to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose services or technical issues, maintain security, customize content, retrieve information to help you access your account efficiently, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track content and users to provide better service.

  
Pipefy undertakes to process information legally classified as Personal Data in compliance with applicable legislation, including, but not limited to, Federal Law 13.709/2018 (Brazil’s General Data Protection Law) and, as Personal Data Processing Operator, will carry out the Processing of Personal Data solely to achieve the Purposes delimited by the Terms of Use and/or other documents that regulate the relationship between Pipefy and its customers.

  
When in the position of Operator, Pipefy has the right to refuse, upon formal and written notification, any operation ordered by a Controller, which implies the Processing of Personal Data in non-compliance with the rules for the protection of Personal Data in force.  
  

Pipefy declares itself as data controller only of the personal data used to create the platform users, for example: the customer's name and email, where the legal basis defined for such control is the contract execution, in order to access the platform to use our product.

  
For all other data entered, registered, stored, and processed on the platform, Pipefy declares itself as data operator, providing only the platform for our customers to operationalize this data.

**Information provided directly by yourself:**

**• Registration:** You provide us with information about yourself, such as your name and email address, when you register for an account to use our Service, including connecting to our Service through a Third Party service, or "following", "becoming a fan," downloading Pipefy app etc. on a Third Party website or network. Your name, email address, and other information, which you choose to provide on the Service, will be visible to and discovered by other users in accordance with your settings on our Service.

We may use your email address to send messages related to the Service (including any notices required by law, instead of postal mail communication). We may also use your contact information to send email marketing. If you don’t want to receive further messages from us, you can choose to unsubscribe to them by following the proper instructions disclosed in each message. 

  
If you communicate with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages and your email address, as well as our responses. If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to sign up to the Service, we will ask for that person's email address and will automatically send an email invitation. Pipefy stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service.

**  
• Content**: You also provide us non-personal information in Content you post to the Service. Your Content and metadata about your Content may be viewed by other users in accordance with your settings on the Service. Pipefy can, but has no obligation, to monitor your Content you post on the Service. We may also remove any information you post in accordance with the provisions of the Terms and Conditions. Pipefy or Pipefy’s employees will not review your Content, except for the following: (i) if your settings on the Service allow it; (ii) to maintain, provide or improve the Service; (iii) to help you resolve your support requests; or (iv) to comply with or avoid any violation of applicable law or regulation by cooperating with law enforcement.

**Data automatically collected** 

**• Cookies:** When you use the Service, we may send one or more “cookies” — a small data file — to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let Pipefy help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

**  
• Log Files**: When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information sent by your web browser. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, and other such information.

**  
• Clear Gifs Information:** When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make Pipefy better for our users.

**  
• Geo-Location Information:** When you use the Service by or through a mobile device or computer/laptop, we may access, collect, monitor, and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your device. Location data, even though we do not collect or share Personal Data that identifies you immediately, may be used in conjunction with other Personal Data that allows your identification. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if usage or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

**  
• Device Identifiers:** When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device and are used to enhance the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. Pipefy may access, collect, and/or store device identifiers upon enabling Pipefy’s Services.

  
A device identifier may be stored by the following means: in connection with the device hardware, by data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier, while not collecting or sharing any Personal Data that directly identifies you, may be used in conjunction with other Personal Data that allows your identification.

**• Third Party Tools:** Pipefy uses third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand use of the Service. Many of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy.

**  
Your Use:** We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example, if you use a third party application to access your account (see below). You can review and revise your profile information at any time.

  
In Brazil, in the event that Personal Data of individuals under 12 years old is processed, we will request specific and detached consent from a parent or legal guardian. In European Union, if the Personal Data of individuals under 16 years of age is processed, we will request the consent of the person who holds parental power over the child. Finally, in the UK, if the Personal Data Processing of individuals under the age of 13 is incomplete, we will ask for the consent of the person who holds parental power over the child.

3\. Why and with whom do we share your Personal Data?
-----------------------------------------------------

We share your Personal Data only for specific and legitimate Purposes, always in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection legislation, as described below:

**Service providers and others:** Pipefy may share your Personal Data with other Third Parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do, such business partners and other Third Parties will be required to keep your information confidential and adopt the same procedures and level of protection that Pipefy does. We may also store Personal Data in locations outside Pipefy's premises (for example, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

**Business Transfers:**  As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customers, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

**Third-Party Services:** We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. So you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.

**Anonymized Data**: We may disclose some information, normally aggregated, with Third Party interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Pipefy Services.
