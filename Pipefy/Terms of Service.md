Customers can utilize the Pipefy Solution themselves or through the hiring of additional services, governed by specific terms. This Agreement governs the access and use of the Pipefy Solution by Users. 

**1.2** Subject to Customer's compliance with the terms of this Agreement and payment of the fees prescribed herein,  Pipefy hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive and non-transferable subscription license (“License”) entitling Customer to access and use the Pipefy Solution identified and described in either the Virtual Account (defined below) or a Purchase Order (the “Effective Date”).

**1.3** Customers may utilize the Pipefy Solution by acquiring a License for each authorized users (the "User"), according to the different plans available at https://www.pipefy.com/pricing/. Customers and/or Users can commence utilizing the Pipefy Solution upon registering and creating an account (the "Virtual Account") on the Pipefy Website and/or formalizing a Purchase Order, whichever occurs first. The right to access the Pipefy Solution shall remain effective throughout the Contract Term.

1. 1.3.1 Administrator User. The Customer bears sole responsibility for identifying each added User, and may, when necessary, transfer or modify these identifications and usage permissions.

* a) If the limit defined in the Pipefy Single Tenant Options, as described in the table above, is exceeded, it is suggested to upgrade to a higher Tenant plan to support the usage. Both parties shall mutually discuss and come to an agreement to determine the next steps.

b) The provider shall notify the Customer when such a limit occurs, along with the necessary usage details to support the suggestion. In any case, any additional costs resulting from such excessive usage shall be paid by the Customer.  
  
**2\. Preparation Environment**

* a) All Single Tenant plans include an intermediate organization where API call volumes and automation job counts will be excluded from billing calculations.

b) Workato does not include a staging environment, and usage for testing cannot be excluded from billing calculations as there is no efficient way to separate it.  
  
**3\. Resilience**

* a) The Pipefy architecture is highly available and leverages fault-tolerant architecture across up to 3 availability zones in a region.

* b) Pipefy can be configured in any region of the Customer’s choice within the Pipefy Cloud subprocessor.

* c) Backups are stored in the same region.

* d) Full backups (“Code”) of the database are performed once every 24 hours.

* e) Each backup is retained for up to 7 days in the same Customer’s choice within the Pipefy Cloud subprocessor region.

* f) Code (full backup): Every 6 hours, retaining a maximum of 12 snapshots.

* g) Logs: Retained for 5 years. These logs cannot be restored. The Customer can open a ticket with Pipefy, which can assist in providing audit log details of these backups.

* h) Any changes on the web (such as field deletion) can be safely restored via support ticket for a period of up to 180 days.

* i) Pipefy maintains backups utilizing Amazon Aurora across at least 3 AZs, which can help Pipefy revert to a previous state.  
      
    

**4\. Business Continuity**
