The Customer accepts and agrees to the terms of these Terms by (i) clicking on a box indicating acceptance, (ii) executing a Purchase Order referencing these Terms, or (iii) using the Pipefy Solution, even if on a free or trial basis.

BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, THE CUSTOMER REPRESENTS THAT THEY HAVE FULL POWER TO CONTRACT AND TO BIND THE LEGAL ENTITY OR ENTITY THEY REPRESENT, OBLIGING IT TO COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE OR DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY TO BIND THE COMPANY OR ENTITY, DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OR ACCESS/USE THE PIPEFY SOLUTION OR ITS SITES.

**1\. PIPEFY SOLUTION**

1.1. The Pipefy Platform (also referred to as the "Pipefy Solution") is a cloud-based tool that enables the registered Legal Entity on the Pipefy website ("Customer") to automate and manage different types of processes through the use of existing templates or configurations of the Pipefy Solution. Users can utilize the Pipefy Solution or hire additional services, governed by specific terms. These Terms govern access to and use of the Pipefy Solution by Users and their authorized representatives.

1.2. Subject to Customer's compliance with these Terms and payment of the fees prescribed herein, Pipefy hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive and non-transferable subscription license ("License"), entitling Customer to access and use the Pipefy Solution identified and described in either the Virtual Account (defined below) or a Purchase Order.

The right to access the Pipefy Solution shall remain effective throughout the Agreement Term.

1.3.1. **Specific Functionalities per Plan.** Pipefy reserves the right to offer different or specific functionalities and features for each plan. The essential features of each plan will be as described on the pricing page (https://www.pipefy.com/pricing/) in effect at the time the Customer contracts or renews the service. Additional features not listed on the pricing page may be modified, added, or removed at Pipefy's discretion.

Usage Limits and Additional Charges.** Use of the Pipefy solution will be subject, depending on the plan chosen, to limits on the number of processes, users, cards, guests, interfaces, database records, storage, automation tasks, API calls, customizable integrations, connections between processes, among others provided for in the link above. In the event of exceeding these limits, the Customer will be subject to charges for excess usage, additional packages and/or migration to a higher plan, as regulated by the other conditions of these Terms.

1.3.2.1. **Additional Packages.** Depending on availability, the Customer may purchase, by signing a Purchase Order, additional packages to extend the limits of the Pipefy Solution Plan, as well as certain Add-Ons, if purchased. For detailed information on package prices and conditions, the Customer should contact their Account Manager or Pipefy Support. The deductible for these packages is not cumulative and is renewed monthly according to the Agreement Term and payment cycle.

1.4. **Administrator User ("Admin") and Account Administrator ("Super Admin").** The Customer bears sole responsibility for identifying each added User, and may, when necessary, transfer or modify these identifications and usage permissions. The Virtual Account shall be managed by at least one User with privileges designated as "Admin" or "Super Admin," as authorized by the Customer.

1.4.1. **Admin**. It holds, among other things, the capability to add new Licenses and Functionalities under conditions equivalent to those existing, as well as to create, monitor, or modify permissions of other Users, manage access, control, remove, or alter the Customer's data in whole or in part.

1.4.2. **Super Admin**. It holds all the privileges of the Admin, as well as the exclusive ability to create custom functions, manage service accounts and even edit the functions and permissions of the Customer's users within the Virtual Account dashboard.

1.4.3. Upon creating a User identification, the Customer shall be responsible for: (a) maintaining the security and confidentiality of passwords and accesses of its Users, such passwords being non-transferable and non-sharable; (b) any and all action performed using the accounts of its Users, in particular those of the Admin and Super Admin; (c) ensuring that all Users are over sixteen (16) years old and are properly instructed to use the Pipefy Solution; and (d) immediately notifying Pipefy upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use or access to its Virtual Account and/or any violation of these Terms.

1.6. **Minimum Franchise and Excess Usage.** In all cases, the initial number of Licenses, Services, Add-Ons, and Functionalities contracted, specified in the Virtual Account and/or in the Purchase Order, must be maintained constant during the agreed term and will serve as the baseline amount that the Customer will be billed regardless of the actual usage (the "Minimum Franchise"). Pipefy is authorized to charge any excess over the License, Service, Add-Ons, and Functionality Franchises, and adjust the level of usage and for future charges, according to the new level used,Â regardless of approval, by sending prior notice at least 30 days before the start of the charge. Continued excess usage will constitute acceptance of the new charging conditions.

1.6.1. **Accounting and Billing for Automation.** Automation jobs shall be charged monthly based on triggers, regardless of whether the action has been carried out. In other words, each time a trigger is activated, even if the action is not executed due to conditionals, the trigger will be counted. Detailed information on accounting for automation is available in the Pipefy Community ("Manual"), accessible via: [https://community.pipefy.com/.](https://community.pipefy.com/) The Customer agrees that the use of the Pipefy Solution implies acceptance of these accounting conditions and usage limits.

Each HTTP request, including but not limited to data creation, read, update and delete operations, will be considered an API call. The accounting will include successful calls, in whole or in part, as well as the conditionals applied in the calls that directly influence the API's processing, and response. Detailed information on accounting for API calls is available in the Manual. The Customer agrees that the use of the Pipefy Solution implies acceptance of these accounting conditions and usage limits.

**11.3. Effects of Termination.** In any case of expiration or termination of these Terms, the Parties shall cease using and destroy all Confidential Information any Party has received under this Agreement, confirming such destruction to the Disclosing Party as requested by the other Party.

**12\. Â LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

12.1. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY NOR THEIR SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR any consequential, incidental, special, indirect, or exemplary damages related to or resulting from the use or inability to use the Pipefy Solution, products, services, or information, or from the provision or failure to provide support services. This includes, but is not limited to, lost profits, loss of data, business interruption, personal injury, failure to fulfill any duty, or any other financial or non-financial loss. These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of any limited remedy. IN ALL CASES, INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES, THE LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES AND THEIR SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT EFFECTIVELY PAID BY THE CUSTOMER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE CONTRACTED PRICES REFLECT THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REGULATED HEREIN.

12.2. Except as otherwise provided below, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including, but not limited to, loss of profits, revenue, data, or use, whether in an action in contract, tort or otherwise, even if the other Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section shall not apply to damages arising from (a) intentional misconduct or gross negligence; (b) willful misconduct; (c) infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by either Party; or (d) any payment obligations specified in Section 3.

Pipefy will indemnify the Customer for claims related to the infringement of third parties' intellectual property rights in the Pipefy Solution, provided that the Pipefy Solution is used under these Terms, except in cases where the Pipefy Solution is modified by the Customer, used in conjunction with non-Pipefy Applications, or involves infringements related to Customer Data and/or external events that lead to indemnification obligations for the Customer. Conversely, the Customer will indemnify Pipefy for any violations of these Terms or applicable law, infringement of third-party rights concerning Customer Data, as well as claims related solely to the operations of the Customer and its end users, independent of the Pipefy Solution**.**Â 

13.2. For indemnification obligations under this Section to be applicable, the Non-breaching Party seeking indemnification must: (i) promptly provide written notice of the claim for which indemnification is sought, (ii) allow the Breaching Party to control the defense and/or settlement of the claim, provided that the Breaching Party does not enter into any monetary obligation or admission of liability without the prior explicit consent of the Non-breaching Party, and (iii) reasonably assist in the defense or settlement at the request and expense of the Breaching Party.

14.3.1. In the event of refunds, Pipefy will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller, who in turn will be solely responsible for refunding any amounts to the Customer.

1\. The purpose of this CCPA Data Protection Agreement (âCCPA DPAâ) is to define the conditions in which Pipefy, Inc. (âPipefyâ or the âProcessorâ) undertakes to carry out, on Customerâs (âCustomerâ or the âControllerâ) behalf, the personal data processing operations defined below.

2\. As part of their contractual relations, the parties shall undertake to comply with the applicable regulations on personal data processing and, in particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter âthe General Data Protection Regulationâ, or âGDPRâ), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (Cal. Civ. Code Â§Â§ 1798.100 to 1798.199), and any related regulations or guidance provided by the California Attorney General (hereinafter âthe CCPAâ).

3\. Terms defined in the CCPA, including âconsumerâ, âpersonal informationâ, âservice providerâ, âcommercial purposesâ, âthird-partyâ, and âbusiness purposesâ, carry the same meaning in this DPA.

4\. âContracted Business Purposesâ means the database management, hosting and related services performed on behalf of the Customer pursuant to the Service Agreement for which Pipefy receives or accesses Customer Personal Information.

5\. âCustomer Personal Informationâ means Customer Data (as defined in the Service Agreement and Privacy Policy) that constitutes personal information of a consumer subject to the CCPA. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer Personal Information does not include User Personal Information (as defined in the Privacy Policy), with respect to which Pipefy is not a service provider, and this DPA does not apply to such User Personal Information.

(a) Pipefy shall use the Customer Personal Information received under this relationship solely for the purposes agreed upon between the Parties. Under no circumstances shall Pipefy use this Personal Data for any other purpose than performing the Contracted Business Purposes or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA (as a service provider or âexemptâ third party) or required by law. Any violation of this provision shall result in the immediate termination of this Agreement and full liability for any damages caused to the other Party and/or third parties.

(b) Pipefy shall not retain, use, disclose, store or share Customer Personal Information outside of this direct business relationship between Pipefy and Customer unless otherwise permitted by the CCPA (as a service provider or âexemptâ third party) or as required by law, or, upon the prior express authorization of the Customer, in accordance with the terms of this DPA.

(c) Pipefy shall adopt appropriate mechanisms for processing Customer Personal Information in accordance with legal provisions, to prevent loss, destruction, theft, damage, alteration, sale, manipulation, or accidental interception and/or disclosure.

(d) Pipefy may use aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized data for its own purposes. Pipefy shall not attempt to, nor will it actually, re-identify any data that has been aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized. For the avoidance of doubt, and to the extent permitted by the CCPA, Pipefy may use Customer Personal Information to detect data security incidents, prevent fraudulent or illegal activity, or enhance its services.

(e) both parties shall comply with all applicable requirements of the CCPA regarding the collection, use, retention, or disclosure of Customer Personal Information. In the event that any request is made by end users of the Customer, the Customer will be responsible for providing customer service. Pipefy does not control or manage the Customer Personal Information.

6\. Sub-Processing. Pipefy may engage specialized third parties to provide the Contracted Business Services, as listed at www.pipefy.com/sub-processors/ (âSub-Processorsâ). Pipefy is responsible for ensuring that its Sub-Processors agree to maintain a level of security that is equal to or exceeds the standards described in this DPA before any Personal Data is transferred or sub-processing is authorized. Any sub-processor must qualify as a service provider under the CCPA, and Pipefy shall ensure that no disclosures to the sub-processor are made that would be considered a sale under the CCPA. Pipefy shall also conduct periodic audits to verify that its Sub-Processors comply with applicable privacy rules and legal obligations. Pipefy shall be fully and jointly liable for any breach, violation, irregularity, or non-compliance committed by its Sub-Processors.

7\. If the Customer is unable to delete Customer Personal Information held within Pipefyâs records in response to a verified Consumer request for deletion pursuant to the CCPA. Pipefy shall promptly effectuate such deletion upon receipt of the Customerâs written instruction to do so, provided that no exception to deletion under the CCPA is applicable and/or Pipefy is not legally restricted from doing so. Pipefy may charge its then-current standard fees for this service. Requests for deletion should be submitted to: [https://app.pipefy.com/public/form/CxbZakYy](https://app.pipefy.com/public/form/CxbZakYy).

(a) To reflect a change in the name or form of a legal entity;

(b) To comply with the applicable law, regulation, court order, or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency; or

(c) If the change does not expand the scope of Pipefyâs processing of Customer Personal Data, or otherwise materially adversely affect Customerâs rights under this DPA.

(d) Pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) or (iii), notify the Customer at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change (or such shorter period as may be required to comply with the applicable law), provided that, if the Customer object to any such changes, the Customer may terminate the Agreement with Pipefy by providing a written notice to Pipefy within 90 days of receiving notification of the change.

This document aims to ensure that the quality and efficiency of the services provided meet the agreed standards, promoting transparency and alignment between the Parties. The provisions described herein complement the Terms of Use and apply to all Pipefy Customers, depending on the applicable Plan.

1\. **General Availability:** Pipefy guarantees **99.90% ("Guaranteed Percentage")** uptime of the Pipefy Solution per month. For the purposes of calculating unavailability that can be credited under the clause below, only unavailability classified as "Major Outage" on the Status Page: [https://status.pipefy.com/uptime](https://status.pipefy.com/uptime) will be counted, i.e. when a significant part or all of the Pipefy Solution is inaccessible and/or inoperative, affecting most or all of the Customers.

2\. If the Monthly Availability Percentage is lower than the Guaranteed Percentage, the Customer may claim a non-cumulative credit or discount, which will be applied to the next invoice or the renewal of its Plan, without the possibility of converting it into cash. In order to do so, Pipefy must be notified within thirty (30) days of the event via the Support chat, including evidence of the unavailability and other information requested by Pipefy. Pipefy will calculate the amount of the applicable credit or discount, according to the percentage shown in the table below and, in all cases, limited to 10% of the total value of the current Agreement Term:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Monthly Availability Percentage** | **Credit Percentage** |
| Less than 99.9%, but greater than or equal to 98% | 5%  |
| Less than 98%, but greater than or equal to 95% | 10% |
| Less than 95%, but greater than or equal to 90% | 15% |
| Less than 90%, but greater than or equal to 85% | 20% |
| Less than 85% | 30% |

2.1. The aforementioned Status Page will, for all purposes, be the official reference for calculating the monthly percentage of activity time and calculating any credits or discounts due.

2.2. The following shall not be considered unavailable: (i) periods of suspension or inactivity scheduled for hardware replacement, maintenance, or updates of the Pipefy Solution, as described in the Terms of Use; (ii) periods of inactivity and/or instability resulting from circumstances beyond Pipefy's reasonable control, such as fortuitous events or force majeure, as defined by law, actions of third parties and/or the Customer itself, among others. The planned unavailability provided for in these Terms shall not be counted.

**3\. Support Activities:** The Pipefy support team will make every effort to assist the Customer according to the response times outlined in the table below. The countdown of the deadline shall commence from the moment the event is communicated through the channel specified in item 10 below.Â

**ANNEX IV - PIPEFY AI TERMS OF USE**

This Annex IV regulates the access and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) resources within the Pipefy Solution (Pipefy AI), effective from the date of first use of such resources by the Customer. If any of the Pipefy AI features are offered as a beta service, the Customer acknowledges that the use of these features is subject to limitations and potential instabilities typical of new technology. This Annex is part of the Purchase Order along with the Terms and Conditions of the Pipefy Solution (collectively, the âTermsâ) and governs the rights and obligations of the Customer in using certain optional features of the Pipefy Solution involving the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies provided by Pipefy and/or its licensors (âPipefy AIâ). Capitalized terms not defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Terms.Â  This Annex IV is an integral and inseparable part of the Terms and Conditions of the Pipefy Solution (the âTermsâ or âAgreementâ). All provisions of the Agreement not expressly modified by this Annex IV shall remain in full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Annex IV and the Agreement, the provisions of this Annex IV will prevail solely for the use of Pipefy AI. For all other matters, the Agreement will continue to govern the relationship between the Parties. The Parties agree on the following:

**1\. Pipefy AI Features.** Pipefy may provide features and capabilities of the Pipefy Solution that use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (âPipefy AIâ). These features may be developed by Pipefy and/or by Pipefyâs third-party providers, per Pipefyâs Privacy Policy. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that Pipefy may use subprocessors to provide Pipefy AI features. Pipefy and its subprocessors exclusively own all rights, titles, and interests in Pipefy AI, including all associated intellectual property rights. Pipefy and its subprocessors exclusively own all rights, titles, and interests in Pipefy AI, including all associated intellectual property rights. The Customer is granted only a limited, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use Pipefy AI under these terms. The Customer acknowledges that, due to the nature of machine learning, other customers may generate identical or similar Outputs. The use of these outputs is the Customerâs sole responsibility.

**2\. Personal Data** (as defined in Annex I). By inputting personal data and other Customer Data into Pipefy AI, the Customer authorizes Pipefy and its third-party providers to process this Personal Data to provide the Pipefy AI features and generate âOutputs.â The Customer retains ownership of the data entered (âInputâ) and the results generated (âOutputâ), collectively referred to as âContent.â By using Pipefy AI, the Customer grants Pipefy and its third-party providers the necessary rights to process data, including personal data, for the purpose of delivering Pipefy AI features.

**3\. Data Security, Monitoring, and Processing.** Customer data is shared and processed in real-time only for the specific request and is not retained after processing. This approach aims to prevent any permanent learning mechanisms, ensuring that Customer data is not stored or distributed while maintaining confidentiality and security. Only information under Customer control can be used for a request in Pipefy AI. The Customer is responsible for determining which data will be made available in Pipefy AI, ensuring that Pipefy AI cannot access confidential data outside this context, thus ensuring the security and privacy of information. Pipefy also undertakes not to use Customer data for training its AI models, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties. Additionally, Pipefy reserves the right to monitor the use of Pipefy AI to prevent, detect, and correct abusive, illegal, or unauthorized usage, as well as to address technical issues.

**4\. AI** **Results.** The Customer may choose to provide information, data, and other content for processing by Pipefy AI (âInputâ) and receive results based on the Input (âOutputâ), collectively referred to as âAI Results.â By using Pipefy AI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Customer retains ownership of AI Results generated with its specific data and is solely responsible for them, including compliance with relevant laws and Agreement terms, except for Outputs related to suggestions that may be identical or similar to those provided to other Customers and will not be owned by the Customer. Inputs and Outputs are collectively referred to as âContent.â

**5\. Customer Use and Responsibilities**. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that any use of Pipefy AI, including providing or making available an Input and using the Output, complies with applicable law and does not infringe third-party rights, including intellectual property and privacy rights. The Customer is solely responsible for the content generated through Pipefy AI and for any decisions based on these Outputs.

**6\. Content Use and AI Improvements.** Pipefy (i) does not claim any ownership of Customer Content; (ii) will use Content as necessary to provide, improve, and maintain AI Features and the Pipefy Solution, including transmitting Input and receiving Suggestions from its service providers, if applicable, complying with the law, and enforcing its security policies; and (iii) will not be responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of the Suggestions. AI and machine learning models may improve over time to better serve specific use cases. Pipefy may compile statistical, technical, and usability data from Pipefy AI, as well as use Feedback voluntarily provided by the Customer to enhance the Solution, as regulated by the Agreement.

7\. **Warranties.** Although Pipefy uses advanced techniques to ensure that AI responses are as accurate as possible, it is important to recognize that AI is constantly evolving and may present errors or inconsistencies. As such, Pipefy does not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose of the results generated by AI functionalities. Pipefy AI is provided âas isâ and âas available,â and the use of Outputs is at the Customerâs own risk. Pipefy does not warrant that Pipefy AI will be error-free, uninterrupted, or suitable for any specific purpose. The Customer bears full responsibility for the information entered and obtained through Pipefy AI, and such information should not be considered as the sole source of truth or supersede review by a qualified professional. The Customer should not rely on statements, output designs, workflow/processes, or output codes without independently verifying their accuracy and suitability for specific needs. No information, suggestion, or Result generated by AI will constitute any warranty not explicitly stated in this Annex.Â 

**8\. Restrictions.** The Customer may not use the Pipefy AI functionalities or Output information to: (a) develop base models or other large-scale models that compete with Pipefy AI; (b) deceive third parties into believing that the Output was generated exclusively by humans; (c) violate any technical documentation, usage guidelines, or established parameters; (d) make automated decisions that may negatively impact individual rights without appropriate human oversight; and/or (e) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any rights of Pipefy or third parties; (f) generate offensive, discriminatory, or illegal content; and (g) engage in illegal or fraudulent activities.Â 

Additionally, the Customer: (h) will not use Pipefy AI and Content in violation of the Agreement and this Annex IV, third-party rights, any applicable laws, or other requirements provided by Pipefy; (i) is solely responsible for the development, operation, maintenance, and use of the Content; (j) agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Pipefy harmless from all third-party claims arising from the Customerâs use of Pipefy AI in violation of the Agreement, this Annex IV, or where any Input, Output, or Result generated by the Customer using Pipefy AI infringes or misappropriates third-party intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, or any applicable laws; (k) instructs Pipefy to process Content in accordance with this Annex IV, including processing Content with its Subprocessors or Pipefy providers related to Pipefy AI; (l) acknowledges and agrees that if using any non-Pipefy Application to process Content, it is solely responsible for complying with the applicable terms and conditions and privacy policy of such non-Pipefy Applications and for its use of such Non-Pipefy Applications; and (m) acknowledges and agrees that Pipefy AI is not operated by a human and the Output is not generated by humans.Â 

**9\. Pricing and Availability.** Access to Pipefy AI is managed through a credit system (âAI Creditsâ). Each Plan in the Pipefy Solution will include an initial allocation of AI Credits, and additional credits may be purchased separately, as needed and/or as agreed between the Parties in the Purchase Order, through contracting with Pipefy. The number of credits available will vary according to the Plan purchased and as detailed on the Pipefy pricing page, as indicated in Section 1 of the Agreement.

9.1. AI Credits will be renewed monthly, according to the term of the contracted Plan, and are non-cumulative. Unused credits until the end of each month will not be refunded. The Super Admin(s) may monitor credit usage through the Pipefy Solutionâs Admin Dashboard.

**10\. Updates and Modifications.** Pipefy may update this Annex or the Pipefy AI services periodically due to, among other reasons, changes in legislation or regulatory requirements, security or protection reasons, circumstances beyond Pipefyâs reasonable control, changes resulting from the ongoing development of the Services, and/or to adapt to new technologies. The Customer will be informed of any changes to these Terms that may negatively impact the use of the services with at least 30 daysâ notice, via email or product notification. All other changes will take effect as soon as they are posted on our website. If the Customer does not agree with the changes, they must cease using Pipefy AI after their credits expire.

**11\. Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances will Pipefy or its third-party providers be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, use, reputation, or other intangible losses resulting from the use or inability to use AI functionalities.

**12\. Term and Termination.** The Customer may access and use Pipefy AI while complying with the terms of this Annex. Pipefy may modify, discontinue, or cancel access to Pipefy AI, in whole or in part, under the provisions of the Agreement. In the event of termination, for any reason, the Customer must immediately cease using Pipefy AI and will no longer have access to Pipefy AI features.
