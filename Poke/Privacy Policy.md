START OF PRIVACY POLICY

### We Dont Collect Information that can indentify you

  
([see source](https://codeberg.org/ashley/poke/src/branch/main/css/data-mobile.js))  
  
We use Matomo (https://matomo.org/) to gather and store non-identifying information for statistical purposes. The data collected includes details such as your country (inferred from anonymized IP addresses like 111.xx.xxx.xx), operating system, browser version and name, and screen size. This information helps us understand and improve our services.  
  
The above doesn't apply if you have Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control enabled on the browser level.

### We dont see the videos you watch

  
When the Video gets sent to the matomo server, we encrypt it using SHA-256 Signature Algorithm; ([See source](https://codeberg.org/ashley/poke/src/branch/main/css/data-mobile.js#L19-L23)) meaning we cant see the videos you watching or things you do. Learn more [About hash Algorithms here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms)  
  
We migth use third party services on Poke, but third party request on Poke is proxied by default. no third party can see wat the hell ru doing on PokeTube. We do this by proxying the requests via a whole diffrent server, so no third party can see you.

### We don’t track you through cookies

  
on Poke, no cookies are used by default. ([see source](https://codeberg.org/ashley/poke/src/branch/main/css/data-mobile.js#L79)) Poke Doesnt use cookies (See the storage tab yourself!). altho we use local storage to save stuff like themes.

### Other Free YouTube Front-Ends  

If you care about privacy and your freedom, you might also want to check out these other YouTube Front-ends that take it seriously by default
