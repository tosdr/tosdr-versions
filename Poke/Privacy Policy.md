START OF PRIVACY POLICY

### We dont collect your personal information

  
we dont collect your personal information or share it. We dont collect your IP address. Your device metadata (e.g. device resolution, OS etc.) is not collected in anyway.  

### We dont see the videos you watch

  
Our servers are secured with SHA-384 Signature Algorithm; meaning we cant see the videos you watching, things you search, or things you do. Learn more [About hash Algorithms here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms)  
  
We migth use third party services on PokeTube, but third party request on PokeTube is proxied by default. no third party can see wat the hell ru doing on PokeTube. We do this by proxying the requests via a whole diffrent server, so no third party can see you.  

### We dont see the videos you watch

  
When you watch a video at PokeTube, we don't know who you are and there is no way to tie the things you are watching. When you access a website, your Web browser automatically sends information about your computer. (e.g. your User agent and IP address.)  
  
Because this information could be used to link you to your peronsal information, we do not log (store) it at all. This is a very unusual practice, but we feel it is an important step to protect your privacy. It is unusual for a reason. most server software auto-stores this information, so you have to go out of your way not to store it.  

### We don’t track you through cookies

  
on PokeTube, no cookies are used by default. PokeTube Doesnt use cookies (See the storage tab yourself!). altho we use local storage to save stuff like themes.  

### We only collect your email if you want us to

  
if you Subscribe to updates on [PokeTube status site](https://status.poketube.fun/), we may be store your email to send you email notifications whenever we create, update or resolve an incident. you can also use a alias adress such as [Private Duck Address](https://duckduckgo.com/email/) to keep your email identity hidden  

### We improve poketube by using anonymous methods

  
We use a tool called Piwik (A free software Web analytics system, see piwik.org) to collect information. By information we mean, aggregated data about things such as the number of visits daily/weekly/monthly to PokeTube.  
  
This data can't be used to identify you or your device or to learn anything about you individually. This Information thats being collected is anonymous and only analyzed in aggregate. It will never identify you or your machine.  
  
This Process does not use cookies in any way. If you want to opt out (for some reason, we still dont know why lol), Click the "Opt out Of Metrics" Button on the bottom rigth side of the player. No data that identifies you or that can be linked to you as an individual is collected on poketube.

We Also save searches, but again, not in a personally identifiable way, as we do not store IP addresses or unique User agent strings. We use aggregate, non-personal search data.  

### We proxy 3rd party request

any 3rd party domain is proxied by our proxy (p.poketube.fun) No personal Information is collected by the tools we use.

### Liability

We take no responsibility for the use of our tool, or external instances provided by third parties. We strongly recommend you abide by the valid official regulations in your country. Furthermore, we refuse liability for any inappropriate use of PokeTube, such as illegal downloading. This tool is provided to you in the spirit of free, libre software.

You may view the GPL V3 licence which this software is provided to you [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). a copy of the section is bellow.

> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
