_Sharing your Personal Information_

Hughes shares your personal information as described in Section 3 above.  In the preceding twelve (12) months, Hughes has disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose with Service Providers or Credit Reporting Agencies**:  CATEGORIES A, B, and D.**

_Sales of your Personal Information_

**Hughes does not sell your personal information to third parties and has no plans to do so in the future.**

**_How to Exercise Your California Privacy Rights_**

To exercise your California privacy rights, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

* Calling us at 866-569-5152
* Emailing us at privacy@hughes.com

Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Hughes cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

Hughes will only use personal information provided in a request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

Hughes strives to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

Non-affiliated third parties are independent from Hughes and if you wish to receive information about your disclosure choices or stop communications from such third parties, you will need to contact those non-affiliated third parties directly.

**6\. How we protect information**

Hughes has taken certain physical, administrative, and technical steps to safeguard the personal information we collect from and about our Website visitors. While we make every effort to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee our security measures.

**7. Children**

This Website is not directed toward children under 13 years of age, nor does Hughes knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not submit any personal information to Hughes.

**8.** **Links**

The Website may have links to third-party websites, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own.  We are not responsible for the practices of such sites.

The Website may also offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites, which may allow us and/or the social media site to receive data from or about you. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin, such as a Twitter Follow button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personal information to a third-party operating a plug-in on this Website, then such third-party may recognize you on this Website. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from ours, so please read these policies carefully to understand their policies and your options. As with linked sites, we have no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social network plugins, and are not responsible for the practices of such sites.
