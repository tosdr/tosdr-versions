A number of resources, products, services, communication tools, administrative services, customer account logins, and other information may be accessed by you through the Websites. The term “you” or “your” includes you, any of your subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, contractors, subcontractors, parents or legal guardians, or any other entity or individual that accesses the Website for or on your behalf. 

By accessing or using the Websites in any manner, you agree to comply with these Terms of Use, together with any documents, policies, and guidelines incorporated in these Terms of Use by reference (referred to collectively as the “Terms”). Certain services available through the Websites, especially those for which you are asked to subscribe or pay money, may have their own terms and conditions that apply to your purchase or use of that particular service. These Terms  apply only to your use of the Websites, do not apply to any other Hughes-affiliate websites, to any Hughes product or service, nor do they change any other agreement between you and Hughes. To the extent that there is any conflict between these Terms and any terms and conditions or agreements relating to services you have purchased or online tools you use or to which you subscribe, those conflicting terms set forth in the other terms and conditions or agreements will govern.

**Authority**

The Website is intended for adults only. By using the Websites, you represent that you are at least 13 years old. Persons who are under the age of 18 may only use our Websites with legal parental or guardian consent. Accordingly, you agree that you are least 18 years of age or older or possess legal parental or guardian consent and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, representations, and warranties set forth in the Terms. Otherwise please exit the Websites. 

**Changes to the Terms or Websites**

Hughes reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or change these Terms at any time without notice by posting the modified or changed Terms on the Website. Such Terms will automatically be effective when posted on our Websites. Your continued use of a Website following the posting of any changes to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of those changes. If at any time you do not agree with these Terms, you must immediately stop using the Websites. Hughes reserves the right to change, modify, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website(s) (or any portion thereof), including any and all content contained on such Website(s), at any time without notice. You agree that Hughes shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Website(s) (or any portion thereof).

**Privacy Policy and Notice Regarding Children**

Please see our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.hughesnet.com/PublicWebsitePrivacyPolicy.cfm) regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information collected on the Website. By using the Website, you are consenting to the terms of our Privacy Policy.

**Notice Regarding Children**

Hughes does not intend for the Websites to collect information from anyone under the age of 13. Information published on the Websites is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. For information regarding Hughes' position on child pornography as well as other restrictions related to your use of the Websites, please review Hughes’ [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.hughesnet.com/AcceptableUsePolicy.cfm).

**Registration, Password and Security**

Whenever you provide information on the Websites, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information; and (b) maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is, or if we, in our sole discretion, have reason to suspect that the information is, untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, Hughes may, without notice, suspend or terminate your access to the Website(s) and refuse any and all current or future use of our Websites (or any portion thereof).

If any portion of our Website requires you to register or open an account, you may also be asked to choose a password and a username. Please select a password that would not be obvious to someone trying to guess your password and, as an added precaution, change it regularly. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account identification. You agree to immediately notify Hughes of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. Without limiting any rights which Hughes may otherwise have, Hughes has the right, but not the obligation, to take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable in its sole discretion, to ensure the security of the Websites and user accounts, including, without limitation, terminating your account, changing your password, mandating that you create a new password, or requesting additional information to authorize transactions on your account. Notwithstanding the above, Hughes may rely on the authority of anyone accessing your account or using your password and in no event and under no circumstances shall Hughes be held liable to you for any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of: (i) any action or inaction of Hughes under this provision; (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your account or password; and/or (iii) any unauthorized access to your account or use of your password. You may not, at any time, use anyone else's account without the permission of the account holder.

While there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, Hughes will take reasonable steps to help ensure the safety of your personally identifying information. However, you understand and agree that such steps do not guarantee that the Website(s) is/are invulnerable to all security breaches. Hughes makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation that use of any of our Website(s) is protected from viruses, security threats, or other vulnerabilities.

All information, materials, and other content located on the Website, except noted third-party materials (“Content”), are the property of Hughes or its affiliates, and are protected under United States and international copyright laws and treaty provisions. Some portions of the Website may require you to download software (“Software”) in order that you may access the Websites, the services provided through the Websites and/or the Content. The Software may be the property of Hughes or a supplier, vendor, or licensor of Hughes. The Content and Software are protected by a variety of laws governing the use of copyrights, trademarks, patents, or trade secrets. Subject to the rules and limitations set forth in the Terms, you are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access the Websites, the Content, and the Software for your personal non-commercial use only, except as otherwise permitted by: (a) these Terms; or (b) any contract or agreement between you and Hughes. You must maintain and plainly display all copyright and other proprietary notices in the same form and manner as on the original and otherwise comply with these Terms.

By downloading or using the Software or underlying information or technology, you agree to the foregoing and represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.

A copyright holder may send Hughes a valid notification of claimed copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 by following the steps outlined in the [Hughes Copyright Policy](https://legal.hughesnet.com/copyright-policy) (_available at,_ https://legal.hughesnet.com/copyright-policy) .

In order to protect Hughes and its customers from fraudulent activity, Hughes may implement procedures regarding any online orders including, but not limited to, validating information provided or limiting the amount of equipment and/or services that may be ordered online by a single individual or entity. Hughes reserves the right to further limit quantities or to cancel or reject orders in its sole discretion.

**Product and Service Information** 

Hughes does not warrant that information, graphic depictions, product and service descriptions, or other content of the Websites is accurate, complete, reliable, updated, current, or error-free. Despite our efforts, it is possible that a price for a product or service offered on the Websites may be inaccurate or the product or service description may contain an inaccuracy. In the event Hughes determines, in its sole discretion, that a product or service contains an inaccurate price or description, Hughes reserves the right to take any action it deems reasonable and necessary, in its sole discretion, to rectify the error, including, without limitation, canceling your order, unless prohibited by law. Hughes may make improvements or changes to any Content, information, products, services, or programs described on the Websites at any time without notice.

With respect to any message, data, image, text, photos, graphics, audio, video, or other material you elect to post to such publicly accessible areas of the Websites, while you retain any and all of your lawfully owned rights in such User Content, you grant Hughes a royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display such User Content which you provide (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed and to exercise the same rights with respect to such works. You also permit any user of our Websites to access, display, view, store, distribute, perform, reproduce, and prepare derivative works of, such User Content that you have placed in publicly accessible areas of our Website.

We do not endorse any User Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein.

You agree that Hughes is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Submitted Material. You agree that you shall have no recourse against Hughes for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right in Submitted Material and that the submission of any Submitted Material to Hughes, including the posting of materials to any forum or interactive area on the Websites, irrevocably waives any and all “moral rights” in such materials. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the Submitted Material that you post, that the Submitted Material is accurate and, that use of the Submitted Material you supply does not violate these Terms and will not cause injury to any person or entity.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM HUGHES OR THROUGH OR FROM OUR WEBSITES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.

**Limitation of Liability**

IN NO EVENT SHALL HUGHES, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, REPRESENTATIVES, SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH: (a) THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITES OR THE CONTENT, MATERIALS, SOFTWARE, INFORMATION, OR TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED ON, OR THROUGH, THE WEBSITES; (b) ANY CLAIM ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN THE WEBSITES OR THE CONTENT, MATERIALS, SOFTWARE, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES ON, OR AVAILABLE THROUGH, THE WEBSITES; (c) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY PRODUCTS, DATA, INFORMATION, OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED, MESSAGES RECEIVED, OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO, THROUGH OR FROM THE WEBSITES; (d) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, OR ALTERATION OF, YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (e) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON OUR WEBSITES; (f) THE DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM AN ACT OF FORCE MAJEURE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTS OF GOD, NATURAL DISASTERS, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, WARS, STRIKES, LABOR DISPUTES, RIOTS, SHORTAGES OF LABOR OR MATERIALS, EPIDEMICS OR PANDEMICS, VANDALISM, TERRORISM, NON-PERFORMANCE OF THIRD PARTIES, OR ANY REASONS BEYOND THEIR REASONABLE CONTROL; OR (g) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE WEBSITES, EVEN IF HUGHES OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE WEBSITES AND/OR WEBSITE-RELATED SERVICES IS TO STOP USING THE WEBSITES AND/OR THOSE SERVICES.

APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE.
