In short, **if you do not want to be tracked, you’re not.**

_So, if you’ve enabled Do Not Track on your browser, the following doesn’t apply._

Now if DNT isn’t enabled, we self-host an open-source analytic software which logs anonymised data in a GDPR compliant fashion. The information is completely anonymised and isn’t shared with any third party.

Of course you can still opt out.

Data retention for anonymised data stored:

* raw data is deleted after 180 days

* all aggregated reports are deleted after 2 years.
