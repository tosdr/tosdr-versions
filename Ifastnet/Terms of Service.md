### USE OF COPYRIGHT MATERIAL AND PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT

Sites must not contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material including links or redirects to copyright material hosted on 3rd party websites / resources. The onus is on you the customer to prove that you own the rights to publish material, not for IFastNet to prove that you do not. IFastNet does not allow the propagation or distribution of copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.

### ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE

Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources. These include bandwidth, processor utilization and / or disk space. Please see the 'High Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.

### SCRIPT USAGE TERMS

Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the server as an application server. Using the server to generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present values to ensure the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.

The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a single email based upon user entered information, or update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a IFastNet -hosted domain.

Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources, or other sites on the same server

### USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS

IFastNet offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website and linked to the site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads, or other non-web based content. We will treat all password protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.

On unlimited disk space plans we offer quotaless disk space access, however the disks in servers are not unlimited so you may become limited if a hard drive begins to fill to capacity.

INODE USAGE

In computing, an inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system such as UFS. An inode stores basic information about a regular file, directory, or other file system object.

[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode)

IFastNet reserves the right to limit INODEs usage on premium hosting plans to 380000 on starter premium plan, 840000 on super and ultimate premium plans, and unlimited inodes on Business hosting plans subject to acceptable usage.

### RIGHT TO SUSPEND / TERMINATE HOSTING SERVICES

You acknowledge that IFastNet may or may not pre-screen Content, but that IFastNet and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, IFastNet and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable, or caused network / server overload. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by IFastNet or submitted to IFastNet , including without limitation information in IFastNet Message Boards and in all other parts of the Service.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that IFastNet may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

1. comply with legal process;
    
2. enforce the TOS;
    
3. respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties;
    
4. respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of IFastNet , its users and the public;
    

You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve

1. transmissions over various networks; and
    
2. changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices;
    

You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by IFastNet and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service. Any unauthorized reproduction, publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.

7\. INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON IFASTNET NETWORK

28\. GENERAL INFORMATION
------------------------

### Entire Agreement

The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and IFastNet and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and IFastNet with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other IFastNet services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.

### Choice of Law and Forum

The TOS and the relationship between you and IFastNet shall be governed by the laws of the United Kingdom without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and IFastNet agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Northumberland, United Kingdom.

### Waiver and Severability of Terms

The failure of IFastNet to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.

### No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability

You agree that your IFastNet account is non-transferable and any rights to your IFastNet ID or contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.

### Statute of Limitations.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
