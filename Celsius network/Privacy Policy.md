Information that is anonymous, aggregated, or deidentified is generally not considered Personal Information.

There are instances where we invite or request individuals to provide us with their Personal Information through our Application, website or otherwise (e.g. by email), and we may also collect some information automatically. Through your use of our Services and your interactions with us, you may provide us with Personal Information including:

* **Identifiers and similar information** such as, name, address, date of birth, email address, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, online identifiers, or other similar identifiers;

* **Professional or employment-related information**, including occupation, compensation, employer, and title;
    
* **Inferences drawn from any of the information identified above** to create a profile reflecting your preferences or similar information; and
    

Sources of Personal Information

We collect Personal Information about you directly from you and/or your intermediaries through sources on our website, our Application, when you register or sign-in to the Services via your social network account, including when the following happens:

Cookies and Google Analytics

We may use cookies and other technologies or methods of web and mobile analysis to gather, store, and track certain information related with your access to and activity through the Services, including when you visit our website.

Below, we describe the types of cookies (as defined below) we use, and how you can control our use of cookies.

Types of Cookies We Use

As mentioned above, we will collect certain information about you when you visit our website. We collect such information through the following technologies (collectively, “cookies”):

* Cookies. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website assigns to your device while you are viewing a website. Cookies may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by other companies (“third-party cookies”). Additionally, some cookies may be temporary and erase when you close your browser (“session cookies”), and others may remain for a set duration (“persistent cookies”).
    
* Log Files. Tools that track actions occurring on the site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
    
* Web Beacons. These “tags” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse our website.
    
* Social Media Widgets. These are tools that allow us to provide certain social media features such as links to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These social features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
    

Cookies are very helpful and may be used for various different purposes such as delivering personalised services. These purposes include, among other things, allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enabling automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction between you and the Services quicker, easier and smoother. Our website may use the following types of cookies:

* **Strictly Necessary Cookies**. These cookies are required for the operation of our website, and are essential to enable you to login, navigate around and use the features of a website, or to provide a service requested by you. We do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these cookies.
    
* **Functionality Cookies**. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by using a cookie to store information about the region in which you are currently located, remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customize, and provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect remains anonymous and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
    
* **Performance/Analytics Cookies**. These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors use a website, for example which pages you go to most often, and record difficulties you may experience while using the Website, for example error messages. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve the efficiency of the website. We also use a tool called Google Analytics to collect information about your use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users access the Services, what pages they visit when they do so, etc. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personal Information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our website is restricted by the[Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
    
* **Targeting/Advertising Cookies**. These cookies are used to deliver advertisements tailored to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. For more information about online behavioral advertising cookies and online privacy, please see the guide produced by the internet advertising industry available at [youronlinechoices.com](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

* _Legitimate Interests._ We process Personal Information for our legitimate business interest in managing and promoting our business, provided that our interest is not overridden by your interest. In identifying and relying on this basis for certain processing, we have weighed our legitimate interest as a business against your rights and freedoms and have determined that such processing will not unfairly impact your rights. If you would like further information on how we balanced these interests, you can contact us using the details below. Please note that you have a right to object to the processing of your Personal Information where that processing is carried on for our legitimate interest.

* _Consent._ We may process your Personal Information with your consent, as required by the GDPR. You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

We respect your privacy rights and therefore you may contact us at any time and request:

• _Access._ You have the right to know we collect certain Personal Information about you and to ask us for copies of your Personal Information. Please use the contact details provided at the end of this Policy.

The right to erasure is not absolute, and only applies if we no longer need your Personal Information to carry out the purpose that we collected it for, whilst in compliance with laws applicable to us; you have withdrawn your consent to our use of your Personal Information; you have objected to our use of your Personal Information and your interests outweigh our interests in using it; you believe we have processed your Personal Information unlawfully; or we have a legal obligation to erase your data. Subject to our retention policies, we will consider any request to erase Personal Information for any of the above reasons and endeavour to comply with the request to the extent permitted by law, but we may not always be able to comply with your request. We may be required to retain the Personal Information for certain retention periods in order to comply with legal and regulatory requirements under applicable laws and regulations to which we are subject. If we are unable to comply with your request, we will contact you in writing. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us at: [app@celsius.network](mailto:app@celsius.network).

• _Restrict processing._ You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances, including if you have concerns regarding the accuracy of your Personal Information, where you have made an objection to our use of your personal data; or if you believe we processed your Personal Information unlawfully, but you do not want us to delete it.

• _Data portability._ You have the right to receive a copy of the Personal Information that we collect about you in a way that is accessible and in a machine-readable format where the processing is based on your consent, the performance of a contract with you, or carried out by automated means. You have the right to request that such Personal Information be transmitted directly from us to another data controller, where technically feasible.

• _Withdrawal of consent._ You can withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

We will store your Personal Information only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, including to provide the Services and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies and agreements. Retention periods will be determined taking into account the type of information that is collected and the purpose for which it is collected, bearing in mind the requirements applicable to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused information at the earliest reasonable time. Under applicable regulations, we will keep records containing client Personal Information, account opening documents, communications and anything else as required by applicable laws and regulations.

We may rectify, replenish or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own discretion. If you wish to make a complaint regarding our handling of your Personal Information, you can contact us at [info@celsius.network](mailto:info@celsius.network). You may also make a complaint to the relevant supervisory authority for data protection issues. In the UK this is the Information Commissioner’s Office (“**ICO**”).

(III) Transfer of Information Outside the UK and/or the EEA

Please note that some data recipients may be located outside the EEA and/or the UK.

* to persons and undertakings outside of the EU or the UK pursuant to other appropriate safeguards for the transfer of Personal Information; and
    
* only on one of the conditions allowed under the GDPR in the absence of (i) a decision by the European Commission or the equivalent entity in the UK that has deemed a country to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information (i.e. an adequacy decision) or (ii) appropriate safeguards such as a contract that is compliant with the model contracts for the transfer of Personal Information to third countries approved by the European Commission or the equivalent entity in the UK.

We may share your personal information with our service providers, other entities that have agreed to limitations on the use of your personal information, or entities that fit within other exemptions or exceptions in or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.

California Resident’s Rights Under the CCPA

If your personal information is subject to the CCPA, you may have certain rights with regard to such personal information, including the right to:

* **Notice at Collection.** Be informed, at or before the point of collection, of the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information shall be used.
    
* **Request to Delete.** Request that we delete any personal information about you that we have collected or maintained, subject to certain exceptions. For example, we may be required to retain the personal information for certain retention periods in order to comply with legal and regulatory requirements under applicable laws and regulations to which we are subject. If you wish to exercise this right, please contact us at: [app@celsius.network](mailto:app@celsius.network).
    
* **Request to Know.** Request that we provide you with: (i) the categories of personal information we have collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information; (iii) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information; (v) the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you; and (vi) the categories of personal information about you we have disclosed for a business purpose.
    
* **Not to Be Discriminated Against.** Not be discriminated against because you exercised any of your rights under the CCPA.
    
* **Opt-Out of Sale.** Request that we not sell your personal information if a business sells your personal information (we do not).
    

The CCPA does not restrict our ability to do certain things like comply with other laws or comply with regulatory investigations. We also reserve the right to retain, and not to delete, certain personal information after receipt of a Request to Delete from you where permitted or required by the CCPA or another law or regulation.

How to Submit a CCPA Rights Request

You can submit a Request to Know or Request to Delete, as described above, by calling 800-654-9386, through our website [www.celsius.network](https://celsius.network/), or via email to [info@celsius.network](mailto:info@celsius.network). When you submit a Request to Know, Request to Delete, or Request to Opt-Out, we may ask that you provide clarifying or identifying information to verify your request. Such information may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, your name, email address and a copy of government issued identification. Any information gathered as part of the verification for a Request to Know, Request to Delete, or Request to Opt-Out will be used for verification or opt-out purposes only.

If you would like to use an authorized agent to submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete, we may request proof that they are authorized to act on your behalf, or have a power of attorney. We may also require that you directly verify your own identity with us and directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

We will deliver responses to verifiable consumer requests, free of charge by mail or electronically, at your election.

We will try to respond to your Requests to Know or to Delete within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the request. If we require more time, we will try to inform you of our need for an extension. Even with an extension, we will try to provide a response within ninety (90) days of initial receipt of the request.

Keep in mind that we are not required to provide information in response to Requests to Know more than twice in a 12-month period. Any response to a Request to Know will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable request.

Additional California Privacy Rights

You have the right to ask us one time each year if we have shared personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Please note, however, that we do not currently disclose any of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature. This feature lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. These features are not yet uniform across browsers. Our website is not currently set up to respond to those signals.

Updates or Amendments To The Privacy Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, in our sole discretion, and the most current version will always be posted on our website or Application (as reflected in the “Last Revised” heading). In the event of a material change to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you through the Services or via email, or you may be notified within the Application. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Services, following the notification of such amendments, constitutes your acknowledgement and consent of such amendments to the Privacy Policy and your agreement to be bound by the terms of such amendments.
