### Use of Personal Data

The amount of personal data we collect and process depends on whether you purchase tickets through our service.

**Ticket Purchasers**
---------------------

If you make a purchase from our service, we classify you as a “Ticket Purchaser” as well as a Website Visitor. In this case, we also collect the information you provide to us in order to complete your purchase, to provide customer service to you, and to keep a record of that transaction in order to operate our business. Your information is also shared with the organizers and/or promoters of Your Ticketed Event.

Event organizers may request additional information from you during the purchase process, and that information will also be shared if provided by you. We are not liable for the manner in which this information is used by organizers and promoters. Unless required by a court order, subpoena or other law or to defend against legal claims, we will not provide your personally-identifiable information to any other third parties without your consent.

### Security of the Information We Collect

We use reasonable measures in keeping with the standard industry practice to protect the security of the information we collect from you and to prevent its unauthorized access.

If you would like to stop receiving automated e-mails from us, simply reply with “unsubscribe” in the subject line. However, you many not unsubscribe from receiving e-mails from us regarding your ticket purchase or Your Ticketed Event.

### Confirmation of Your Order

Bold Type Tickets processes ticket orders only after verifying your billing information. Upon submitting your payment information and purchasing a ticket, you should receive a confirmation of your order by e-mail. If you don’t receive a confirming e-mail or you see an error message, it is your responsibility to confirm with Bold Type Tickets (support@boldtypetickets.com) that your ticket purchase has been placed. Unless you advise Bold Type Tickets of the lack of confirmation, Bold Type Tickets may not be aware of any problem with your attempted ticket purchase. If you fail to advise Bold Type Tickets of the lack of confirmation, Bold Type Tickets shall not be responsible for any monetary or other losses that may result to you.

### Ticket Refund Policy

All events are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice. All sales are final. No refunds except in case of a cancellation. Refund policies are set by the event organizers.

Bold Type Tickets will not be liable for any travel or other costs incurred as a result of event changes or cancellations.

### Ticket Delivery Methods

Tickets are generally delivered through one of three methods: Print-at-Home/digital delivery, will-call, or postal mail. The delivery options for specific events will be shown during the checkout process.

• Print-at-home tickets are delivered via email to the supplied email address directly after the purchase is complete. Tickets can then be printed by the customer on any standard printer.  
• Will-call tickets are not physical tickets. The purchaser’s name, along with any other names specified during checkout, will be delivered to the venue or event promoters for admission to the event. Typically attendees will have to present photo ID to be admitted.
