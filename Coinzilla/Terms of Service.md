11. The Company may offer Advertisers discounts, rebates, or other promotions in respect of the Services offered, in accordance with its commercial policy. Any such discounts or other types of promotions will be displayed on the Website.
12. In order to start using the Services, Advertisers have to pay to the Company, in advance, a minimum amount of EUR 100. The amounts paid may be spent on any campaign type offered by the Company. For the amounts paid in advance to the Company by the Advertiser (which represent the counter-value of the Services provided by the Company through the Platform), the Company will issue relevant invoices. Advertisers' active campaigns will receive traffic as long as the price for the supply of these Campaigns is paid in advance. For information purposes, the value of the amounts paid to the Company by the Advertiser is recorded in the User account of the Advertiser. The value standing to the balance of the User account shall be updated to the extent that the Company provides Services to the Advertiser, as per the latter's instructions. The balance of the User account shall indicate at any time the value of the amounts paid in advance by the Advertising Agent and in consideration for which no Services have been provided yet by the Company. If the Advertiser's User account balance becomes zero, i.e. there are no further amounts paid in advance by the Advertising Agent and not used, all Campaigns activated through its user account will be stopped immediately.
13. The price for the Services provided by the Company is calculated based on the price model of the advertising Campaign type chosen by the Advertiser (i.e., CPM) and statistics gathered by the Company. For details, please refer to Insertion Order form that you can find on the Website.
    
    CPM = Cost per thousand impressions.

Should the Advertiser refuse to fill in this information, the Company reserves the right to suspend or/and delete the user account.

### E) Refund Policy

24. ALL AMOUNTS PAID BY ADVERTISING AGENTS AND REFLECTED IN USERS' ACCOUNTS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
25. Advertisers may pause or stop their Campaign(s) at any time, without having to give any explanation, using the dashboard offered. The Campaign(s) can be resumed at a later time.

The Company reserves the right to make adjustments to the amounts payable to the Publishers (the value of which is recorded for informative purposes in the user account as well) in one of the following cases: (a) deduct payment and/or transaction fees; (b) as a consequence of the fraudulent activity of a Publisher; (c) as a consequence of Advertiser's complaints or refunds made to Advertisers; (d) due to technical reasons, and € any other justified cases.
21. Publishers must keep their user accounts active. If a Publisher hasn't logged during 1 year, the Company may deem the user account inactive. In such case, the Company will permanently delete the account, with no way of receiving the amounts in consideration for the services provided and not yet invoiced, as such are recorded in the user account, upon expiry of the 1-year term.

Self-billed invoices will contain any information required by the applicable law and will be issued in EUR. The Publishers are obliged to notify the Company immediately regarding any change in the information initially provided to the Company and included in the self-billed invoices or regarding any additional information that needs to be provided in the self-billed invoices in order to comply with the applicable law. Each self-billed invoice will be considered accepted if the Publisher does not reject it within 24 hours from the date of issue. Publishers agree to not issue separate invoices for the transactions covered by the self- billed invoices.

### C) Use of funds

24. The minimum amount for which you can request payment for the services provided is EUR 50. For the Company to be able to pay such amounts, your profile needs to be filled in with your real personal information (first and last name, email address, country of residence, and full address). If your user account is a company account, your company details need to be filled in as well. After the transfer of the amounts owed by the Company to you, the information recorded in the user account shall be updated by deducting from the existing balance the equivalent of the amounts already paid as per the information above.
25. All payments related to the services provided through the Coinzilla Platform shall be made by the Company in EUR. The amounts requested in ETH, BTC, or other similar cryptocurrencies shall be converted via an authorized third-party payment processor. The Company will not cover the fees and commissions related to any transaction (including conversion costs) for the amounts requested in ETH and BTC or other similar cryptocurrencies. The Company will not cover the fees or commissions applied by the bank to transfer the amounts owed for the advertising services earned where the Publishers has the account opened. Any such fees and commissions borne by the Company for the transfer of the amounts to the Publishers shall be deducted from the amounts owed by the Company to the Publishers.
26. In order for us to be able to pay the sums representing the prices of the services provided, you must have filled in all the information required when creating the user account, including the choice of the payment interval, respectively, weekly or monthly.
27. Each type of currency corresponds to a type of address. Requesting the payment of the amounts owed to you to an address that does not support the selected currency will result in a permanent loss of your funds.
28. The payment request solicited by the Publisher will be made automatically according to the settings in the user's account, with regards to the payment interval, respectively, weekly or monthly. Such a request is generally processed within 1-2 business days, but can take up to a week, depending on the working conditions of the network.
29. When the payment request is generated for the Publisher (legal entity or an individual), the customer's information regarding his identity and activity is verified by our team to comply with our legal obligations and tax responsibilities. These checks ensure the security and the accuracy of the information in the account and minimize any discomfort that could arise later in the case of tax discrepancies.  
    
    1. In the case of legal entities, if the data from public sources proves that the company no longer exists/is dissolved, has ceased, or has suspended its activity, our compliance team will withdraw the verification and cancel the payment until the other way is confirmed.
    2. In the case of individuals, our team checks whether the KYC process has been completed following the requirements of our verification provider. Depending on the particularities of each account, our compliance team may block the account or ask the individual Publisher to repeat the personal identification process.
    
    Following these verifications carried out by our compliance team, the Company reserves the right to withhold or block the amounts from the Publisher's account and cancel the payment request or deactivate the user account.  
      
    The Publishers (legal entities or individuals), corroborating these provisions with clause 5.10, have one year from being notified until their account is deleted for inactivity.  
      
    **As a rule, all our legal partners have the obligation and the responsibility to announce any change of business nature which could affect their relationship with the Company. In this case, you can contact our Compliance team using the following email address: kyc@coinzilla.com.**
30. Our Compliance team could cancel the payment or / and deactivate the account of the Publisher without being limited to the following situations:
    * The legal entity registered in Coinzilla no longer exists/is dissolved, suspended, or has any other status with which the Company could not be part of a business relationship.
    * The legal entity registered as a user of Coinzilla refuses to collaborate and update its billing information with accurate information.
    * The Company discovers that the Publisher's websites registered on Coinzilla account receive bot traffic.
    * Or any other situation that could affect the Company, the Ad network of Coinzilla or Coinzilla’s Advertising activity and its Advertisers.Please note, that continuously, our compliance team is monitoring the clients of Coinzilla as a part of the Company's responsibility to comply with the anti-money laundering laws, protect our clients, by offering them security in making transactions with Coinzilla, and ensure our integrity is never compromised by unlawful activity on Coinzilla.
31. Users cannot change their account type in Coinzilla from an individual to a company account or from a company account to an individual account and neither transfer the balance from one account to another account, except the case when the same legal entity or individual is behind that Coinzilla accounts.
32. Users who are individuals and not legal entities should ensure that the address introduced in the address field matches the address from the identity document used during the KYC verification. If we discover during our verifications that the address needs to be completed or corrected an e-mail will be sent from us for the correct information within 5 days. In case the user does not provide accurate information within this term, the verification of the account will be withdrawn and the user must contact our compliance team to reactivate it.
