* The display of interest-based ads from Coinzilla can be disabled by clicking on the opt-out button below. It should be noted that you will still be able to see Coinzilla's content recommendations even if the opt-out function is enabled. Opting out prevents Coinzilla from using your Information to generate recommendations based on your particular interests. The recommendations you will receive from now on will be based on the specific website you are visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).

You can opt out using our form at the Coinzilla opt-out page.

* Not Opted-Out: You will receive personalized recommendations from Coinzilla based on your browsing history.
* Opted-Out: Your activity will no longer be tracked by Coinzilla, and therefore, you will not be receiving personalized content recommendations derived from your past online activities.
    * As we individually track device or browser operations, you will need to opt out on each device and browser individually in order to opt out completely across multiple devices.
    * Your opt-out may not come into effect if your browser is set to reject cookies, as we have already recognized your opt-out configuration based on an opt-out cookie that we've sent to you. For the opt-out to be effective in this scenario, you will be required to confirm that your browser has the proper configuration. Users that have a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra first have to change their Privacy and Security Settings in order to disable "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" and "Block All Cookies" and then access, once again, this privacy policy or their opt-out platform of choice to reset the opt-out settings.
    * Technologies that do not use cookies may be used by Coinzilla in very few specific situations. These technologies work in a similar manner to cookies, as they help us create tailored ad recommendations based on your interests and verify if the opt-out function was enabled. Please keep in mind that you may not be able to restrict the use of non-cookie technologies with certain web browsers, but you can go to the "User Choices" section on this page and click on the Opt-Out feature to have this function enabled.
* Users can also disable getting targeted ads from Coinzilla and other advertising companies.
    * The NAI opt out tool stops Coinzilla and other NAI-approved member companies from sending you targeted ads. The NAI offers a guideline on how to opt out from mobile devices that run on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone operating systems.
    * The Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites also feature more information regarding User Choices and how to disable targeted advertising for each of the member companies.

Opting out prevents these companies from using your Information to create ad recommendations based on your particular interests. The recommendations you will receive from now on will be based on the specific website you are visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).
    * Your opt-out may not be effective if your browser has been set to reject opt-out cookies when visiting DAA, DAAC, or EDAA consumer choice pages (these cookies notice companies if your opt-out preference is enabled).

**2.7 How We Keep User information**

For ad-related purposes, User Information may be held for twelve (12) months since the User last interacted with our Services, after which we will de-identify the information by removing unique identifiers or aggregating the data.

**3.4. Third-Party Online Advertising**

We may collaborate with third-parties that employ their proprietary cookies, web beacons, and other technologies which record Site Visitors' online activities, either on our Sites and/or other sites, so that we can provide personalized advertisements that are suited to your interests.

Advertisers and ad networks are some of the included third-parties that may gather data upon your view or interaction with their advertisements and may also collect Information on your web browsing activities either on our Sites or other different sites.

The ad placement of Coinzilla is based on the principle that they should be featured in places that are of interest and have the most relevance to visitors. By enabling ad networks to place their own cookies when our Sites receive a visitor, we are able to place our ads organically.

Ad networks are able to identify past visitors of Coinzilla’s Sites through the use of these cookies. The ad network will be able to deliver a Coinzilla advertisement on any of its new ad spaces on a third-party website to the same individual that visited the Coinzilla Sites, as its cookies recorded his activity and noted his interest in Coinzilla.

To find out more details regarding the collection of Site Visitor Information through third parties, please read our Cookie Policy.

**3.5. Site Visitor Options**

Site Visitors may opt out of third-party ad networks and advertisers that collect Information on the Sites that serve ads about Coinzilla.

The advertisements you will receive from now on will be based on the specific website you are visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).
