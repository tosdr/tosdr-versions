Consumer Purchase Terms and Conditions
======================================

**Rad Power Bikes Inc.**

_Last updated July 30, 2024_

These Consumer Purchase Terms and Conditions (the “**Terms**”) are a legal agreement between you (“**You**” or “**Customer**”) and Rad Power Bikes Inc., a Delaware corporation (“**RPB**”, “**us**” or “**we**”), and apply to all consumer purchases by you of any model of RPB’s electric bikes (“**ebike(s)**”) and/or related accessories or other products offered by RPB (collectively with ebikes, the “**Products**”) in the United States only. Purchases in Canada and the European Union must be made through their respective websites and are subject to the applicable Terms and Conditions contained on their website. You represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years of age or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (the “Minimum Age”), whichever is higher. If you are under the Minimum Age, you are not eligible to make a purchase with RPB. By purchasing any Products from RPB, whether online or at our showroom, or by using the Products you thereby agree to these Terms in their entirety. **Please read these Terms carefully as they list your obligations and rights and include a requirement that all disputes that you may have under these Terms be taken to arbitration, instead of a jury trial or class action, and that you waive certain rights relating to certain claims or relief.**

1\. Application
---------------

These Terms apply to your purchase of the Products and use of the ebikes. Other interactions that you have with RPB are subject to other agreements, including the:  
1.      Limited Warranty Terms  
2.      Terms of Use  
3.      Privacy Notice  
4.      Owner’s Manual  
  
A copy of these Terms and all other documents which apply to your purchase of Products are available for you to read on our website.

2\. Ebike Online Or In-Store Orders
-----------------------------------

In the event you are purchasing an ebike (i) by ordering online, (ii) in an RPB retail store (as opposed to a direct purchase in store of in-stock item), or (iii) through Rad Mobile Service, your order of an ebike is an offer to buy. RPB will send you an email confirming our receipt of your order. RPB has accepted your order upon shipment of the ebike. We reserve the right at any time, even after we send you a confirmation email, to decline or cancel your order or to limit order quantities for any reason, including errors or suspected fraud.  
a. **Orders Placed Via Affirm.** Orders placed using Affirm as a payment method via www.radpowerbikes.com must be shipped and cannot be picked up in store. If you would like to pick up a bike from our Seattle store and purchase using financing, you may do so at time of purchase at our shop at the following address: 1128 NW 52nd St. Seattle, WA 98107.b. From time to time, in its sole discretion, RPB may promote special offers, codes or referral programs for certain sales or product launches. Special offers, codes, and referral programs may not be combined and RPB reserves the right to end or pause all such offers, codes, or programs at any time.

3\. Refer A Friend Program Terms/Limitations
--------------------------------------------

To qualify for a Referral Reward, the referred person must (i) be a new customer, (ii) provide the name of the referring individual at time of purchase, (iii) make a purchase on www.radpowerbikes.com in an amount greater than the minimum amount specified in the referral offer, and (iv) not use any other active promotion or discount on their purchase. Referring customers will receive a Referral Reward after the referral is confirmed and the referral credit is approved by a customer service member. Customers are limited to referring two (2) people per household. Referring customers may only earn one (1) referral credit per referred person.

Please note that information on RPB’s Site or other manuals or documents regarding the expected range on a single charge on one of our ebikes is an estimate, not a guarantee. There are many factors that contribute to actual, real-world range for an ebike battery such as age of the battery, temperature, level of assist, speed, payload, and terrain. Given the right conditions, it is possible to get less than the expected minimum range or greater than the expected maximum range. RPB reserves the right to use substitute parts, material, or equipment of equivalent quality and value that meet RPB’s strict standards)

1. RPB’s EBIKES ARE NOT TO BE OPERATED BY ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 16. Children under the age of 16 may lack the necessary judgement and skill to safely operate the ebike, potentially resulting in damage to the ebike, damage to other property, serious injury, and/or death. You assume the responsibility to ensure the age of the operator is at least 16 years old and comply with your local laws and regulations regarding operator age and other qualifications  
    
2. **IN THE EVENT A MINOR OPERATES THE EBIKE, THE MINOR AND THEIR PARENT/GUARDIAN ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS THE MINOR MAY TAKE AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WAIVE ANY CLAIMS RELATED TO SUCH ACTIVITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLAIMS ASSERTING PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE.** Please see subsection 9(h) below regarding waiver of claims subject to this Section 9.
3. Riding any bike, ebike, etrike, or similar vehicle without a helmet puts you at very high risk of serious head injury or death. Always wear a properly fitted helmet that covers the forehead (this applies to rides of any distance). Many locations require specific safety devices. You assume full responsibility to familiarize yourself and ensure the operator and any passengers adhere applicable helmet and safety laws or regulation where you ride.  
4. Any bike, ebike, etrike, or similar vehicle is subject to wear and tear, and certain components and fasteners can stretch or loosen with the vibrations and stress of normal operation. You must check your ebike/etrike before each ride and according to the other checklist contained in your ebike/etrike’s owner’s manual. Failure to do so could result in property damage, serious injury, or death. You assume full responsibility to perform a pre-ride safety check on the ebike/etrike before each ride

6. Incorrect assembly, maintenance, or use of your ebike/etrike can cause component or performance failure, loss of control. Serious injury, or death. You must read and understand the entire owner’s manual that came with your ebike/etrike and any documentation provided for subcomponents or accessories before riding. Unless your ebike/etrike was assembled by RPB’s retail or service team, you assume full responsibility for the proper maintenance and the proper assembly and/or reassembly of your ebike/etrike.
7. Using a damaged battery or charger can damage additional components or create a fire hazard. Stop using your battery and charger and contact RPB if any of the following occur: (1) your charger’s flexible power cord or output cable or any of the electrical cables on your ebike/etrike is frayed, has broken insulation, or any other signs of damage, (2) your battery or charger is physically damaged, non-functional, or performing abnormally, (3) your battery or charger experienced a significant impact from a fall, crash, or shipping damage, with or without obvious sighs of damage, (4) your battery was submerged in liquid or had extensive water exposure or damage, or (5) your charger becomes too hot to touch (it’s designed to get warm with normal use), make an unusual smell, makes a popping sound, or shows other structures and, as soon as possible, recycle or otherwise dispose of it according to local rules.
8. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS RPB from all liabilities, causes or actions, claims, and demands that arise in any way from any injury, death, loss, or harm that you sustain or that any other person or any property sustained as a result of your use of the ebike/etrike.

20\. General
------------

Section titles are only for convenience and have no legal or contractual significance. Any list of examples following “including” or “e.g.,” is illustrative and not exhaustive, unless qualified by terms like “only” or “solely.” RPB’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its rights to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining terms, covenants and restrictions will remain in full force and effect. You and RPB intend that the provisions of these Terms be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Accordingly, you and RPB agree that if any provision is deemed unenforceable, where possible, it will be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, which may include its deletion. RPB may assign its rights and delegate its obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you, and these Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of RPB’s successors and assigns. RPB shall have the right to assign these Terms, at its sole discretion, without notice to you. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense your rights (if any). These Terms (including any incorporated terms) and any Additional Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and RPB with respect to the Site.

The preceding sentence will not limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law. No one other than you and RPB, or RPB’s successors and assigns, will have any right to enforce these Terms.

--------------------------------------------------------------

We pride ourselves in being nothing but respectful, kind, patient, friendly, and all other pleasant terms that could fit in the mix, and it is critical that those things are returned to our team by customers. We understand that oftentimes when you call/email customer support, it is because something has gone wrong or there is an issue with your purchase (which is the worst!). We also understand that these potential issues cause frustration and sometimes anger; however, we will NOT tolerate rude/vulgar language towards our staff. We will offer a warning if this occurs, after which we do reserve the right to refuse service, terminate your account, issue refunds, void warranties, or cancel orders, each at our sole discretion. If this decision is made it is final and cannot be undone.
