Privacy Notice
==============

**Rad Power Bikes Inc.**

_Last updated June 24, 2024_

At Rad Power Bikes, we love learning about our riders – who you are, where you bike, and the adventures you’ve had riding Rad. But we want to learn more about you in a way that’s fair and honest, which is why we follow privacy guidelines. We’re guessing reading a privacy policy isn’t your idea of a good time and that you’d rather be riding than read a bunch of legalese. So, we aimed to keep our Privacy Policy as straight-forward as possible about the data we may collect about you and your rights and choices about what we can or cannot do with that information. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy. But if you’d rather get the highlight reel version, the TLDR version is [here](#privacy-101).

We’re not into hiding the ball, so if you have any questions or want to contact us about our Privacy Policy, you can reach us by email at [privacy@radpowerbikes.com](mailto:privacy@radpowerbikes.com). If you prefer snail mail, please send your communication [here](#contact-us); or if you’re a phone person, our toll-free phone number is (800) 939-0310.

To make sure we’re on the same page, when we refer to “Rad,” “RPB,” “we,” “us,” “our,” etc., we mean Rad Power Bikes Inc. The “we” does not include our independent third-party business partners or retail sellers who have their own privacy policies and practices.    

Privacy 101 – the TLDR version  

---------------------------------

**We’ll cut to the chase about what a lot of people may worry about: We do not sell your information and you can change cookie preferences to ask us not to share your information (but keep in mind, sharing helps us cater our messages or content that are of interest to you).**

* * Strictly necessary

What This Privacy Policy Covers  

----------------------------------

To use some of our products and services, you may provide us with personal information. Personal Information means information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with or linked directly or indirectly to a specific person or household. For our customers who are citizens and residents of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, personal information has the same meaning, but does not include information that could identify a household. Anonymized information – meaning, information that cannot identify or be linked to a specific person or household – isn’t personal information. Anonymized information means personal data where specific identifying information is removed (e.g., stripped of identifying information in a way that someone could not reverse engineer it to make it personally identifiable).  

This Privacy Policy applies to:

1. Information you provide to us;
2. Information we may collect when you access our Websites;
3. Information we receive from third parties
