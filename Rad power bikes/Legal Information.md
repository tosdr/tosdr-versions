Privacy Notice
==============

**Rad Power Bikes Inc.**

_Last updated June 24, 2024_

At Rad Power Bikes, we love learning about our riders – who you are, where you bike, and the adventures you’ve had riding Rad. But we want to learn more about you in a way that’s fair and honest, which is why we follow privacy guidelines. We’re guessing reading a privacy policy isn’t your idea of a good time and that you’d rather be riding than read a bunch of legalese. So, we aimed to keep our Privacy Policy as straight-forward as possible about the data we may collect about you and your rights and choices about what we can or cannot do with that information. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy. But if you’d rather get the highlight reel version, the TLDR version is [here](#privacy-101).

We’re not into hiding the ball, so if you have any questions or want to contact us about our Privacy Policy, you can reach us by email at [privacy@radpowerbikes.com](mailto:privacy@radpowerbikes.com). If you prefer snail mail, please send your communication [here](#contact-us); or if you’re a phone person, our toll-free phone number is (800) 939-0310.

To make sure we’re on the same page, when we refer to “Rad,” “RPB,” “we,” “us,” “our,” etc., we mean Rad Power Bikes Inc. The “we” does not include our independent third-party business partners or retail sellers who have their own privacy policies and practices.

What This Privacy Policy Covers
-------------------------------

To use some of our products and services, you may provide us with personal information. Personal Information means information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with or linked directly or indirectly to a specific person or household. For our customers who are citizens and residents of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, personal information has the same meaning, but does not include information that could identify a household. Anonymized information – meaning, information that cannot identify or be linked to a specific person or household – isn’t personal information. Anonymized information means personal data where specific identifying information is removed (e.g., stripped of identifying information in a way that someone could not reverse engineer it to make it personally identifiable).  

This Privacy Policy applies to:

1. Information you provide to us;
2. Information we may collect when you access our Websites;
3. Information we receive from third parties

Information You Provide to Us
-----------------------------

When you interact with Rad’s Websites and/or make use of our services, you share personal information. Personal Information or personal data means information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with or linked directly or indirectly to a specific individual or household. The categories/sources of personal information Rad may collect from or about you include:

* **Contact Information.** When you purchase a Rad bike online or in-store, perform a test ride, create an account on our Websites ([https://www.radpowerbikes.com](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/ "Rad Power Bikes US Site"); [https://radpowerbikes.ca](https://radpowerbikes.ca/ "Rad Power Bikes Canada Site"); and [https://radpowerbikes.eu](https://radpowerbikes.eu/ "Rad Power Bikes European Site")), participate in our contests/sweepstakes, use our customer service options, sign up for email notices or promotions, or register your Rad bike, you may provide certain personal contact information such as:
    * First and last name
    * Home or mailing address
    * Email address and telephone number
    * Certain financial information, such as debit/credit card information
    * Emergency contact information (for example, if you do a test ride). Please note, if you submit information about other people to us or our service providers in connection with your interactions with us, you’re making the representation that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use that information per our Privacy Policy)
* **Government-Issued Identification.** If you take a test ride on a Rad bike or if you submit an application for employment with Rad, we may ask you to provide additional information shown on a government-issued ID documentation such as:  
    * Birth date
    * Driver’s license or other government-issued ID (which may reflect information like birth date, gender, or your photo)
    * Social Security number (we won’t collect this for applicants, only for those who decide to accept an employment offer)
* **Biometric Data.** If you stop by one of our retail locations with a video security system, we may unintentionally capture your image. Don’t worry, that image will not be posted anywhere and is used for security reasons.
* **Payment Information.**  If you buy a product at one of our retail stores, we will ask for your payment information to process payment, such as credit card, debit card, or other payment method. For online purchases, you’ll be redirected to a third-party payment processor’s site to process payment. Our third-party payment processors have their own privacy policy which we do not control. We may also make financing options available for purchases. If you decide to get financing, you will be sent to a third-party’s site where they may collect and/or get access to information like your credit rating. We do not control or have access to such information.
* **Feedback/Customer Service.** If you respond to a survey about your experience with us, offer opinions or reviews on our Websites, or interact with us on social media, we may ask for information like your name and email address, for example. If ever you need help with a product or seek other customer support services such as our online chat feature, we collect data from those interactions. We may also collect purchase history information like products you bought, returned, or exchanged.
* **Job Applications.** If you apply for a job with us, we will collect information from your application or resume. If you get an offer and become a part of Team Rad, you may additionally be asked to provide information under the “Government-Issued Identification” section above.

Information We May Collect When You Access our Websites
-------------------------------------------------------

Rad may collect information when you visit our Websites – even if you don’t make a purchase or set up an account. Rad is not an exception; almost every commercial website uses certain technology that collects information even if you don’t actively provide information. Importantly, **WE DO NOT SELL YOUR INFORMATION.** We use the information we collect to improve our customers’ experience on the Websites, to improve our services and products, and, if applicable, tailor advertising or communications to you.

We regularly update and test our security measures to improve the protection of your personal information and to ensure the integrity of that information.

We also limit those at Rad who can access personal information on a need-to-know basis and periodically provide employee privacy training to ensure our team understands and exercises best practices to protect personal information.

Finally, we keep your personal information only for so long as needed for legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal or other obligations.

Please note, if we cannot verify that you’re you, we may not be able to delete the information. For example, if someone says “delete my data” but does not include information that allows us to verify the request is legitimately coming from you, e.g., providing the email address matching the email address we have on file, the name of the person making the request lines up with the name of the person we have, etc. Basically, we need to be able to confirm that the data subject is the person making the deletion request.
* **Right to Opt-Out**. Generally, consumers can request commercial entities stop selling or sharing your personal information. We don’t sell your personal information.
