Terms & Conditions of Use  

============================

Below are SmugMug's Terms of Use. For a more easily digestible summary, see our "Guide to the Terms of Use for Regular People" [here](https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms/guide).

For Flickr's Terms of Use click [here](https://www.flickr.com/help/terms).

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE ("TERMS OF USE") CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEB SITE OR APPLICATION, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE WHEN PROMPTED BY SMUGMUG, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.

These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see [Section 15 — Dispute Resolution](https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms#Dispute)). These Terms of Use also contain provisions requiring you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court. If you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the SmugMug Services.  

Welcome to SmugMug! SmugMug.com (the **_"Site"_**) provides our users with online tools designed to facilitate and share our love of photography and videos and to promote camaraderie. These Terms of Use protect the legal interests of SmugMug, our users and our third party vendors.  
  
This Site is owned and operated by SmugMug, Inc. and our respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors (collectively, **_"SmugMug"_**). These Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of the Site, the Subscription Services (as defined below) and any other online services provided by SmugMug, including SmugMug mobile and Apple TV applications (collectively with the Site and the rest of the foregoing, the **_"Services"_**). For example, these Terms of Use apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise and products (**_"Products"_**) through SmugMug's approved third party vendors and retailers (**_"SmugMug Vendors"_**).  
  
Your use of the Services and your purchase of Products is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use. If you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use SmugMug or any SmugMug Services. If you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.  
  
The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16. If you are between the ages of 16 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.  
  
SmugMug reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified. Such notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug. Your continued use of the Services, or your purchase of any Products or the Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Otherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.  
  
You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.smugmug.com/about/privacy). For residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and SmugMug will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires SmugMug to have your consent.

License Agreements  

SmugMug enables certain users who own or otherwise have the right to license Media (the "Content Owner") to use SmugMug to facilitate the license of their Media to other SmugMug users. Please refer to the terms of your Subscription Plan to determine whether you are a Content Owner with the right to license your Media through SmugMug. All such licenses are made _directly_ between the user and the Content Owner and are merely facilitated by SmugMug. The scope of the license rights granted by the Content Owner to the SmugMug user under any license will vary depending on the type of license that the Content Owner designates to such Media.  
  
By uploading Media to the SmugMug Services and indicating that the Media may be licensed by other SmugMug users, Content Owners agree to be bound by and accept the terms and conditions set forth in Section D below. By licensing any Media from a Content Owner through the Services, you agree to the terms of the applicable end user license agreement that has been chosen by the Content Owner (either the [Commercial Use License](https://help.smugmug.com/customer/portal/articles/93346-sell-digital-downloads#commercial) or [Personal Use License](https://help.smugmug.com/customer/portal/articles/93346-sell-digital-downloads#personal)).  
  
Please note that if you download Media from the Services, you are not automatically granted any license rights by the Content Owner to such Media.

If you have any questions regarding Media licenses, please contact us at [help@smugmug.com](mailto:help@smugmug.com).

### 10\. Third Party Services

SmugMug does not indicate affiliation, approval, or control of any Third Party Services by making such Third Party Services available via the SmugMug Services. SmugMug makes no claim or representation regarding, and accepts no responsibility for, the quality, accuracy, nature, ownership or reliability of Third Party Services.

### 15\. Dispute Resolution  

Applicable Law  

Your use of the Services is subject to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations. These Terms of Use and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  

Agreement to Arbitrate & Waiver of Representative Actions  

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SMUGMUG AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 15, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SMUGMUG SERVICES.  

You and SmugMug agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or relating to the Services, Site or SmugMug Materials. **ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.** You and SmugMug agree: (i) to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises; (ii) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (iii) that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California; and (iv) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (**_"AAA"_**), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable). The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. Other than class procedures and remedies described in these Terms of Use, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section does NOT prevent the parties from seeking public injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, and you and SmugMug are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.  
  
The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different SmugMug users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same SmugMug user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  
  
YOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SMUGMUG USERS.  
  
Some jurisdictions may limit or prohibit arbitration agreements or class action waivers. If you are a resident of such a jurisdiction, the arbitration agreement and class action waivers above are not applicable to you. Unless you and SmugMug agree otherwise, in the event that a court decides that any part of this Section 15 is invalid or unenforceable, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and SmugMug must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California. The remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.

### B. Additional Terms Applicable to Subscription Services ("Subscription Services Terms")  

You may use the Subscription Services only in accordance with these Subscription Services Terms (and the Terms of Use of which they are a part). In the event of any conflict between these Subscription Services Terms and the other provisions of the Terms of Use, these Subscription Services Terms will control.  

### 1\. Subscriptions  

The Subscription Services are available to users (i) who register for a free trial (when available) or for a subscription to the Subscription Services (**_"Subscription"_**) and (ii) who pay in full the Subscription fees (**_"Subscription Fees"_**) applicable to the level of Subscription selected by such user (the **_"Subscription Plan"_**).  
  
If you wish to purchase a Subscription, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to facilitate such purchase, including your credit card number, billing address and any related payment information as required by SmugMug (collectively, **_"Payment Information"_**). SmugMug may use a third party payment processor (e.g., Amazon Payments or PayPal) to facilitate your payment of any Subscription Fees. Any Payment Information that you provide will be governed by the terms of our Privacy Policy. By submitting Payment Information via the Services, you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.  

### 2\. Free Trials  

When you first register for the Subscription Services, SmugMug may offer you the ability to use the Subscription Services without charge for a limited trial period (a **_"Free Trial"_**). The duration of a Free Trial will be the number of days specified by SmugMug at the time of your registration for such Free Trial. You do not need to provide SmugMug with a credit card or other Payment Information in order to register for a Free Trial. At the conclusion of your Free Trial, your user account will automatically terminate unless you elect to continue to use the Subscription Services by selecting a Subscription Plan and providing SmugMug (or our applicable third party payment processor) with valid Payment Information. Upon SmugMug's receipt of your Payment Information, you will be charged for the Subscription Fee applicable to your selected Subscription Plan. SmugMug may offer you the ability to register for a Subscription directly without the need to participate in a Free Trial.  

### 3\. Subscription Plans  

SmugMug offers a variety of Subscription Plans designed to reflect the diverse needs of our users, each with its own features, descriptions, functionality and terms with respect to the use of the Services. A description of each Subscription Plan that is currently offered by SmugMug is available [here](https://www.smugmug.com/plans). By purchasing a Subscription, (i) you agree to pay all applicable Subscription Fees and other charges in accordance with your selected Subscription Plan, pursuant to the renewal and termination provisions described below (including any applicable taxes, such as sales tax), and (ii) you agree that you are only entitled to the features and services applicable to the Subscription Plan that you select at the time you purchase a Subscription.  
  
The Subscription Services are intended to be used by SmugMug users for the distribution and sharing of Photos and/or Videos, as permitted under the user's applicable Subscription Plan. SmugMug, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your use of the Subscription Services if SmugMug determines that you have violated these Subscription Services Terms or the Terms of Use.  
  
Each Subscription is personal to the individual SmugMug user. You may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or SmugMug user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.  
  
From time to time, SmugMug may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions. Any user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Subscription Services Terms (including SmugMug's right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).  

### 4\. Term and Automatic Renewal  

Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which SmugMug provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the **_"Commencement Date"_**) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Subscription Services (the **_"Subscription Term"_**).  
  
YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR SMUGMUG PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM. SUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION, OR BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO [HELP@SMUGMUG.COM](mailto:help@smugmug.com) PROVIDING CLEAR WRITTEN NOTICE OF SUCH REQUEST. You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal. If you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.  
  
You may upgrade your Subscription Plan at any time during the Subscription Term by notifying SmugMug using your Account Settings. If you upgrade your Subscription Plan, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed for the difference in price, pro-rated for the remainder of your Subscription Term.  
  
You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Subscription Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term. SmugMug will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew. You hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees and your sole remedy if you disagree with such changes is to terminate your account and stop using the Subscription Services.  

### 5\. Interruptions or Discontinuation of Subscription Services; Changes to Subscription Services and Terms of Use  

SmugMug reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Subscription Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto. If the Subscription Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by SmugMug, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you. You acknowledge that the Subscription Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.  
  
SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO ACCESS ANY MEDIA OR MATERIALS ON THE SERVICES.  

### 6\. Termination of Services  

You may request the termination of your Subscription at any time by canceling your account in the Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending an email to [help@smugmug.com](mailto:help@smugmug.com) providing clear written notice of such request. When SmugMug receives your termination request, SmugMug will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email. SmugMug may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription. Your Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from SmugMug. If you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective _immediately_ upon your receipt of such confirmation from SmugMug, regardless of whether there is any period of time remaining in your Subscription Term. By way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective immediately upon your receipt of confirmation and you will not have access to the Subscription Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.  
  
SmugMug may terminate a Subscription, or any user's access to and use of the Subscription Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately. If you violate the Terms of Use, SmugMug at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that SmugMug deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.  
  
All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable. Upon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.  
  
You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile. It is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date. If the Payment Information for your account is invalid and cannot be billed for the renewal Subscription Fee at the time such Subscription Fee is payable and due, then SmugMug may terminate your account for nonpayment. If SmugMug does not have a current, working email address for your user account, then you may not receive important notices from us regarding your account, including notices regarding termination. SmugMug cannot guarantee that you will receive notice of the termination of your account.  

### 7\. "SmugVault" Account  

SmugMug provides its users of the Subscription Services with the opportunity to obtain a "**SmugVault**" account for increased storage capability. The SmugVault service is provided through Amazon.com's Simple Storage Service (**_"Amazon S3"_**) and is governed by the terms of service for Amazon S3, in addition to these Terms of Use. If you choose to utilize the SmugVault service, you should review Amazon.com's terms of service, as well as its policy regarding privacy and data gathering practices, and any other applicable policies, prior to use of the SmugVault service. In order to utilize the SmugVault service, you must sign up for and obtain an Amazon S3 account.

Accordingly, any questions regarding your Amazon S3 account must be directed to Amazon.com, including but not limited to questions regarding billing. The ability to use the Amazon S3 service in connection with the SmugMug Subscription Services is provided solely as a convenience to you and does not imply endorsement, approval, control or adoption by SmugMug of Amazon S3. SmugMug makes no claim or representation regarding, and accepts no responsibility for, your use of Amazon S3, or for the quality, accuracy, nature, ownership or reliability thereof. Your use of Amazon S3 and SmugVault is solely at your own risk.  

### 8\. Backup Policy  

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING AND MAINTAINING BACKUP COPIES OF ANY USER CONTENT YOU UPLOAD, POST OR MAKE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES DURING ANY APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION TERM AT YOUR SOLE COST AND EXPENSE. YOU MAINTAIN RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES YOU INCUR FOR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN BACKUP COPIES OF YOUR USER CONTENT. SMUGMUG IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT RESULT FROM THE LOSS OR BREACH OF YOUR USER CONTENT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SMUGMUG SERVICES.  
  
SmugMug uses third party vendors to host and store any Media that you upload to SmugMug through your use of the Subscription Services. We may require our vendors to maintain certain standards with respect to your User Content, but SmugMug does not guarantee that your User Content will be secure and/or available at all times during the Subscription Term. SmugMug does not guarantee that your User Content will be available on the Services after the termination of your Subscription, irrespective of the reason for such termination. It is your sole responsibility to create and maintain backup copies of any such User Content on a regular basis.  
  
Please note that when User Content or other files are deleted (or your account is cancelled), those files will be deleted as soon as reasonable pursuant to SmugMug's data destruction policies and cannot be recovered by SmugMug or any third party vendor following deletion (including Amazon S3 if you have subscribed to a SmugMug Vault account).  

### 9\. Use of User Information  

In the event that you obtain access to any SmugMug user information, whether directly from SmugMug or otherwise, including user names and emails (e.g., through the purchase of your Products by a SmugMug user) (collectively the **_"User Information"_**), you agree that you may not use any such User Information in any manner except as may be specifically authorized by SmugMug to carry out the purpose for which such User Information was provided. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not share such User Information with any third parties. Further, you agree not to use such User Information in any manner that would be in violation of SmugMug's Privacy Policy or applicable law. In no event will SmugMug be obligated to provide you with any such User Information. You agree that this provision will apply both during and after the term of your Subscription.  

### 10\. Independent Contractors  

Use of the SmugMug Subscription Services does not create a partnership, agency, joint venture or any employee-employer relationship between you and SmugMug. At all times the relationship between you and SmugMug will be that of independent contractors. You are responsible for all state, local, federal or other taxes that you are obligated to pay in connection with your use of the Subscription Services.  

### 11\. Terms and Conditions Applicable to SmugMug Pro  

Certain Subscription Plans include access to the "SmugMug Pro" services, which include platforms, tools and other features designed for our users who are photography professionals. All SmugMug Pro users must be paid subscribers to a qualifying SmugMug Subscription Plan. For information regarding whether a Subscription Plan constitutes a "SmugMug Pro" plan, please see the description of Subscription Plans available [here](https://www.smugmug.com/plans).  

Profit Payments  

SmugMug Pro users with certain Subscription Plans may be eligible to participate in the SmugMug profit-generation program (the **_"Profit Program"_**). The Profit Program enables qualifying SmugMug Pro users to generate, track and collect payments based on the sale of such user's Photos, Videos and other Products (**_"Profit Payments"_**). In exchange for your participation in the Profit Program, SmugMug will collect a percentage commission on the sale of your Photos, Videos or other Products. In order to participate in the Profit Program, you must at all times be an active subscriber to a qualifying Subscription Plan and you must have paid your Subscription Fee for the applicable Subscription Term. You are not entitled to Profit Payments that are generated during a Free Trial unless you subsequently subscribe to a full Subscription and pay all Subscription Fees associated with a qualifying SmugMug Pro Subscription Plan.  
  
SmugMug may provide additional terms and conditions or policies regarding the Profit Program (including SmugMug's commission percentage) at the profit-generation program home page available [here](https://help.smugmug.com/get-paid-my-profits-Bk6BxlPJESz). Any such terms and conditions or policies with respect to the Profit Program are incorporated herein by reference. SmugMug has the right to change the terms and conditions or other policies governing the Profit Program at any time (including the calculation of earned fees) at its sole discretion by posting such revised terms to the Site.  
  
SmugMug Pro users with certain Subscription Plans may be eligible to offer coupons, discounts, or credits that reduce the charge to the customer for Products purchased and/or branding tools, boutique packaging and other services that increase your cost to SmugMug for the Products sold. These discounts and services may result in the total amount paid by such customer to fall below what you owe SmugMug for that order. In such case, you will be liable for reimbursing SmugMug for the difference between the amount paid by such customer and what you owe SmugMug for that order and, in the case of a print credit, for SmugMug's stated share of the markup on such order. You hereby authorize SmugMug to bill the credit card designated in your Account Settings for such difference. If you have not provided valid credit card information in your Account Settings, you will be responsible for directly reimbursing SmugMug for all such amounts by any designated payment method that SmugMug deems appropriate (including by reducing your Profit Payments). Your failure to provide such reimbursement to SmugMug may result in SmugMug pursuing legal action against you in order to recover such amounts.  
  
Any Profit Payments that you earn through your participation in the Profit Program will be paid to you in connection with the preferences and user settings available in your Account Settings. Any Profit Payments will be paid via electronic bank deposit for all U.S. SmugMug Pro users. For any international SmugMug Pro users, Profit Payments will be paid by electronic means or other payment method offered or used by SmugMug at such time. You are not entitled to any interest payments on Profit Payments, regardless of your preferences for the timing of such Profit Payments. Further, you are not entitled to receive Profit Payments if you have a negative balance on your account or if you currently owe SmugMug any amounts in connection with your participation in any SmugMug programs. In order to be paid Profit Payments, you must submit to SmugMug (i) all requested tax information applicable to you or your business (**_"Tax Information"_**) by correctly filling out and successfully submitting the online tax and payment form available [here](https://secure.smugmug.com/sales/w9/) and (ii) valid and current Payment Information to facilitate the payout of your Profit Payments (including applicable bank information for U.S. SmugMug Pro users). You may be asked to submit Tax Information and Payment Information through your Account Settings or by submitting any other online forms requested by SmugMug from time to time. It is your sole responsibility to keep your Tax Information and Payment Information updated, valid and current throughout the duration of your participation in the Profit Program.  
  
In the event a customer requests a refund or otherwise disputes or changes any order made in connection with the Profit Program (including, but not limited to, the return or destruction of physical Products), SmugMug may adjust any current or future Profit Payments to which you are entitled to reflect such refund, dispute or change. If you do not have a current balance of unpaid Profit Payments sufficient to cover the amount at issue in such refund, dispute or change, you will be responsible for directly reimbursing SmugMug for all such amounts by any designated payment method that SmugMug deems appropriate. Your failure to provide such refunded, disputed or changed Profit Payment amount to SmugMug may result in SmugMug pursuing legal action against you in order to recover such amounts.  
  
SmugMug is entitled to withhold payment of current or future earned fees under the Profit Program, recover any refunded, disputed or changed Profit Payments as set forth above (including any amounts owed by you to SmugMug arising out of the use of coupons, discounts, branding tools, boutique packaging and other services as set forth above) and/or suspend or terminate your participation in the Profit Program if you violate these Terms of Use or otherwise use the Profit Program (i) in violation of applicable law, (ii) in a manner that is misleading, fraudulent or deceptive or (iii) for the purpose of perpetrating any scam or other illicit purpose.  

Termination & Forfeiture of Profits  

If your Subscription is terminated for any reason (including non-payment of Subscription Fees) or if you no longer qualify for the Profit Program for any reason (e.g., you downgrade your Subscription Plan), you are no longer eligible to participate in the Profit Program. In the event of such termination, SmugMug will pay you any outstanding earned Profit Payments if (i) you have provided SmugMug with valid and current Tax Information and Payment Information and (ii) your outstanding Profit Payment amount exceeds the cost of SmugMug's processing fees for such payment. If you do not provide SmugMug with valid and current Tax Information and Payment Information prior to the termination, cancellation, downgrade or other applicable change to your Subscription, or if your outstanding Profit Payment amount does not exceed the cost of SmugMug's processing fees for such payment, you thereby forfeit and waive your rights to any Profit Payments that you have earned as a participant in the Profit Program. IN THE EVENT OF SUCH FORFEITURE, YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, CLAIMS OR OTHER FEES OR PAYMENTS RELATED TO OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE FORFEITURE OF YOUR PROFIT PAYMENTS.  

Taxes  

You are responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with your performance of any activities related to the Profit Program, including, but not limited to, compensation, bonuses, and benefits, if any, for your personnel, and any and all taxes, fees, duties, tariffs or charges that may be imposed on you in connection with your participation in the Profit Program. As such, you acknowledge that any Profit Payments belong to you and not to SmugMug. The Profit Payments represent the only compensation payable by SmugMug to you in connection with your participation in the Profit Program and no other compensation of any kind is payable to you for participating in the Profit Program. In certain jurisdictions, SmugMug may be required to withhold, collect and/or remit certain sales or other taxes in connection with the purchase of Products or your participation in the Profit Program and any such taxes will reduce the Profit Payments you receive.  

### C. Additional Terms Applicable to Sales of Products ("Terms of Sales")  

These Terms of Sale form a part of the Terms of Use applicable to your purchase of any Photos, Videos, or other Products through the SmugMug Services. Other than as specifically provided in any separate written agreement between you and SmugMug, these Terms of Sale may not be altered, supplemented, or amended by the use of any document, such as purchase orders, and all sales are expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Sale. In the event of any conflict between these Terms of Sale and the other provisions of the Terms of Use, these Terms of Sale will control.  
  
SmugMug facilitates your purchase of Photos, Videos or Products through the SmugMug Services through its relationships with the SmugMug Vendors. If you purchase Photos, Videos or other Products through the SmugMug Services, you acknowledge that the printing of any Photos or creation of other physical medium Products is performed by such SmugMug Vendors and SmugMug's role is to assist, facilitate and support such order process pursuant to these Terms of Sale.

You are responsible for any taxes that you are obligated to pay or that SmugMug may collect from you in connection with your purchase of Products. If you do not pay the sales or other taxes or fees on a transaction, you will be responsible for the taxes or fees in the event they are later determined to be payable on the sale, and SmugMug reserves the right to collect the taxes or other related fees from you at any time. In certain jurisdictions, SmugMug may be required to collect and remit sales tax in connection with your purchase of Products. Any such taxes will be added to the purchase price and reflected on your invoice or receipt.

SmugMug is not responsible for any delays in shipping. SmugMug or the SmugMug Vendors reserve the right to substitute another carrier of equal or lesser cost to deliver your order at our discretion. All shipping charges are your responsibility. Shipping charges will be included in your shopping cart and can be viewed on a summary screen prior to finalizing your order. The shipping charge shown during the Product checkout process is subject to verification and to correction or change without notice, provided that if the actual shipping charge is more than the amount shown in your shopping cart, we will contact you with the correct shipping costs before processing your order, and you will have an opportunity to cancel your order. All orders are shipped FOB shipping point. Title to the physical medium of the Products passes from SmugMug to you upon shipment. If an item in your order is temporarily out of stock, we may hold your order until it is complete prior to shipment.
