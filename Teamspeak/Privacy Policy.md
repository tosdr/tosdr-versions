11.1.3 The "AAL" licensing model contract has a minimum term of twelve months.

11.1.4 The "ATHP" licensing model contract has a minimum term of twelve months.

11.1.5 The contract for the "SDK" license model has a individually agreed minimum contract term.

11.2 The contract is automatically extended by the minimum contract term if neither party terminates the contract at the end of the minimum contract term. With the "NPL" license model, the contract is only automatically extended if the customer has used the software solution within a period of one month before termination of the minimum contract term; otherwise the contract automatically ends upon termination of the minimum contract term.

11.3 The license agreement can be terminated by the customer at any time at the end of the minimum contract term without observing a period of notice. TeamSpeak® may terminate the license agreement at any time subject to a notice period equal to half of the minimum contract term to the end of the minimum contract term.

11.4 The right of both parties to extraordinary termination remains unaffected. TeamSpeak® is entitled to an extraordinary right of termination, in particular under the conditions of Section 11.5 of these GTC.

11.5 TeamSpeak® has the right to terminate the contract without notice,

11.5.1.1 if the Customer is in arrears with two successive payments due for licensing.

11.5.1.2 if the customer repeatedly falls below the minimum license fee for an "ATHP" license model contract.

11.5.1.3 if the Customer repeatedly violates his obligations under the License Agreement, including these GTC, despite a warning letter, and the violations are not insignificant.

11.5.1.4 if, despite repeated warnings from TeamSpeak®, the Customer repeatedly breaches his essential obligations under this Agreement and is responsible for the breach.

11.5.1.5 if the Customer has chosen the "Unlicensed" or "NPL" license models without the property of consumer or non-commercial grouping being present or this property having subsequently ceased to exist. In this case, we reserve the right to claim damages.

11.6 Any termination must be made in text form.

16.5 The Customer agrees not to publish any Add Ons to TeamSpeak® that violate the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, the rights of TeamSpeak® or the rights of third parties.

16.6 The customer releases TeamSpeak® from all rights of third parties, which they assert against TeamSpeak® due to the publication of Add Ons on myteamspeak.com by the customer.

C. General terms and conditions
-------------------------------

### 18\. Warranty

18.1 The statutory warranty rights apply to consumers.

18.2 The following provisions shall apply to entrepreneurs:

18.2.1 The customer's warranty rights expire within one year. This does not apply to damages culpably caused by TeamSpeak® from injury to life, body or health and grossly negligent or deliberately caused damages or fraudulent intent, as well as to recourse claims according to §§ 478, 479 BGB (German Civil Code).

18.2.2 Any warranty on the part of TeamSpeak® is excluded if the defect is due to circumstances that TeamSpeak® has caused at the express request of the customer.

18.2.3 The strict liability for damages for initial defects according to § 536a Abs. 1 BGB (German Civil Code) is excluded.

### 19\. Liability

19.1 TeamSpeak® is liable in all cases of contractual and non-contractual liability for intent and gross negligence in accordance with the statutory provisions.

19.2 In other cases TeamSpeak® is only liable - as far as not differently regulated in clause 19.1 of these GTC - in case of violation of a contractual obligation, the fulfilment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance the customer may therefore regularly rely (so-called cardinal obligation). In all other cases, TeamSpeak®'s liability is excluded, subject to the provisions in Section 19.1 of these GTC.

19.3 As far as TeamSpeak® is liable according to clause 19.1 of these GTC, this liability is limited to damages which TeamSpeak® has foreseen as a possible consequence of a breach of contract at the time of conclusion of the contract or which should have been foreseen in case of application of customary care. Indirect damages and consequential damages resulting from defects in performance by TeamSpeak® are only compensable if such damages are typically to be expected when the performance is used as intended.

19.4 The liability of TeamSpeak® for damages from injury to life, body or health and according to the Product Liability Act remains unaffected by the above limitations and exclusions of liability.

### 20\. Offsetting, rights of retention and assignment

20.1 The customer is only entitled to offset against legally established or undisputed claims against TeamSpeak®. The same applies to the assertion of rights of retention.

20.2 The assignment of claims against TeamSpeak® to third parties is only possible with the written consent of TeamSpeak®. This applies in particular to a transfer of the license granted by TeamSpeak® to third parties.

### 21\. Text form

21.1 Amendments and modifications of the agreements made between TeamSpeak® and the customer including these GTC must be made in writing to become effective.

21.2 With the exception of managing directors or authorized signatories, TeamSpeak® employees are not entitled to make any verbal agreements to the contrary.

### 22\. Applicable law and place of jurisdiction

22.1 German law shall apply. In the case of consumers, this choice of law applies only insofar as the protection granted by mandatory provisions of the law of the country of the consumer's habitual residence is not withdrawn (principle of favourability).

22.2 The place of performance for all services arising from business relations with TeamSpeak® and the place of jurisdiction shall be the registered office of TeamSpeak®, provided that the User is not a consumer but a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law. The same applies if the user does not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or the EU or if his place of residence or usual abode is not known at the time the action is filed. The authority to appeal to the court at another legal place of jurisdiction remains unaffected by this.

22.3 The provisions of the UN Sales Convention expressly do not apply.

### 23\. Account Suspension, Termination, and Community Safety

23.3 Appeals Process: Users whose accounts are banned, restricted, or deleted may contact TeamSpeak support to appeal the decision. Appeals will be reviewed at TeamSpeak’s discretion, and the company reserves the right to uphold, modify, or reverse its actions without further explanation.
