As the recipient of e-mail or newsgroup postings, you are responsible for using reasonable efforts to screen unwanted material and reporting any offensive or illegal communications to NetZero.  <br>  <br>Mobile broadband service can suffer from congestion and reduced performance when usage by some individuals exceeds the usage of typical individual consumers, thereby having a negative impact on the entire network. NetZero's mobile broadband ("Mobile Broadband") service is intended for reasonable, non-continuous use by a person using devices authorized by NetZero, consistent with the type of use made by a typical individual consumer of our Internet services. Typical uses include activities such as surfing the web, sending and receiving email either through the NetZero email service or other third party email providers, sending and receiving photographs, occasional online gaming, and the occasional streaming of videos and downloading files.  <br>  <br>These Acceptable Use Guidelines are intended to protect the overall NetZero Services and to ensure the expected use for consumers.  <br>  <br>**2.0 Prohibited Uses of NetZero Services**.  <br>NetZero reserves the right to terminate a subscriber or user's session or access to the NetZero Services at any time without notice if such subscriber or user engages in the following prohibited activities.<br><br>  <br>A.

Miscellaneous.<br><br>* You also agree that you will not use our network to measure the performance of our NetZero Services, or publish information about our network's performance.<br>* Unless otherwise specified, the NetZero Services are provided for your personal, consumer use only, and are not intended for commercial or business use and commercial or business use is prohibited.<br><br>  <br>  <br>**3.0 Enforcement and Network Management.**  <br>In order for NetZero to comply with applicable laws, including without limitation the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 18 U.S.C. 2701 et seq., to comply with appropriate government requests, to operate NetZero's systems properly, or to protect NetZero or its customers, NetZero may access and disclose any information, including, without limitation, the personal identifying information of NetZero account holders, the contents of any personal electronic communications passing through its network, and any other information it considers necessary or appropriate without notice to you. NetZero will cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating suspected violations of the Rules and any other illegal activity. NetZero reserves the right to report to law enforcement authorities any suspected illegal activity of which it becomes aware.  <br>  <br>If NetZero receives a complaint or otherwise becomes aware of any possible violation of the Rules, NetZero may, in its sole discretion, initiate an investigation. This investigation may include gathering information from and about NetZero account holders and examining the content of personal electronic communications or other information on NetZero's servers. During any investigation, NetZero may suspend NetZero Services and access to the NetZero Site and/or remove materials from its servers. You agree to cooperate with any such investigation.  <br>  <br>If NetZero determines, in its sole discretion, that a violation of the Rules has occurred, NetZero may, but will not be obligated, to take any or all of the following actions in addition to legal remedies it may have available: temporarily or permanently remove material from NetZero servers, discontinue access to Usenet newsgroups, cancel newsgroup postings, move posts to a more appropriate forum (if any), warn the account holder(s) involved, remove e-mail sent by you, suspend or terminate account(s), remove or deny access to the NetZero Service, Site or servers, publicly disclose the originating address, subject matter and/or URL of the website or other account information associated with a prohibited transmission and to charge a handling fee associated with taking such action and take other responsive action at any time and for any reason. If NetZero believes that you have used the services to commit trademark or copyright infringement, it will terminate your account privileges. Violations of the Rules could also subject you to criminal or civil liability.  <br>  <br>NetZero reserves the right to engage in reasonable network management to protect the overall Mobile Broadband network, including analyzing traffic patterns and preventing the distribution of viruses or other malicious code. During periods of congestion, NetZero uses various network management techniques, such as reducing the data rate of individual bandwidth intensive users whose use is negatively impacting other users. This temporarily limits the amount of bandwidth available to the bandwidth intensive users until the congestion has diminished, at which point NetZero will endeavor to lift any limits it may have imposed on bandwidth intensive users during the period of congestion. NetZero may also consider historical usage patterns when temporarily reducing the data rate of bandwidth intensive users during periods of congestion. When feasible, upon observation of an excessive use pattern, NetZero will attempt to contact you by telephone (at the telephone number you gave to us) or otherwise alert you to your excessive use of bandwidth and to help you determine the cause. NetZero representatives also are available to explain these Acceptable Use Guidelines and to help you avoid excessive use incidents. If you are unavailable or do not respond to NetZero's attempt to contact you regarding excessive use, or if excessive use is ongoing or recurring and repeatedly having negative effects on other subscribers of the Service, then NetZero reserves the right to immediately restrict, suspend or terminate your Service without further notice in order to protect the network and minimize congestion caused by the excessive use. While the determination of what constitutes excessive use depends on the specific state of the network at any given time, excessive use is determined by resource consumption relative to that of a typical individual user of the Mobile Broadband service and not by the use of any particular application.  <br>  <br>**4.0 How to Contact Us**  <br>A list of ways to contact NetZero is also available at [https://www.netzero.net/support/support.html](https://www.netzero.net/support/support.html)  <br>  <br><br>**© Copyright 2024NetZero, Inc. and NetZero Wireless, Inc.** |
