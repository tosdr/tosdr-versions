This policy describes how NetZero uses cookies and similar technologies on our websites and through our online services and how to contact us with any questions concerning this Policy.

By consenting to this Cookie Policy, you agree that we can distinguish you from other users of our website for the purposes set out below. This helps us to provide you with good user experience, tailored content and it also allows us to continually improve our website. For example, we can recognize and remember important information that will make it more comfortable for you to browse our website or use our apps such as preferred settings.

This Policy applies to any NetZero website or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.

What are cookies and similar technologies?

We may use, and may allow our Affiliates or third party partners to use, technological methods such as cookies or web beacons to collect information about you.

Cookies are small files that may be stored on your computer, mobile device, or other similar device and are used to make the Sites you visit easier to use and to improve effectiveness of advertising. For example, cookies keep track of your preferences, what Sites or other websites you visit, any personalization you may have done, any passwords you have elected to be remembered, and they may also measure whether you've seen or interacted with an advertisement on our Sites or other sites. Cookies (or similar technological methods) also allow us, our Affiliates and our third party partners to serve you with advertisements including targeted advertisements when you are on or off the Sites. Cookies may be set on your browser when you visit our Sites, or when you open emails from us.

Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movement of users. Web beacons help us and our third party partners better manage content delivery by informing us when you are on our Sites and what content is effective. We also use web beacons in our emails to let us know which emails you have opened.

The following describes how we use different categories of cookies and similar technologies and your options for managing the data collection settings of these technologies:

| Type of Cookie | Description | Managing Your Choices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Required | These cookies are essential for our functionality of the website and in particular they allow you to navigate the site, to sign in and to access secure areas of the website. | These cookies are required in order to operate our website and there is no option to delete these cookies. |
| Functional | Functional cookies may improve your experience on our site by speeding up your searches; recognizing you when you return to our site; remembering any personalization you may have done; and they may also measure whether you've seen or interacted with an advertisement on our Sites or other sites. We also use Google Analytics to measure web traffic and other parameters of your visit to our website. | You may choose to not allow cookies to be stored on your computer, mobile device, or other similar device by modifying your web browser settings. Each browser is different, so make sure to check each browser's user guide to learn how to change your cookie preferences for each browser. If you choose to reject cookies, however, you may not be able to automatically access products and services offered by us that require a user "login" or "sign in." In addition, any cookie-based opt-out tools may not be implemented on your device.<br><br>To opt out of Google Analytics, please go to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) for more information. |
| Targeted Advertising | We work with advertisers, agencies, and other companies that connect advertisers to the Internet (collectively, "Advertisers") in order to display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites. These advertisements are targeted based on information that we or third parties may have collected about you such as demographic information (gender, age, general geographic location, etc.) as well as behavioral information. Behavioral information is information about your preferences that is collected or inferred based on, among other things, online data such as the URLs or websites you visit and searches you perform, and offline data such as your purchases and subscriptions.<br><br>We and our Advertisers may use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize advertising content; for example, web beacons may enable us or our Advertisers to recognize your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email. In addition, a unique third party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email. | You may opt out of targeted advertising from many Advertisers by exercising your choice [here](https://www.netzero.net/start/landing.do?page=www/legal/opt-out). Please note that although you may opt out of targeted advertising, you may continue to see advertisements; these advertisements may not, however, be as relevant to you as targeted advertisements.<br><br>If you choose to opt out of receiving targeted advertising, please note that the opt-out tools accessed [here](https://www.netzero.net/start/landing.do?page=www/legal/opt-out) are specific to the browser and computer, mobile device or other similar device you are using at the time you opt out. Your opt-out choice cannot be honored if you access our Sites using a different browser on this computer, mobile device or other similar device, or if you access our Sites from a different device. Also, since the opt-out tools involve placing a special cookie on your browser, your opt-out choice cannot be honored if all cookies on your device(s) are deleted. As a result, you should repeat this opt-out process with each browser and device you use to access the Sites and Services and whenever cookies are deleted from your device(s). NetZero has no control over any opt-out tool offered by others and cannot guarantee the performance of such tools. |
