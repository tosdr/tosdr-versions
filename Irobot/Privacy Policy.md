[TABLE 1 – PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM DEVICES](#personal-devices)

[TABLE 2 – PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT THROUGH COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOG](#personal-cookies)

**1\. What’s in this policy?**
------------------------------

This policy tells you:

* what information we might collect about you,
* how we might use that information,
* when we might use your details to contact you,
* what information of yours we might share with others,
* your choices about the personal information you give us, and
* your rights as they relate to your personal information.

**What should I know before I start reading?**

Because this policy is lengthy and covers such a wide range of information, we suggest that you take a few moments to review the following terms:

* “iRobot”, “we”, “us”, etc. = iRobot Corporation
* “robots” = non-stationary iRobot consumer floorcare products
* “devices” = all iRobot consumer products, including but not limited to, all robots, Aeris Air Purifiers and Klaara Air Purifiers
* “Website” / “websites” = www.iRobot.com and all related pages and subdomains
* “app” / “apps” = iRobot’s mobile applications which provide support for devices, including the iRobot Home application and the Aeris Air application
* “Service” / “services” = our websites, robots and apps
* “you”, “your”, etc. = anyone who interacts with iRobot’s services
* “personal information” = data that can be linked to a specific individual
* “sensitive personal information” = non-public data about a specific individual, such as account login credentials or precise geolocation
* “deidentification” = a process used to remove the ability to link data back to an individual; this process is able to be reversed
* “anonymization” = a subcategory of de-identification whereby data can never be re-identified, or linked back to the individual
* “automated decision making” = the activity of using computer programs to automatically analyze or assess personal behaviors, habits, interests, or hobbies, or financial, health, credit, or other status, and then to make decisions based on the analysis of such information.

**2\. What does this policy cover?**
------------------------------------

This policy covers all iRobot and Aeris Air websites, mobile applications, services, and devices, with the exception of our educational robots.

iRobot Select and iRobot SmartCare subscription services data collections are governed by this policy with specific exceptions noted below. For more information about these services, please visit: [https://select.irobot.com/terms-of-service](https://select.irobot.com/terms-of-service).

These are commercial services run by iRobot. iRobot will generally be the controller of your information when you use these websites and apps.

It’s up to you to decide how much detail you want to know. We have explanation “pop ups” that appear when we ask you to input your personal information. As well as what’s in this Policy, a new feature or update might include a short privacy notice. In that privacy notice, you can find key information on what we do with your personal information when you use that service.

If you are looking for more detailed information about key metrics and digital governance and enforcement measures on iRobot’s services, iRobot publishes its annual Transparency Report in June. The link will be available here.

**What’s not covered in this policy?**

As stated in the previous section, our educational robots are not covered under this policy. 

* For privacy information related to iRobot’s educational robots, click here: [https://edu.irobot.com/privacy-policy](https://edu.irobot.com/privacy-policy)

Additionally, iRobot is not able to provide you with any information about third party privacy policies. Our services sometimes link to other companies’ services, like iRobot’s social media profiles on LinkedIn, Facebook, or Instagram, or you may be able to access our services from other places like third-party discount programs, e-commerce websites, etc. Those companies have their own privacy and cookies policies, so remember that the information you give them will follow their rules and not ours. Make sure to check their privacy policy so you know how they will use your information.

**3\. How do you protect my personal information?**
---------------------------------------------------

We’re strongly committed to keeping your information safe. And to do this we design our services with your data protection and privacy in mind. Our internal policies require us to separately store and restrict access to any personal information that can be easily linked back to you, like your full name and email address. We also have teams dedicated to looking after your information security and privacy.

One way that we protect your personal information is by deidentification or anonymization. We also encrypt personal information so only those authorized to access personal data are able to do so.

At the same time, no service can be completely secure – if you have any concerns that your iRobot account or personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please review this resource: [https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/15990](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/15990).

**Where we store your information**

iRobot stores personal information in a secure cloud environment, with strict access controls, data encryption at rest and in transit, and periodic audits to ensure access is only given to those who require it.

Some companies that provide services to us operate their services from locations outside where the data is collected. We only authorize these service providers and data transfers if they meet our security requirements. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be transferred to, stored, or processed in a location outside where the information was collected. The place where your information is processed may not have the same regulatory privacy protections as the place where it was collected.

**What happens if your information is compromised**

If the personal data we have collected from you is compromised, we will investigate the situation and notify you as required by applicable laws.

**4\. What types of personal information does iRobot collect about me?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ll give details about why we need your personal information and how we’ll use it before we collect it, unless it’s obvious.

**Information you provide**

When you make an order, create an iRobot or Aeris Air account, sign-up for offers or otherwise engage with our services, we may ask for certain personal information such as your name, email address, username and password, shipping address, billing information, and phone number.

Please note that by continuing to use iRobot’s services, you are acknowledging that iRobot cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you choose to post publicly on the internet, including on iRobot’s website or social media pages.

**Information on your activities when you talk to us**

We may ask for personal information when you call us, send us an email, or provide us with comments, chat messages and opinions on our websites or through our services.

**Information on your activities when you talk about us**

For example, if you “like” or “follow” our social media accounts, we’ll collect your handle.

**Information on your registered devices**

When you register your device, we collect information about your device, such as:

* identification number,
* serial number, and
* product code.

**Information we receive from third parties**

You may use third party social networks or authentication services, such as Facebook or Google, to login to our website or apps. These services may share your personal information with us, like your name and contact information.

The data we receive from these third-party services is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Service.

You may interact with a link to or from a third party, or a social media feature. If you follow a link to any of these websites, note that your interactions with these companies are governed by their privacy policy, not iRobot’s. We recommend that you review the policies and terms of use of any third party before you submit any information to those websites.

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their services or practices.

Please review your privacy settings on the applicable social media sites. Depending on your cookie/tracking settings, these social media sites may automatically record information about your browsing behavior every time you visit a site that has a social media button, regardless of whether you click on the button.

**Information we collect from registered devices equipped with smart technology**

Some of our devices are equipped with “smart technology”, which essentially means that they can wirelessly send us data. These devices include, but are not limited to:

* Roomba Combo j7+
* Roomba s9+
* Roomba j7+
* Roomba j7
* Roomba i3+ EVO
* Roomba i4
* Braava jet m6
* aair Lite Small Room Air Purifier
* aair 3-in-1 Pro Air Purifier

If you have one of these devices, we may collect information like:

* device and app usage data (specifically things like name, device number, battery life, mission information, device health and operations data),
* device replenishment data (specifically things like the need for new filters or other robot device parts),
* device environment data (specifically things like level of dirt, Wi-Fi name/credentials/signal strength, robot movement, floorplan and room names, existence and type of objects, floor type, other iRobot devices),
* partner app information (specifically the names of smart home partner apps you have downloaded).

This data is stored in a deidentified state (separated from identifiable information).

**Unless your device is enrolled in the iRobot Select program, it will NOT automatically transmit this information.** To be able to transmit, the device needs to be (1) registered online and (2) connected to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or the internet in some way. Apart from iRobot Select and iRobot SmartCare devices that require connections to operate, you can use our smart technology devices without

Wi-Fi or Bluetooth data transmission, simply by disconnecting your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from the device or by never connecting it at all. For more information on how to disconnect your device from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, please see the section below “[9\. What are my choices regarding my information?](#nine)”. ”.

Through the settings in your app, you may choose to not transmit map data to us; you may also choose to send images of obstacles to help improve our services.

You may also opt-in to connect your iRobot account with our smart home partners and you may opt-in or opt-out of sharing related information with us through the iRobot app.

**Information you share as a part of the iRobot BETA Program**

You may decide to be a part of the iRobot BETA Program which, when enabled by you on the app, allows you to use additional, experimental device and/or app functionality. By default, you are not enrolled in the BETA Program. If you would like to participate, you must manually opt-in within the iRobot app.

When available, some of the experimental features included in the BETA Program may require more data than the typical use of the iRobot services to work properly. To be sure that you are okay with sharing additional information, you will need to opt-in to each experimental feature separately prior to being able to use it.

The data required to support a BETA feature will be disclosed in the BETA Program section of the app at the time that the new BETA feature is released. You may choose not to participate with all or some of the BETA features. If you decide not to participate in a BETA feature, any data solely used to support that feature will not be collected.

Information collected as part of the BETA Program is subject to the same (or functionally similar) physical, administrative, and technological safeguards as other information collected under standard device use.

[TABLE 1 – PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM DEVICES](#personal-devices)

**5\. How long will iRobot keep my personal information?**
----------------------------------------------------------

When you give us any personal information, we only hold your information for as long as we need it to do the activities we told you about or if we have a valid reason to keep it. Some other criteria for holding on to your data include:

* whether we have a current or ongoing relationship with you and are actively providing a service,
* what type of information it is, the amount collected, how sensitive it might be and any legal requirements,
* whether the personal information has been deidentified,
* whether we have a legal or compliance obligation that we must comply with, or
* whether holding on to the data is advisable based on our legal position (in terms of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).

We may hold on to your data if it is first anonymized to be used for our records and/or for development purposes. If you would like your personal information to be deleted from our systems, please see the section below “[9\. What are my choices regarding my information?](#nine)”.

**6\. How can iRobot use my personal information?**
---------------------------------------------------

We must have a valid reason to use your personal information. It’s called the “lawful basis for processing”. Sometimes we might ask your permission to do things. Other times, when you’d reasonably expect us to use your personal information, we don’t ask your permission, but only when:

* the law says it’s fine to use it, and
* it fits with the data or privacy rights you have.

We use your information for these types of things:

1. to process and ship orders, returns or repairs,
2. to send you information about your orders,
3. to send you information about product sales, special offers and new site features,

1. This information will be sent according to your preferences which can be accessed either from your account on [https://www.irobot.com](https://www.irobot.com/) or in the app.

5. to operate and maintain features and functionalities of the devices and services we provide,
6. to deal with your requests, complaints and inquiries,
7. to detect and prevent fraud,
8. to diagnose and fix technology problems,
9. to improve our services and our device capabilities,
10. to enable iRobot to research and innovate,
11. to personalize your experience and our marketing communications,
12. to help us understand what kind of services you might use,
13. to recommend things we think might interest you,
14. to send you emails with news, offers and promotions,
15. to show you advertising on our services and to understand how effective it is,
16. to market our products and services to you on social media, and
17. to contact you about other issues, including password resets, relevant security notifications, and privacy updates.

**7\. When does iRobot share my personal information with others?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

iRobot will never sell your information. We may share your information with others in these ways:

**a. When you make something public**

Like post a comment which the public can see.

**b. When we use other companies to power our services**

In order for us to give you quality experiences and to understand how you’re using our services, we often use other companies to process your personal information on our behalf.

For example, for customer service, trouble-shooting robots, sending you emails about things we think might interest you, or analyzing data on how people use our digital services so we can improve them.

We work to ensure that your personal information is processed as if we were handling it directly. We carefully select these companies, only share with them what they need to do the work and we make sure they keep your information secure.

**c. When we share personal information with companies in our group**

Other companies owned by, or that are owned by the same company as iRobot, may access your data under the terms included in this Policy.

**d. When you use another company's service that connects to us, like voice-enabled devices and connected TV**

We allow third parties to create apps and tools that work with our devices and services, like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

If you want to connect a third-party app with our devices or services, we will let the third party collect information that is necessary to support the connection. However, iRobot does not control the data collection and use practices of these connected third parties. We recommend reviewing any third-party privacy notices before connecting.

You may opt-in or -out of a third-party app or service integration at any time through the app or by disabling your account directly with the third-party providers.

**e. When we share personal information with purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction**

We may share your personal information in connection with a transaction, like the sale of company assets or shares, or acquisition.

**f. When, by law, we have to pass on your information to other organizations**

We might also share your information if we have to by law, or when we need to protect you or other people from harm.

**g. When we have “anonymized” your data so that you cannot be identified.**

**8\. Can children use iRobot’s services?**
-------------------------------------------

We do not create content and services for anyone under 16, and we do not intentionally collect or maintain information from persons under 16.

If you become aware that personal information about a person under 16 has been provided to us, please immediately contact us at [dataprotectionofficer@irobot.com](mailto:dataprotectionofficer@irobot.com). That way, we can delete the information from our records.

**9\. What are my choices regarding my information?**
-----------------------------------------------------

You’re in control of your personal information. You have the right to:

* request a copy of your information,
* control device data collection,
* correct information that is wrong,
* ask us to delete your information or request that we only use it for certain purposes,
* change your mind and ask us to stop using your information, and

* For example, unsubscribing from any marketing emails or turning off personalization.

* opt out from personalized advertising cookies and other tracking.

**Requesting a copy of your information**

If you would like to submit a request for a copy of your information, please contact iRobot Customer Care. We require you to comply with a verification process to ensure that you are the owner of the data you are asking us to delete. If you have any questions or issues about your data subject rights, please contact [dataprotectionofficer@irobot.com](mailto:dataprotectionofficer@irobot.com).

**Controlling device data collection**

You may be able to control or stop the collection of certain usage data from your registered device, like when you opt-in or -out of certain features, through the “Account” and “Product Settings” pages in the app. For features that require you to opt-in before collecting device or usage data, opting out of the feature will immediately halt any future data collection related to that feature.

You may also control or stop the collection of usage data from your registered device by disconnecting your device from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth via the app.

* On the iRobot mobile app home page, you should follow this path to change your Wi-Fi connectivity: **Product Settings** > **Wi-Fi Settings** > **Change Product Wi-Fi** > **Go to phone settings**. In your phone’s settings, turn off iRobot’s access to local network, Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth.

If you decide to turn back on iRobot’s access to Wi-Fi, the app will automatically sync with the last known Wi-Fi network. If anything has changed about your Wi-Fi settings since your app was last connected, you will need to go back into the app to update that information.

Please contact [iRobot Customer Care](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/contact-support-info) if you have questions about disconnecting your device.

**Correcting information about you that is wrong**

You may correct information about yourself by logging into the website or the app. To make your corrections through the website, select the “My Account” page; to do so through the app, select the “Account” page.

If you have any questions or issues, please contact [iRobot Customer Care](https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/contact-support-info).

**Requesting the deletion of your information**

If you would like to submit a request for us to delete your information, you may do so in the app.

To submit a data deletion request via the app, you should follow this path: **Account** > **Your Name/Email** (top row of the page) > **Kebab Menu** (3 vertical dots at top right of page) > **‘Request to delete account’** > **‘Delete Account’**

If you have any questions or issues about your data subject rights, please contact [dataprotectionofficer@irobot.com](mailto:dataprotectionofficer@irobot.com).

**Controlling marketing communications**

You may control your communication preferences through the “My Account” page on our website or the “Account” page in the app. You may also click the “unsubscribe” button on any promotional email communication we send you.

Note that you may not be able to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, order confirmations, changes, or updates to features of the Service, or technical and security notices.

**Controlling personalized advertising cookies and other tracking**

You may be able to avoid the collection of information through some cookies or other tracking technologies by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to “[10\. How does iRobot use cookies and similar tracking?](#ten)” section below to learn about disabling or blocking cookies and tracking technologies.

**10\. How does iRobot use cookies and similar tracking?**
----------------------------------------------------------

**What are cookies and tracking technologies?**

Cookies are small text files which are transferred to your computer or mobile when you visit a website or app.

There are also similar pieces of tracking information we collect, like web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”).

**When does iRobot collect information this way?**

We may collect usage information when you visit our website or use our apps, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us.

iRobot complies with all applicable laws related to cookies and other tracking technologies.

**Why do we use cookies and other tracking?**

We use this information to do a few different things:

* to remember information about you, so you don’t have to give it to us again,
* to keep you signed in, even on different devices,
* to help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better,
* to deliver advertising,
* to help us personalize your use of iRobot’s services to you by remembering your preferences and settings,
* to find out if our emails have been read and if you find them useful.
