**Responsible gambling and our services**
-----------------------------------------

We take responsible gambling seriously and strive to provide an environment that puts the safety of players first. With this in mind, we have designed and implemented a variety of services to ensure that all players are gaming responsibly.

First, we provide comprehensive resources about problem gambling, including reliable facts and information on diagnosis, prevention, treatment options and other related issues. Our website also features a Responsible Gambling section with important information on how to keep gaming safe and enjoyable.

We also utilize industry-leading technologies which not only protect player accounts but also track their wagering behavior for warning signs of irresponsible or problematic play. This allows us to proactively intervene when necessary and inform players if their activity needs to be adjusted in order to remain responsible.  Additionally, our customer service representatives can answer questions about responsible gambling practices as well as help any customers who may express concerns over their own behavior regarding our services. 

Finally, we work hard behind the scenes with governments around the world in order to promote legislation which encourages responsible gambling practices by all members of society; this includes strict minimum age requirements as well as regular inspection procedures for all operators within any given jurisdiction.    It means that both players and operators alike can be held accountable for ensuring a safe playing environment where everyone has access to appropriate resources regarding problem gaming awareness and prevention—something which is deeply embedded into our core values.
