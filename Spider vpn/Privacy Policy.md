Spider VPN is committed to protecting your privacy. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don’t collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration.

Our guiding principle towards data collection is to only collect the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We designed our systems to not have sensitive data about our customers; even when compelled we cannot provide data that we do not possess.

General Information

These statistics never include anything about what the user did with the VPN: no data about the contents or destinations of VPN traffic, no DNS queries, and no IP addresses.

### (iii) (User-controlled option): Anonymous VPN connection diagnostics and crash reports

VPN connection diagnostics are anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual Spider VPN users. This feature is similar to a “send bug report” option. Users can specify in the settings menu of any Spider VPN App whether to send these data to us.

We require that you provide personal information, such as an email address and payment information, in order to establish an Spider VPN account, and so that we can email you, collect payments from you, and respond to support queries that you initiate.

Aggregate Apps and VPN Connection Summary Statistics
----------------------------------------------------

We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries. Therefore:

We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.

We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP addresses they used.

We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user’s computer.

Should anyone try to compel Spider VPN to release user information based on any of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data don’t exist.

In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, Spider VPN collects the following information related to your VPN usage:

### Apps and Apps versions

We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated. Knowing your current version of the Apps allows our customer support team to troubleshoot technical issues with you.

### Successful connection

We collect information about whether you have successfully established a VPN connection on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to which VPN location (but not your assigned outgoing IP address), and from which country/ISP (but not your source IP address). This minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our service, and to enable Spider VPN engineers to identify and fix network issues.

### Aggregate sum of data transferred (in MB)

We collect information regarding the total sum of data transfer you consume. Although we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a single user pushes more traffic than thousands of users combined, thereby affecting the quality of service for other Spider VPN users, we may contact them for an explanation.

Storing of Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Spider VPN keeps records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through our Site or Services, along with our response. Depending on how you contact Spider VPN, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us. Having full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best possible customer support experience.

Security Measures to Protect Your Information
---------------------------------------------

Spider VPN uses best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information. Access to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.

While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.

Servers are housed in data centres with strong security practices. None of these data centres centres require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN Services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.

Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers and manage to break their disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.
