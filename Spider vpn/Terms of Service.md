### Refund Policy

This Refund Policy forms an integral part of SpiderVPN’s Terms of Service and applies to all customers utilizing our services. Please read this policy carefully to understand your rights and obligations regarding refunds.

**30-Day Money Back Guarantee for New Customers:** SpiderVPN is pleased to offer a 30-day money back guarantee for new customers who decide to cancel their subscription within thirty (30) days of the initial purchase. Please note that this guarantee is applicable only to new customers and does not cover Dedicated IP services.

**Renewals and Refunds:** We would like to emphasize that refunds are not provided for subscription renewals. Once a subscription renewal has been processed, it becomes non-refundable. We strongly advise our valued customers to review their subscription status before the renewal date to ensure clarity.

**Rolling Subscription Nature:** All SpiderVPN subscriptions follow a rolling nature, meaning they continue until actively canceled by the customer. Cancellation requests must be initiated through the customer’s account dashboard. Mere submission of a support ticket requesting cancellation does not suffice to halt subscription payments.

**PayPal Subscriptions:** For customers using PayPal as a payment method, it is important to note that the responsibility of canceling the PayPal subscription rests with the customer. SpiderVPN does not have the ability to automatically cancel PayPal subscriptions. Any payments resulting from subscriptions not canceled by the customer will be considered final. We will adjust the customer’s due date based on these payments.

**Bitcoin Transactions:** Transactions made using Bitcoin introduce a unique element due to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. Refunds for Bitcoin transactions will be calculated based on the Bitcoin exchange rate to USD at the time of the refund disbursement, rather than the rate at the time of the initial transaction or refund request. Please note as for all other payment methods, we only offer refunds to new customers with the 30-days money back guarantee period not for subscription renewals

### Our Rights

SpiderVPN reserves the right to close your account at any given time without any prior notice. While SpiderVPN will, in the best interest of our clients, attempt to provide full and complete service, this right is reserved for reasons which may emerge at a later date.
