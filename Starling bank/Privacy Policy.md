Privacy Notice

Privacy Notice  
Version 3.1, Effective 13 July 2022  
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY VERY CAREFULLY

**SETTING THE SCENE**

At Starling, service is our no.1 priority. This includes respecting your privacy and protecting your information.

To make this notice easier to understand, we use some straightforward words throughout the notice and we then explain the meaning of those words at the bottom of this document - so if you need to check what one of these words means, scroll down to the bottom.

The notice describes how we collect and use your information and it covers all the ways you can interact with us... and there are lots of ways! For example: when you visit any of our websites, you use the App, you have an account with us, you get in touch with us, you apply for a job or you use a service that integrates with us.

**Please note that you do not have to transfer your information to us; however, if you do not, it will severely limit your ability to use our products and services - in particular, you will not be able to have a bank account with us.**

* Your rights;
* Other information that we need to give you or we think you will find useful;
* Meanings of some of the terms we use.

Each section has two parts:

2. * **If you want more detail** - this is a more comprehensive explanation of that section. Our websites and the App may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or other links or apps of our partner networks and our affiliates.

**4\. CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES, CREDIT SCORING AND FRAUD PREVENTION AGENCIES**

**In short**, we use credit reference and fraud prevention agencies for a number of matters including when you apply for an account with us and in relation to lending. Some of the ways we use them is through automated decision making but you can contact us if this happens and you want us to look at an application again.

**If you want more detail**:

* 4.1. We use credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies. For a detailed explanation of what they do and what they do with information about you, please refer to the following: [](https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain)[https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain](https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain), [](https://www.equifax.co.uk/crain/)[https://www.equifax.co.uk/crain/](https://www.equifax.co.uk/crain/) or [](https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/)[https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/](https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/). Where we share personal data about you with Cifas, it will process that personal data in accordance with its Fair Processing Notice, a copy of which can be found at: [](https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn)[https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn](https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn).
    
* 4.2. We use systems to make solely automated decisions in the following areas:
    
* 4.2.1. whether to give you an account or check a product or service is relevant for you;
    
* 4.2.2. detecting fraud or money-laundering and taking action (e.g. closing or freezing accounts);
    
* 4.2.3. additionally, if you apply for an overdraft or want to extend an overdraft, we use a credit scoring system. Please note the following:
    
* 4.2.3.1. this is an automated system which most lenders use to make fair and informed decisions on whether to lend money to certain people and how much. This helps us to lend responsibly. The credit scoring methods used are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased;
    
* 4.2.3.2. if you apply to borrow money, the system takes account of different information, including that of the credit reference agencies and the information we already hold about you. The system applies the information to look at your application and whether it is responsible to agree to lend to you.
    
* 4.3. If your application is declined via the system, you can still contact us if you want to have your application looked at again.
    
* 4.4. Ongoing reports may also be provided by credit reference or fraud agencies.
    

**5\. AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING**

* 5.1. Restricted automated decision making (including profiling) is when we use systems to make decisions solely by automated means without any human involvement - which then has a legal or similarly significant effect on you. This specific type of decision making has additional rules to protect you.
    
* 5.2. Here at Starling, except as set out in Section 4 above, we do not conduct such (restricted) automated decision making because any output from our automated decision making is checked by humans before a final decision is taken.
    

**6\. WHERE DO WE PROCESS AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION OR TRANSFER IT?**

**In short**, we generally process your information through servers in the UK and EEA and normally store it for six years. Sometimes the information goes outside the UK and EEA but we try and keep this to a minimum and we put safeguards in place as far as possible.

**If you want more detail**:

* 6.1. We process your information and store it on servers managed by our hosting providers.
    
* 6.2. Those servers are located across a number of secure data centres in the UK and EEA. Our server environment is highly secure and there is very limited personnel access. Any information will be encrypted at rest (in other words, on being stored).
    
* 6.3. We try to ensure that we do not send your information outside the UK and EEA. However, this is not possible in all cases:
    
* 6.3.1. in relation to a very small number of our suppliers, your information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the UK and EEA as well as processed by staff operating outside the UK and EEA who work for them. We will ensure that suitable safeguards are in place before your information is transferred outside the UK and EEA as required by law and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that information about you is treated securely and in accordance with this notice;
    
* 6.3.2. if you are outside the UK and EEA and make payments or send messages, or you are in the UK and EEA and make payments or send messages outside the UK and EEA, we may process payments through other institutions and payment systems. They may have to process and store information about you in connection with their own regulations; please note that the standards to which they adhere may not be as stringent as those in the UK and EEA.
    
* 6.4. Unfortunately, the transmission of your information via the Internet can never be 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of information about you transmitted to us and so any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
