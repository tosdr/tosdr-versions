Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not be considered a waiver of those rights. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

**Fair Use.**

All around the world, domestic laws limit strict copyright approaches. Many jurisdictions allow the use of protected copyrights for private, educational, news or commenting purposes.

Fair use is a concept behind the copyright law that allows the use of copyright without the permission of the copyright owner under specific circumstances. In different countries, different circumstances apply to fair use.

However, fair use cannot conflict with the normal use of the work or prejudice the author’s legitimate interests. If you are a citizen of the European Union you should be aware that each Member State provides a different interpretation of fair use, however, all of them provide a copyright protection exception to citation, criticism, review, use for caricature, parody or pastiche. More information on copyright protection in the European Union is available on the EUIPO website ([https://euipo.europa.eu/](https://euipo.europa.eu/)).

If you are a citizen of the United States fair use for criticism, research, education, commenting or news reporting might be considered as allowed. However, US Courts analyze potential fair uses according to the facts of each specific case.

In case of any doubt regarding fair use and permitted use of copyrights, it is strongly advised to seek legal advice. FreeYourMusic is not responsible for any action that may infringe on copyrights, including misunderstood fair use.

**Assignment of Receivable.**

The User or Visitor cannot make assignments or conveyance or transfer in any other way all or a part of rights, obligations, or receivables toward FreeYourMusic without the prior written consent of FreeYourMusic. Any attempt for such assignment or conveyance or transfer shall be null and void. FreeYourMusic may assign, convey or in any other way transfer rights and receivables that arise from or are connected with the Terms of Use without any prior consent of the User or Visitor.

**No Waiver Clause.**

The failure, nonperformance or nonenforcement of FreeYourMusic at any time for any period the provisions of or any rights deriving from the Terms of Use may not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or rights or the right of FreeYourMusic thereafter to enforce such provisions, and no waiver shall be binding unless executed in writing by FreeYourMusic.

For clarity, if we do not take any action immediately it does not mean that we are not entitled to do it later on.

**Force Majeure.**

FreeYourMusic shall be neither held liable or responsible to User nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached the Terms of Use for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of the Terms of Use to the extent, and for so long as, such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party including but not limited to fire, floods, embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any governmental authority or the other party.
