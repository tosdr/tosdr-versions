**Luggage and Seat Assignments:  Please check with your representative or the airline regarding bag fees and seat assignments as many airlines will charge for both seats and bag fees including long haul and domestic short haul flights.  In some cases, these extra fees can add up significantly, so it is important to understand all luggage and seat costs prior to payment of said air.**

ARTICLE: 6.7 Airport /Train station Transfers.  Transportation companies may have a maximum wait time for arriving or departing transfers. Clients may be billed for additional wait time from certain suppliers.   

**Delayed flights:**  It is the responsibility of the traveler to notify TGW of any flight delays or rebooking in case they are placed on another flights due to missed connections, weather delays etc. TGW will do its best to accommodate and send another driver /vehicle if needed but cannot guarantee availability for last minute changes and cannot reimburse clients for “no shows”.

**Clients must email a detailed and updated electronic ticket copy  to TGW with all information  at least 45 days prior to arrival so TGW can correctly book airport transfers ( TGW requires a copy of the itinerary as some cities may have more than one airport and or train station).  Airlines change and update their schedules quite a bit and clients are responsible for communicating correct flight/train information to TGW so  it can arrange transfers in a timely manner.  Transfers cannot be guaranteed and no refund will be provided for failure to provide correct flight/train information in a timely manner.** 

**ARTICLE: 6.8: Check in /out  Times:**  Check in times at most hotels/ private accommodation  are mid afternoon and check out times are generally noon.  Early check in and late check out requests must be pre-arranged ahead of time with hotels and generally incur fees from the properties.  Clients are advised to keep this in mind when booking flights.  

ARTICLE: 6.9:  Street Closures: Certain cities may have street closures  that may affect airport transportation and access to hotels  due to special events such as Carnival in Rio, Carnival in Salvador, Oktoberfest, The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, New Years in Rio and Cartagena, etc. TGW will do its best to accommodate all transportation in and out during these times. In some instances significant walking may be required or vehicle access may be unavailable for pickup at hotels due to street closures or last minute changes (whether announced or unannounced)  in road closures or access. In the event that TGW cannot provide transportation due to street closures or access, a refund of the airport transfer will be provided. 

**ARTICLE  7:  TRAVEL INSURANCE** Comprehensive travel insurance is highly recommended for all packages. Travel insurance should include coverage for health care/coverage while on your trip with us as well as medical evacuation, and trip cancellation.   Some countries may require that you be covered medically for COVID-19 or other illnesses  should you fall ill while on vacation. **Clients are responsible for purchasing insurance in a timely manner. Some coverages for insurance must be purchased anywhere from 7 to 21 days form the booking date of your first payment in order for them to be valid, and this can vary by provider and state/country of residence.**

**TGW may in its discretion recommend a company to you for purchasing of a policy but you are free to select any company of your choosing and encouraged to do your due diligence prior to purchasing a policy.** 

**We highly encourage all travelers to purchase coverage that includes “Cancel for any Reason” (CFAR), if available, which typically is an “add on” to normal policies. Clients are also advised to shop for travel insurance accordingly if they are going to partake in any sort of outdoor physical or high risk activity such as hiking, hang gliding or other activities as this coverage may also be an “add on” or not specifically covered by some insurance companies.**  It is the sole responsibility of the traveler to obtain adequate, timely and correct coverage for their package. TGW is not responsible for any changes to insurance requirements nor for any miscommunication regarding policy inclusions or exclusions as clients are encouraged to address these concerns directly with the insurance carrier PRIOR to purchasing of the policy.

**ARTICLE 8: REBOOKINGS:** If a client cannot make a trip and would like to rebook, he/she would be subject to the above referenced cancellation policies. Any net proceeds of the land package as well as a credit for the flights (if applicable) will be applied for a future vacation with TGW. Flights on a new vacation must be made on the same carrier and subject to the carrier’s rules, rates, class of service and availability.  All rebookings must be accepted in writing or via email before any changes can be made. Clients who must rebook their package voluntarily (when it is not cancelled by us) will be charged a $50 rebooking fee (per person). Clients are also responsible for any fare/hotel price differences (if any) when rebooking another vacation

**ARTICLE 9: PAYMENTS:**  TGW accepts Visa/Mastercard/ AMEX and Discover as well as PayPal. The company also accepts wire transfers. No personal checks or money orders are accepted. TGW does not accept third party credit card payments from persons not travelling on the package that they are paying

Clients will be refunded their full deposit provided no damage occurs and apartment is returned in good condition and no fines have been issued by the building for infraction of their rules.  TGW is not responsible in any way for non-refunded deposits due to damages or rule infractions caused by clients.  Although all properties generally document a “pre-arrival” checklist /report on the property condition and apartment’s contents, TGW highly encourages clients to inspect rental properties thoroughly for any damage or problems during the check in process. (2) The photos and descriptions of the apartments on our sites, emails, contracts and other communications may be slightly different than the actual apartments when clients check in. This is due to the nature of apartments themselves. Owners may paint the walls & ceilings, may add new utilities to it, or remove them, or things get broken and are not replaced/fixed yet, bed linen & towels used for photos may be different from these you will find in the apartment, furniture can be replaced/upgraded s, changed or slightly damaged since time of original booking, etc. TGW will in good faith update apartment descriptions on its website in a timely manner,  but cannot guarantee that apartments are 100% identical to pictures on our sites when arriving and is not liable for any apartment not being identical to any picture on its website or email communications.   (3)  If there are any problems with apartments or the building in general  (including but not limited to noise, problems with fixtures, air conditioning, plumbing, water, internet, cable, indoor outdoor pools/Jacuzzis, commons areas, elevators in building, etc.) it is the client’s responsibility to notify TGW or the apartment supplier directly in a timely manner  (within 24 hours of any incident) in WRITING or via email communication. **TGW will not be liable for any problems with apartments and will do its best to remedy any problems that may occur in good faith with our suppliers.  TGW will not be held liable for any failure of the client in notifying TGW  in a timely manner, or our suppliers of any problems nor for the apartment not living up to client expectations or for loss of enjoyment  or for things it cannot control or problems with  such things including, but not limited to,  utilities not working, power outages, internet outages, problems with common areas, pools, Jacuzzis, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical problems,  etc.).** Additionally TGW must be given 24 hours in order to remedy any situation.(4)  If a client abandons an apartment (leaves the apartment before the rental period terminates) TGW will not be responsible for providing a refund for any unused nights.

(8) Some apartments may have contracts/ short term leases to sign upon check-in with property-specific rules.  In the case where contracts/leases do exist clients must abide by these rules in order to check into the property.
