You may not download or otherwise export or re-export software from the Sites in violation of United States export controls.  
  
You agree that the Sites shall be deemed solely based in California, and that the Sites shall be deemed passive websites that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Sierra Club, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms & Conditions shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of the state of California, as they are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or relating to the Sites shall be barred permanently unless such claim or cause of action is brought within one year after it arises; any such claim or cause of action shall be brought only in the state or federal courts in the Northern District of California, and you consent to jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating such actions.  
  
Whenever possible, each provision of these terms shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision is deemed prohibited or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of these terms.  
  
This is the entire agreement between us relating to your use of the Sites and supersedes any prior understandings or agreements (written or oral). These terms may not be modified by you, in writing or otherwise, unless agreed to in a written document signed by the Sierra Club  
  
These Terms & Conditions, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be assigned by you, but may be assigned by Sierra Club without restriction.  
  
The Sierra Club has the right, in its sole judgment, to block access from a particular Internet address or to suspend or terminate a user's account for violations of these Terms & Conditions, including without limitation the right to terminate a user's account for repeat infringements of copyrighted material. In addition, Sierra Club reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of these Terms & Conditions.  
  
If you do not understand any of the foregoing Terms & Conditions or if you have any questions or comments, we invite you to contact our Digital Strategies Department by email at website.help@sierraclub.org or by phone at 414-977-5500.
