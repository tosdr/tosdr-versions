return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore,

ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well

as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the

importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is

protected.
