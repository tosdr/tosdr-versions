We mainly collect, store and process personal data at two different stages: (i) before you decide to register an account on our Websites and (ii) when you have registered an account on our Websites.

(i) Before you register an account on our Websites

When you visit our Websites, we collect information about your use of our Websites. This includes both information we collect directly from you, and information we collect about your behaviour. This information may constitute 'personal data' under applicable law. We use this information to provide you with (personal) offers, both on our Websites and via advertisements on other websites you visit.

These companies may collect, and use click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to our Websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you.

We use this personal data to process your purchase orders, for billing purposes, and to allow us to communicate with you about your purchase orders.

Overview of activities under stage (i) and (ii):

We may at each of the stages outlined above use your personal data but only when and to the extent the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

Where we need to perform the contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.

Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.

Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

Where you have provided your consent.

7. Sharing your data
    

We may share your personal data as follows:

1. Affiliates. We may share some or all of your personal data with our affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to comply with this Privacy Statement. In particular, you may let us share personal data with our affiliates where you wish to receive marketing communications from them.
    
2. Corporate Restructuring. We may share personal data when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.
    
3. Our Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your personal data with our third-party service providers who provide services such as payment processing, information technology and related infrastructure provision, business support (operational and administrative), customer service, the processing and delivery of marketing communications to you, email delivery, auditing and other similar services. These third parties are only permitted to use your personal data to the extent necessary to enable them to provide their services to us. They are required to follow our express instructions and to comply with appropriate security measures to protect your personal data. Third parties are subject to confidentiality obligations and may only use your personal data to perform the necessary functions and not for other purposes. 
    
4. Other Disclosures. We may share personal data as we believe necessary or appropriate: (a) to comply with applicable laws; (b) to comply with lawful requests and legal process, including to respond to requests from public and government authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (c) to enforce our Privacy Statement; and (d) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others.
    
5. Third Parties Designated by You. We may share your personal data with third parties where you have provided your consent to do so.
    

We do not share your data with any third parties outside of the above processing arrangements and we do not share your data with any business external to our group for their own marketing purposes.  From the data we collect, you should only ever receive marketing communications from our own brands.  

General information relevant for all requests and queries

Nothing in this Privacy Statement is intended to provide you with rights beyond or in addition to your rights as a data subject under applicable mandatory data protection law.

We will use reasonable endeavours to respond to your request or query within one month. We are entitled to extend this term by another two months if the complexity of the situation so requires. If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may either (i) charge you a fee, or (ii) refuse to process your request. With respect to access requests we may also charge you for extra copies. If we decide not to honour your request or answer your query, we will explain our reasons for doing so in our reply.

Protection and Storage of Data

We have used and will continue to use reasonable endeavours to protect your personal data against loss, alteration or any form of unlawful use. Where possible, your personal data will be encrypted and stored by means of state-of-the-art protection measures. A strictly limited amount of people have access to your personal data.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Our Sangoma Websites take precautions to protect our users' personal data. We use standard industry mechanisms to protect customer data from unauthorized access, for example, by using password protection and standard encryption methods. Transactions, access to transactional records, or access to account information occurs over a server that has safeguards such as secure server software (SSL) which encrypts information before transmission. You can confirm that pages are encrypted, and we urge you to do so before submitting or transmitting sensitive information, by viewing the lock icon on the bottom of most browsers. We also take measures off-line to protect your personal data that is known to us to be financial and business sensitive information to the same extent that we take measures to protect our own such information.

You may edit your account information and account profile at any time using your email address and password. Do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This may help to protect against access by others to your personal and business information if you share a computer or are using a computer in a public place.

Retention of Information

We will only retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement and your continued business relationship with  Sangoma or to the extent permitted by law. 

Should you choose to unsubscribe from our mailing list, please note that your personal data may still be retained on our database to the extent permitted by law

We use standard industry mechanisms to protect data from unauthorized access, for example, by using password protection and standard encryption methods. Transactions, access to transactional records, or access to account information occurs over a server that has safeguards such as secure server software (SSL) which encrypts information before transmission. You can confirm that pages are encrypted, and we urge you to do so before submitting or transmitting sensitive information, by viewing the lock icon on the bottom of most browsers. We also take measures off-line to protect your information that is known to us to be financial and business sensitive information to the same extent that we take measures to protect our own such information. 

In addition to the security measures detailed above, Sangoma takes the following steps to protect personal data: (i) takes measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of Sangoma processing systems and services; (ii) takes measures to ensure Sangoma’s ability to restore the availability of and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and (iii) has a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures. 

VI.  Your California Rights and Choices

Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests, to the extent Sangoma acts as a “business” (as opposed to a “service provider”) for purposes of handling personal information.  (To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.)

a. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Personal Information.

California residents may opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information. California law broadly defines what constitutes a “sale” – including in the definition making available a wide variety of information in exchange for “valuable consideration”. We do not, and will not, sell your personal information.

b. Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information

You may also request that we delete any personal information that we have collected directly from you (note that this is different from your right to “opt-out” of us selling your personal information, which is described above). However, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.  If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to apply for employment at Sangoma.

c. Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information

California residents also have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information we collect, use, or sell.  As a California resident, you may request access to the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you.

California residents may learn more how to exercise these rights of information access by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.voipsupply.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by mail sent to Sangoma US Inc., Attn: Legal, 445 Jan Davis Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806. We will only use the information you submit to respond to your request, and we may need to identify you and your state of residence before we can respond.

However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information, or where we cannot verify your identity in relation to such personal information. Thus, for security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – partly by requesting certain information from you – when you request to exercise certain of your California privacy rights.

Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:

* Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.
    
* Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern by doing so.
    

If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you with additional information about the reasons why we could not comply with your request.

d. Right to Nondiscrimination. We do not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.

e. Information About Persons Under 16 Years of Age

We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age in California unless we have received legal consent to do so. If we learn that personal information from such California residents has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to remove their information from our database (or to obtain legally required consent).

f. Authorized Agents

You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above. We will take steps to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf by providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.

g. Disclosure of Personal Information, No Sale

Over the preceding twelve (12) months, we disclosed certain categories of California residents’ personal information to the categories of third parties as shown in the table above. We do not and will not sell California residents’ personal information.

We may retain the content of any customer service web form or email that we receive, the email from which it is sent, and our response, if any. Content and other information related to emails sent by user to us may be used as testimonials or for any other marketing purpose, except that no marketing communications unrelated to the subject matter of the submission will be sent to the email address from which such email or form is sent unless the user specifically elects to receive additional marketing materials or we obtain the email address through another avenue that permits such use. In all cases, email addresses may be compared to subscription or customer lists of ours and our business partners.

Where completion of a sale or shipment requires the use of information, such as credit card information, shipping addresses, or contact persons, we may use the information to the extent necessary.

Transactions, access to transactional records, or access to account information occurs over a server that has safeguards such as secure server software (SSL) which encrypts information before transmission. You can confirm that pages are encrypted, and we urge you to do so before submitting or transmitting sensitive information, by viewing the lock icon on the bottom of most browsers. We also take measures off-line to protect your personal data that is known to us to be financial and business sensitive information to the same extent that we take measures to protect our own such information.

You may edit your account information and account profile at any time using your email address and password. Do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This may help to protect against access by others to your personal and business information if you share a computer or are using a computer in a public place.

Retention of Information

We will only retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement and your continued business relationship with the Sangoma United States Group or to the extent permitted by law. 

Should you choose to unsubscribe from our mailing list, please note that your personal data may still be retained on our database to the extent permitted by law.

3. For EU Individuals: Your Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    

In addition to the above, the Sangoma United States Group also processes personal information in compliance with the GDPR.

For the purpose of applicable data protection legislation, the data controller of your personal data is the Sangoma United States Group company that is providing the individual website or other services.  All members of the Sangoma United States Group may be contacted at the following address: Sangoma Technologies Inc., the operating subsidiary of Sangoma Technologies Corporation, with its main address at 100 Renfrew Drive, Suite 100, Markham, Ontario, L3R 9R6.

4. Legal Basis for the Processing of your Information 
    

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the Sangoma United States Group’s processing of your personal information will also be based on the following: To the extent that the Sangoma United States Group obtains your consent for the processing of your personal information such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). If the processing of your personal information is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and the Sangoma United States Group or for taking pre-contractual steps upon your request, such processing will be based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (b). Where the processing is necessary for the Sangoma United States  Group to comply with a legal obligation, the Sangoma United States Group will process your personal information on basis of GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (c), and where the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, such processing will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (f).

Please note that where you have given your consent to the processing of your personal information you may withdraw your consent at any time, for example by contacting the Sangoma  United States Group as detailed below which withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of any processing previously made on basis of your consent. 

5. Your Rights  
    We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete, and up to date. You have the right to access, correct, or delete the personal information that the Sangoma United States Group collects. You are also entitled to restrict or object, at any time, to the further processing of your personal information. You may have the right to receive your personal information that you provided to the Sangoma United States Group in a structured and standard format and, where technically feasible, the right to have your personal information transmitted directly to a third party.  You may lodge a complaint regarding the processing of your personal information with the competent [EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs)](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). 
    

You may contact the Sangoma United States Group as detailed below to exercise your rights. We will respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe. To protect the privacy and the security of your personal information, the Sangoma United States Group may request information from you to enable the Sangoma Group to confirm your identity and right to access such information, as well as to search for and provide you with the personal information we maintain. There are instances where applicable laws or regulatory requirements allow or require the Sangoma United States Group to refuse to provide or delete some or all of the personal information that the Sangoma United States Group maintains.

We provide the following rights to all EU and Swiss individuals:

1. Right to revoke consent
    

If we process personal data on the basis of your consent, you have the legal right to revoke such consent at any time. We will then cease the relevant processing activity going forward (which may include discontinuation of services and/or processing future orders).

2. Right of access to your information 
    

If you want to know what personal data we have collected or process about you, you may request us to provide a copy of your personal data by contacting us as defined below.  We will ask you to identify yourself. We will not provide you with a copy of your personal data to the extent that the rights and freedoms of others are or may be adversely affected.

3. Right to rectification and erasure of data, and restriction of processing
    

If you believe that our processing of your personal data is incorrect, inaccurate, unlawful, excessive, incomplete, no longer relevant, or if you think that your data is stored longer than necessary, you may ask us to change or remove such personal data or restrict such processing activity, by contacting us as defined herein. 

4. Right to data portability
    

You have the right to receive your personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, in accordance with Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation, by contacting us as defined below.

5. Right to object 
    

You have the legal right to object, on grounds relating to your particular personal situation, at any time to processing of your personal data.  Furthermore, you have the right to object at any time to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or to profiling. You can do this by either updating your preferences for your account on our Sangoma United States Group Websites.

For the sake of clarity: without prejudice to the foregoing we are at all times entitled to send you messages that do not constitute direct marketing, i.e. service messages as it relates to your business relationship with the Sangoma United States Group.

6. Additional Data Security  
    In addition to the security measures detailed above, the Sangoma United States Group takes the following steps to protect personal data: (i) takes measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of the Sangoma United States Group’s processing systems and services; (ii) takes measures to ensure the Sangoma United States Group’s ability to restore the availability of and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and (iii) has a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures. 
    

General information relevant for all EU and Swiss Individuals

Nothing in this Privacy Statement is intended to provide you with rights beyond or in addition to your rights as a data subject under applicable mandatory data protection law. We will use reasonable endeavors to respond to your request or query within one month. We are entitled to extend this term by another two months if the complexity of the situation so requires. If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may either (i) charge you a fee, or (ii) refuse to process your request. With respect to access requests we may also charge you for extra copies. If we decide not to honor your request or answer your query, we will explain our reasons for doing so in our reply.

Right to withdraw consent

Insofar as we process data on the basis of a consent given by you, you have the right to revoke the consent given at any time by filling out the form on [https://www.sangoma.com/legal/web-requests/](https://www.sangoma.com/legal/web-requests/) . The revocation of your consent does not mean that the data processing carried out based on your consent up to the time of revocation becomes invalid.

Contact Information for GDPR or Privacy Statement questions or concerns

If you contact us, we will use the personal data that you voluntarily provide to us for the sole purpose of contacting you and processing your enquiry. In order to answer your request, it may be necessary to forward it together with your personal data to one of our affiliated companies. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c) GDPR and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.

If you have a question or a complaint about this privacy policy as pertains to personal data under the GDPR or our Privacy Statement or the way your personal data is processed by the Sangoma United States Group under the GDPR or our Privacy Statement please contact us via the following [https://www.sangoma.com/legal/web-requests/](https://www.sangoma.com/legal/web-requests/)
