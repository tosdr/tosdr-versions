Your Rights and Choices

California, Virginia, and other applicable U.S. State laws may grant you certain rights—subject to all applicable limitations, exemptions, or exceptions—regarding our collection and use of your personal information. These rights include, to the extent applicable and to the extent granted under applicable law:

* The right to confirm whether personal information about you is processed and to access such personal information;
* The right to request the disclosures of (1) what personal information has been collected; (2) the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; (3) the business or commercial purpose for collection or selling personal information; (4) the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information; and (5) the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, also called data portability;

When exercising your right to deletion (to the extent applicable), please identify the information that you wish to be deleted and whether you would like to delete your account. Please note that the exercising of your right to deletion will result in the deletion of the personal information that we have collected about you. This may result in our inability to further provide services to you in the future.

**Exercising Your Rights.** To exercise the rights described above only to the extent applicable law grants you such rights, please submit a verifiable consumer request to:

Email us: [\[email protected\]](https://purchase.growtix.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Only you or a registered agent (if and only as permitted under applicable law) that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. If you have a registered agent act on your behalf, we have the right to authenticate such agent’s authority to act. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format. Your request will be responded to within 45 days, and in any event, we will respond to you within the timeframe required under applicable law. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

If we deny your request, you can appeal such denial by [\[email protected\]](https://purchase.growtix.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
