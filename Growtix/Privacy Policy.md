For example, a browser may allow you to reject cookies from certain websites, reject certain types of cookies regardless of the website, reject or disable all cookies from all websites, and/or delete previously stored cookies. Some browsers also give you the option of being notified every time a cookie is sent to your browser by a website. You can disable or limit cookies but doing so may impact your use and enjoyment of the Services and other websites. For example, the Services may not be able to be personalized for you, may no longer capture or remember your preferences or other choices you have made on the Services in the past, and may not remember your name or contact information or other information you have entered using the Services, and our website may not recognize the device(s) you use to access the Services.

Changing your cookie preferences in one browser will not necessarily carry over to other browsers, so you may need to adjust your preferences each time you get a new device, install a new browser, upgrade an existing browser, or alter or delete a browser’s cookie file.

The Services may also use the following types of tracking technologies: web beacons (also called clear GIFs), flash cookies, and pixels (also called pixel tags). Web beacons are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that function similar to how cookies function but, in contrast to cookies, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. Flash cookies collect and store information about your use of a website and are commonly used for advertisements and videos. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove and cannot be used to manage Flash cookies. Click here for information on how to manage Flash cookies. Pixel tags can be placed on websites or within emails to track your interactions with those websites and when emails are opened.

**How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Signals.** Due to the automatic collection of data using cookies as described above, we do not honor “do not track” requests. For this reason, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of information using cookies and tracking technologies.

However, residents of certain U.S. states may opt out by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal under applicable law, including the Global Privacy Control (GPC), depending on which browsers and/or browser extensions you use that may support such a signal. To look at extensions and browsers supporting the GPC browser signal, visit here: [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/). Note that if you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.

**Embedded Content.** The Services may incorporate content, including feeds, scripts embedded in the Services’ code, and visible content (e.g., videos), provided by third parties. In some cases, those third parties collect data about how you interact with their content.

**Information that We Obtain from Third-Party Sources.** We may obtain data about users of the Services from various third-party companies and public sources, whether offline or online (e.g., marketing companies, analytics consultants, publicly available social media profiles, other public sources of information), and we may combine that data with Collected Information. This enhances our existing information about our users and customers and improves our ability to contact you and our marketing’s relevancy.

### 4\. Retention of Personal Information

We will retain your personal information for as long as it’s needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (e.g., tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it; if that is not possible (e.g., because your personal information has been stored in back-up archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

#### 5\. Automated Processing

Other than as may be described in this Privacy Policy, you will not be subject to decisions based on automated information processing without your prior consent.

#### 6\. International Transfers of Personal Information; Data Privacy Framework

Due to the fact that Company’s business is international, your personal information and other Collected Information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in any country where our or our suppliers’ servers, databases, or facilities are located or operated. By accessing, receiving, or using the Services or by providing consent to us (where consent is required by applicable law), you specifically acknowledge and agree that information will be transferred outside of the country from which you access the Services (including, for example, to the United States, Canada, and Australia) and that such countries’ data protection and related laws, regulations, and rules may be different than, and may not be as protective as, those of the jurisdiction from where you access the Services. Your use of or access to the Services constitutes your consent to such transfers.

Additionally, where required by applicable law, we have ensured that your personal information included in such transfers is adequately protected through the use of contractual clauses or other adequate measures allowed or required under such applicable laws for example, by signing relevant EU standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission (the form for these clauses can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)). Subject to applicable law, you have the right to obtain details about the mechanism under which your personal information is transferred cross-border. For more information about these transfer mechanisms, please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section below.

We comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) under the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

We are responsible for the processing of personal data we receive, under the DPF, and subsequently, we are responsible for personal data we transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We comply with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and the UK, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over our compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, we commit to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request for more information or to file a complaint. These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.

For complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. To learn more about this option, visit the DPF’s "[How to Submit a Complaint](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/)" page. Please note that the foregoing processes apply only to the resolution of disputes regarding personal information received by us under the DPF. All other disputes that you may have with us must be resolved in accordance with the terms and conditions of any applicable websites, mobile apps, email newsletters, email subscriptions or other digital properties owned or controlled by the Company.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

We will respond to your request within the applicable timeframe required under applicable law. If we deny your request, you can appeal such denial by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://purchase.growtix.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

#### 12\. Accuracy & Information Security

Personal information you provide to us should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up to date.

We have implemented reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, physical, and organizational security measures designed to help protect against the unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss, theft, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. This includes implementing measures designed to limit access of employees to, and the use of, your personal information. We do not publish all of our security measures online because this may reduce the effectiveness of our security measures. We educate our employees with respect to their obligations to protect your Collected Information. However, Company does not and cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss, theft, misuse, and alteration of information will not occur. The storage and communication of information can never be completely secure.
