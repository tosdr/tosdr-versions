### 3\. Satisfaction Policies

We provide the ticketing software used to process ticket sales and admissions for the events listed on this website, including streamed events. We are not responsible for the production, experience or cancellation of events listed on our website. If you are unsatisfied with your experience with an event listed on the Leap Conventions website, you must speak to a valid representative of the event promoter or venue.

### 4\. Leap Conventions as a Content Provider

Leap Conventions is not responsible for any content posted or displayed on any page within the Leap Conventions website by our users (including event promoters). Such information does not represent the viewpoints or opinions of our company. Leap Conventions cannot be held responsible for any agreements, contracts, unfulfilled promises or any communication made between an event promoter and a third party. Leap Conventions is not responsible for any illegal or unlawful material — including defamatory, indecent, pornographic, obscene, otherwise objectionable or harmful, or copyrighted material — posted to an event page by an event promoter on our website or otherwise provided by users to, through, or using this website.

### 5\. Events and Ticketing

**Accuracy of Information:** Users of any of Leap Conventions services certify that any information provided to us is complete and accurate. If we are unable to validate the billing information you provide to us, we reserve the right to cancel your tickets or prohibit you from using this website.

**Ticket Purchasing:** Purchases of tickets made through the website must be made by credit or debit card. If the credit or debit card information that you submit is incorrect or invalid, your payment will not be processed. We have no responsibility or liability if your credit or debit card is declined by your financial institution. Payments are processed by our third-party payment processor.

**Fees:** Non-refundable service fees may be added to each ticket and/or order. By purchasing tickets from Leap Conventions, you agree to pay these fees and understand that the fees will not be refunded under any circumstances. The customer is responsible for any carrier fees associated with mobile ticket delivery.

**Ticket Limits:** In order to discourage unfair ticket purchase practices, event promoters may set maximum limits for the number of tickets purchased per person. Leap Conventions is not responsible for these limits, nor are we able to circumvent them in any way. Any attempted or actual circumvention of these limits by a customer will result in the termination, without compensation or liability to you, of any further use of any Leap Conventions services and the nullification of any tickets purchased.

**Unlawful Ticket Reselling:** Leap Conventions in no way condones the unlawful resale of tickets. Any unlawful attempt to resell tickets purchased through Leap Conventions will result in Leap Conventions terminating those tickets without compensation or liability to you, as well as the customer being barred indefinitely from use of any Leap Conventions services.

**Postponed Events:** If an event is postponed to a later date, it is the event promoter’s responsibility to update the listing and notify Leap Conventions. In such a case, the event’s promoter is required to accept outdated tickets at the door for entrance into the event. For tickets distributed electronically, the event’s promoter shall be responsible for updating electronic tickets to reflect the postponement of the event.

**Alteration of Event Listings:** Leap Conventions reserves the right to expunge any event from the Leap Conventions website at any time, under any circumstances, and for any reason.

### 6\. Disclaimer of Warranties

This website, including the Materials on this website, is provided "as is" and “as available,” without any warranties of any kind. Leap Conventions makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all warranties, including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights, title, and compatibility with any standards or user requirements, as well as any arising by operation of law or from a course of dealing or usage in trade. Leap Conventions has no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, misdelivery, or failure to store any content or user communication. further, Leap Conventions does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the Materials on its Internet website or otherwise relating to such Materials or on any websites linked to this website, and Leap Conventions does not warrant or guarantee that the website will be uninterrupted or error free, that any defects will be corrected, or that the website is free of viruses or other harmful conditions or components.

### 7\. Limitations of Liability

In no event shall Leap Conventions its affiliates, and their respective licensors and suppliers (collectively, the Leap Conventions Parties”) be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the Materials on Leap Conventions's website, even if Leap Conventions or a Leap Conventions authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES’ LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED $50, EVEN IF THIS REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### 8\. Indemnity for Third-Party Actions

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST (I) ALL CLAIMS, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, LAWSUITS AND LEGAL ACTIONS BROUGHT BY ANY THIRD PARTY AGAINST ANY OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO (A) YOUR USE OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES OFFERED BY LEAP CONVENTIONS; (B) YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS; (C) ANY CONTENT OR FEEDBACK YOU PROVIDE; (D) YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR THE RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY; OR (E) ANY ALLEGATION THAT THE CONTENT YOU PROVIDE OR DATA OR INFORMATION YOU INPUT INTO THE LEAP CONVENTIONS WEBSITE INFRINGES, MISAPPROPRIATES, OR VIOLATES THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY (COLLECTIVELY, “THIRD-PARTY ACTIONS”); AND (II) ANY AND ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, SETTLEMENTS, JUDGMENTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING PAYMENT OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES’ ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS) INCURRED BY ANY OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES, ASSESSED OR FOUND AGAINST ANY OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES, OR MADE BY ANY OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES, RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM ANY SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACTION (COLLECTIVELY, “THIRD PARTY RELATED LOSSES”).

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS TO THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES APPLY EVEN IF SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACTION AND THIRD PARTY RELATED LOSSES ARISE FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND OR DEGREE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, OR OTHER FAULT OR WRONGDOING OF ANY OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES.

HOWEVER, NOTHING CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO REQUIRE ANY INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD RENDER OR MAKE THIS CLAUSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, VOID AND/OR UNENFORCEABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. FURTHER, YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY WILLFUL, WANTON, INTENTIONAL OR RECKLESS MISCONDUCT OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS PARTIES IN THOSE STATES THAT DO NOT PERMIT INDEMNIFICATION FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.

“THIRD PARTY” INCLUDES, AMONG OTHERS, OTHER USERS OF THE LEAP CONVENTIONS WEBSITE, YOUR SPOUSE, PARTNER, FAMILY MEMBERS, GUESTS, NEIGHBORS, ROOMMATES, TENANTS, AND EMPLOYEES, AND ANY INSURANCE COMPANY.

Leap Conventions reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Leap Conventions and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims. You agree not to settle any such claim without Leap Conventions prior written consent.

### 9\. Revisions and Errata

If you violate any of the terms herein, Leap Conventions reserves the right to terminate your account, bar you from using any Leap Conventions services, cancel any ticket orders and take appropriate legal action, in each case without compensation or liability to you.

### 12\. Refund Policies

Leap Conventions is unable to offer refunds after an event ticket has been purchased; however, a refund may be issued when an event is canceled. If an event is canceled, a refund in the amount of the face value of the ticket will be issued to customers who purchased tickets. Service, delivery and transaction fees will not be refunded.

The event promoter will have control over any refund availability and duration. You understand and acknowledge that Leap Conventions cannot, and has no obligation to, issue refunds unless and until Leap Conventions actually receives all such corresponding funds from the applicable event promoter.

The version of these Terms in effect at the time an event ticket is purchased will govern that transaction.
