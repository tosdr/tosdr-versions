We do not sell your personal information for money.

However, our practices may vary for different jurisdictions and by Service.

On relevant online Services, Movies! offers choices to opt-out of sharing for targeted advertising that can be accessed via the Service, such as through the footer of relevant websites, as described further below. Movies! honors these choices for residents of jurisdictions in which consumers have a right to opt-out of sale or sharing. We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16 without consent.

YOUR CHOICES
------------

* **Opt-Out of Promotional Email:** To opt out of future promotional email messages from us, you can opt-out based on the instructions provided in the promotional message that was sent to you, or send an opt-out request to us at [\[email protected\]](https://moviestvnetwork.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
* **Opt-Out of Cookies:** As noted above, some of our websites and other online Services may use standard analytics and advertising tools to serve you targeted advertising.

--------------------------------------------------
