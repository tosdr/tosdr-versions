Users can visit our sites without revealing any information about themselves. If a visitor chooses to give us personal information via the internet for the purposes of correspondence, processing a gift, or providing a subscription to a publication, then it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information.

If users tell us that they do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact, we will respect their wishes. If users wish to review or correct the personal information we’ve collected, they can do so by contacting us at info@unitedwayri.org. We also keep track of the domains from which people visit, analyzing this data for trends, insights, and statistics. Afterward, we discard it.

Certain sections of our website use “cookies” to store user information. A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Currently, websites use cookies to enhance the user’s visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user’s ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections in a “shopping cart.” Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our sites so we can make the user experience even better.

Cookies were originally designed to help a website distinguish a user’s browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. If you are just browsing United Way of Rhode Island’s website, a cookie identifies only your browser. If you become a registered user on a United Way of Rhode Island website (with a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information that we believe will be of value to you based on preferences you have indicated while visiting the site. It is possible to set your browser to inform you when a cookie is being placed—this way, you have the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. If you are just browsing our site and are not a registered user, you do not have to accept a cookie and you can still continue browsing the site. However, if you are visiting a site where you will be accessing a confidential account, you must accept that site’s cookies because they are essential for site administration and security.
