You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and password, for restricting access to your computer, and for all other activities that occur (whether you authorize such activity or not) under your Account (except to the extent that such activity occurs because someone gains access to our system without using your identifiers or password). At no time should you respond to an online request for a password other than in connection with the log-in process to the Service. Your disclosure of your password to any other person is at your own risk. You will immediately notify us of the unauthorized use of your Account, Wallet (defined below), password, username, or any other breach of security related to the Service.

By connecting your Wallet, you promise that you are the exclusive owner and controller of the Wallet. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any financial information in, and the security of your Wallet. Additional Terms regarding blockchain-based content apply whenever you connect your Wallet, interact with, or transact in NFTs.

4.        BILLING

A.        If you choose to use paid aspects of the Service, you agree to these Terms and any additional terms or policies disclosed at the point of purchase.

Certain aspects of the Service are provided for a fee or other charge by Manticore or an applicable third-party contracted by Manticore to provide payment services (a “Payment Service Provider”). Such Payment Service Providers may include blockchain hosted or un-hosted wallet providers and third-party online marketplace digital asset payment facilitators. Should you elect to use paid aspects of the Service, you agree to the pricing, payment, and billing policies related to such fees and charges, plus other taxes as applicable, as posted through the Service, its related applications, or by an applicable Payment Service Provider. Upon your acceptance of these Terms and submission of your order, you hereby agree that Manticore or an applicable Payment Service Provider (collectively, for purposes of this section, “we”) have the right to automatically charge your credit card or debit your account or other payment method for the applicable fees or charges, plus any applicable taxes that we are required to collect, and you authorize us to do so. Thereafter, if you have purchased or redeemed a subscription-based product or service, each time your subscription comes up for renewal, we have the right to charge your credit card or debit your account the then-current renewal rate plus any applicable taxes that we are required to collect, and you authorize us to do so. Any prices posted in US Dollar or non-US Dollar currencies by Manticore on the Service do not include any applicable sales tax, unless specifically noted that it is tax inclusive.

You are responsible for paying certain fees involving NFTs and digital assets whenever you interact with the blockchain, including “gas” fees, as well as all other fees reflected on the Website. The value of the gas fee may change, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of Manticore’s control. Although we attempt to provide accurate gas fee information, this information reflects our estimates of the gas fees, which may vary from the actual fees you pay to use the Service and interact with the blockchain. You acknowledge that under no circumstances will a transaction be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the gas fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a User. You also acknowledge and agree that the gas fee is non-refundable under all circumstances.

Manticore reserves the right, upon reasonable notice, to (directly or through an applicable Payment Service Provider): (i) charge for access to some or all of the Service, charge for access to premium functionality or Content on some or all of the Service or Website(s), require a free or paid subscription (“Usage Subscription”), or account registration to access some or all of the Service, (ii) change terms and conditions for the Service or portions thereof, and (iii) restrict access to the Service or portions thereof, in whole or in part, based on any lawful eligibility requirements Manticore may elect to impose (e.g. geographic or demographic limitations). You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining, at your sole cost, all internet devices and other equipment and software, and services necessary for you to access and use the Service.

You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure payment in advance for all paid aspects of the Service, and to ensure that your credit or debit cards or other payment instruments accepted by Manticore or an applicable Payment Service Provider continue to be valid and sufficient for such purposes. Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Manticore, we may exercise our termination rights (as detailed below) in the event of any payment delinquency. Manticore further reserves the right to terminate Usage Subscriptions for cause immediately in our sole discretion without advance notice or liability. In such an event, you will not be entitled to a pro-rata refund or credit.

B.        Manticore has no obligation to provide refunds for any amounts paid for the Service.

Except as set forth in any Additional Terms, purchases of Content (including but not limited to Usage Subscriptions) are final, non-refundable, have no monetary value (i.e. are not a cash account or equivalent) and are purchases of only a limited, revocable, personal, and non-transferable license to use such Content through the Service, even if such purchases come with a durational term (for instance, a monthly subscription). Notwithstanding any agreement by Manticore to provide a discretionary pro-rata refund or credit in certain circumstances, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, economic, or monetary interest in your Account, Core Content or User Content, Usage Subscriptions or other virtual goods and services, which remain the exclusive property of Manticore (subject only to the limited User Content License set forth below, this Agreement, or any Additional Terms).

5.        CONTENT LICENSES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

A.        Manticore owns Intellectual Property Rights in the Service and the Manticore Marks.

Manticore owns all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, publicity rights, database rights, patent rights, and other intellectual property rights or proprietary rights recognized by law  (“Intellectual Property Rights”) in and to the Service, including but not limited to the Content, Software, Servers, and Websites related thereto, and in and to our trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, taglines, and trade dress (collectively, the “Manticore Marks”). You acknowledge and agree that Manticore and its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein, other than with respect to the User Content.

You understand and agree that without a written license agreement with Manticore, we do not authorize you to make any use of the Manticore Marks, including but not limited to “Manticore” or “Core”. Use of the Manticore Marks in whole or in part is subject to the guidelines and terms of any applicable license provided in our [Branding Guidelines](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.coregames.com/creator_kit/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1654543210995657&usg=AOvVaw1b_FxdrciIVLHt5nQk3wyD).

Except as expressly granted in this Agreement, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, and in and to the Manticore Marks, are reserved by Manticore. Copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries protect the Service and the Manticore Marks.

B.        Manticore grants you certain licenses to access and use the Service under these Terms.

Unless otherwise expressly stated in writing by Manticore, by agreeing to these Terms you are granted a limited, non-sublicensable license (i.e. a personal and limited right) to access and use the Service for your personal or internal business use solely as permitted through the normal functionality of the Service (the “Core Content License”). To be clear, you may not use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display or perform any Core Content, whether modified by you or not, outside the virtual environment of the Service except as expressly agreed upon in a written agreement by Manticore or through any Additional Terms or other written policy of Manticore. You acknowledge that when you receive a Core Content License you do not acquire ownership of any copies of the Content, or transfer of any copyright or other Intellectual Property Rights in the Content. This Core Content License is expressly conditioned upon you and each of your Accounts remaining active, in good standing, and in compliance with these Terms.

Manticore reserves the right, but is not obligated, to use technological measures designed to prohibit the copying, transfer, or distribution of Core Content outside the Service when we in good faith believe that such copying, transfer, or distribution would or might violate the Intellectual Property Rights of our Users, Manticore, or third parties.

You may not charge any third party for using the Software, the Service or any related materials thereto, and you may not modify, adapt, reverse engineer (except as otherwise permitted by applicable law notwithstanding such limitation), decompile, or attempt to discover the source code of the Software, or create any derivative works of the Software, or otherwise use the Software except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

C.        You retain certain existing rights in, and have responsibility for your User Content.

You retain any and all Intellectual Property Rights you already hold under applicable law in Content you upload, publish, and submit to or through the Servers, Websites, and other areas of the Service, subject to the rights, licenses, and other terms of this Agreement, including any underlying rights of other users or Manticore in Content that you may use or modify.

Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in your User Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section.

You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it on the Websites. In connection with Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant that you (a) own and have all necessary Intellectual Property Rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Manticore and Users of the Service to use the User Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms; (b) the User Content does not and, as to Manticore’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in this Agreement, will not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Right or other right of any third party; and (c) the User Content will not violate this Agreement or any Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person.

Your copy and use of Content is at your own risk. You are solely responsible and liable for your use, reproduction, distribution, modification, display, or performance of any Content in violation of any Intellectual Property Rights. You agree that Manticore will have no liability for, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Manticore harmless for, any claims, losses, or damages arising out of or in connection with your use, reproduction, distribution, modification, display or performance of any Content.

Because the law may or may not recognize certain Intellectual Property Rights in any particular Content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for knowing, protecting and enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights that you hold, and that Manticore cannot do so on your behalf.

Manticore has no obligation to monitor or enforce your Intellectual Property Rights to your User Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at our cost and expense) to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint Manticore as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with an interest.

D.        You grant Manticore certain licenses to your User Content.

Unless otherwise agreed to in a written agreement between you and Manticore that was signed by an authorized representative of Manticore, if you submit, transmit, display, perform, post, or store User Content using the Service, you grant Manticore and its sublicensees, to the furthest extent and for the maximum period permitted by applicable law (including in perpetuity if permitted under applicable law), an unrestricted, worldwide, irrevocable, fully sublicensable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free right to (a) use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display such User Content (including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof)) in any form, format, media, or media channels now known or later developed or discovered, and (b) use the name, identity, likeness, and voice (or other biographical information) that you submit in connection with such User Content. Should such User Content contain name, identity, likeness, and voice (or other biographical information) of third parties, you represent and warrant that you have obtained the appropriate consents and/or licenses for your use of such features and that Manticore and its sub-licensees are allowed to use them to the extent indicated in these Terms.

Manticore may, but will not have the obligation to, display, maintain, or otherwise make use of, any of your User Content, and Manticore may, in its sole discretion, modify, delete, or otherwise make use of User Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party. Manticore reserves the right to treat User Content on the Service as content stored at the direction of Users for which Manticore will not exercise control except to block or remove content that comes to Manticore’s attention and is offensive, obscene, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable to Manticore, or to enforce the rights of third parties or the content restrictions set forth below, when notice of their violation comes to our attention. Such User Content submitted by you or others need not, however, be maintained on the Service by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, maintain, or otherwise use such User Content on the Service.

E.        You grant certain licenses to other Users by publicly sharing your User Content.

You agree that by uploading, publishing, or submitting your User Content to any publicly accessible areas of the Service, you hereby grant other Users of that aspect of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Content on the Service as permitted through your interactions with the Service under these Terms (the “User Content License”).

You agree that by uploading, publishing, or submitting your User Content to or through the Servers for display in any publicly accessible area of the Service, you hereby grant other Users a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to photograph, capture an image of, film, and/or record a video of your User Content, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the resulting photograph, image, film, or video in any current or future media (the “Media License”).

If you do not wish to grant Users of the Service a User Content License or Media License, you must not display, upload, or make available your User Content to other Users on our Websites or through our Services.

You acknowledge that when you receive a User Content License, you receive only licensing and use rights; therefore, you do not acquire ownership  of any other Intellectual Property Rights of the User Content.

F.        You may unpublish your User Content and terminate any related licenses, with limitations.

With respect to any User Content you have submitted, uploaded, or displayed through the Service, the licenses granted by you hereunder will terminate once you unpublish such User Content from the Service, except (a) to the extent you shared it as part of the Service; (b) Manticore has already used it for promotional purposes prior to deletion. In such circumstances, the licenses granted by you above shall terminate, but only in relation to the particular piece of User Content that you have unpublished from the Service. You acknowledge that this termination will not apply to any other copies or instances of the same User Content that you have not specifically unpublished from the Service, including without limitation those that may be displayed elsewhere through the Service and those that may be in the Account inventories of other Users to whom you transferred copies of the User Content. You acknowledge that the Media License granted to Manticore and other Users with respect to your User Content will survive any such termination and that your User Content may continue to remain on our Servers even after you unpublish your User Content.

6.        UPLOAD CONTENT AT YOUR OWN RISK

Manticore uses reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect User Content against unauthorized copying and distribution. However, Manticore does not guarantee that unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties will not occur. To the furthest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby agree that Manticore shall not be liable for any unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties and release and forever waive any claims you may have against Manticore for such unauthorized copying or usage of such User Content, under any theory. THE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT USER CONTENT USED BY MANTICORE HEREIN ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, ASSURANCES, OR OTHER TERMS THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SECURITY MECHANISMS OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO BREACHES, DISABLEMENTS OR OTHER CIRCUMVENTION OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES.

7\. ASSUMPTION OF RISK

You agree that:

1. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your purchases and sales of Content or NFTs. Manticore is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to NFT  transactions.
2. Manticore is not responsible for exploits that are not reasonably foreseeable. While Manticore has taken a number of precautions to ensure the security of the Core platform, the technology is relatively new, and it is not possible to guarantee that the code is 100% free from bugs or errors.
3. Neither the Website nor the Core platform stores, sends or receives NFTs. The NFTs are minted and transferred on a smart Contract maintained by Manticore. Any transfers of NFTs occur via the smart Contract located on the Ethereum or Solana blockchain and not on this Website or Core platform.
4. There are risks associated with accepting cryptocurrencies as payment and purchasing blockchain based NFTs, including but not limited to, the risk of losing private keys, theft of cryptocurrency or NFTs due to hackers finding out your private key, lack of a secondary market, significant price volatility, hard forks and disruptions to the blockchain network. You accept and acknowledge that transfers on the blockchain are irreversible and as a result, it is not possible for Manticore to issue refunds on purchases.
5. There is a risk that Manticore may be obligated to take down listings and remove your User Content from the Websites if it has received a Digital Millennium Copyright Notice (“DMCA Notice”) under Section 16. Manticore may also be obligated to serve a DMCA Notice to its content storage provider. If this occurs, the NFT may no longer reference your User Content. NFTs linked to images and/or audio files subject to a DMCA Notice may subsequently lose value.
6. Where an NFT  has been delisted from the Website, owners of the delisted NFT must interact with the smart contract directly or find an external source to update their NFT.
7. Manticore cannot guarantee payment of any royalties to Users where transactions involving NFTs occur on third-party platforms or directly between Users.        

8\. PROHIBITED CONDUCT

A.        You agree to comport yourself while using the Service.

(vii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Service or any part thereof, except and only to the extent that this activity is expressly permitted by the law of your jurisdiction of residence;

B.        Manticore is a service provider and is not responsible for other parties’ conduct.

You understand that Manticore is a service provider that enables its Users to interact online and display and communicate information and Content chosen by those Users. You acknowledge that you will be exposed to various aspects of the Service involving the conduct, Content, and services of other Users, and that Manticore does not control and is not responsible or liable for the quality, safety, legality, truthfulness, or accuracy of any such User conduct, User Content, or user services. You acknowledge that Manticore does not guarantee the accuracy of information submitted by any User of the Service, nor any identity information about any User. Manticore does not control or endorse any User Content, opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Manticore expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. Your interactions with other Users and your use of User Content are entirely at your own risk. Manticore has no obligation to become involved in any dispute that you may have or claim to have with one or more Users of the Service, or in any manner in any resolution thereof.

Manticore takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content or for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, nor is Manticore liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter when using the Service. Your use of the Service is at your own risk. In addition, these rules do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Service will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Manticore reserves the right to remove, screen, or edit any User Content posted or stored on the Service at any time and without notice, including where such User Content violates these Terms or applicable law, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Service at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Service in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms and may result in, among other things, suspension or termination of your rights to use the Service.

Manticore prohibits the solicitation, offer, purchase, sale or distribution of securities on the Websites. You agree not to use the Services to solicit, offer, purchase, sell or otherwise distribute securities. No NFTs are intended to be classified as a security and no transaction in any NFT is intended to constitute a securities transaction under the U.S. federal securities laws, U.S. state laws, or by foreign authorities.

1. You agree that neither Manticore nor the Websites are acting as a securities broker or dealer with respect to any transactions in the NFTs accessed through the Websites.
2. You agree that neither Manticore nor the Websites are facilitating clearing or settlement of securities through the Websites.
3. Neither Manticore nor the Websites are registered or licensed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or foreign authorities as a broker-dealer, national securities exchange, or ATS (or foreign equivalents), and we do not seek to register or rely on an exemption from such registration or license to facilitate the offer and sale of NFTs on the Websites. We only permit transfers of NFTs on the Websites of those NFTs which are not securities. In the event that Manticore determines there is a reasonable basis upon which to conclude that an NFT is a security or transactions in a NFT constitute securities transactions, such NFT will be removed from the Websites.

A.        Disclaimers; No Warranties

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (I) THE SERVICES AND THE CONTENT AND MATERIALS CONTAINED THEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN A WRITING BY MANTICORE; (II) MANTICORE, AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND ITS AND THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS, LICENSORS, AND SUBCONTRACTORS (THE “MANTICORE PARTIES”) DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT, AUTHORITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE (WHETHER OR NOT WE KNOW OR HAVE REASON TO KNOW OF ANY SUCH PURPOSE), SYSTEM INTEGRATION, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS, RESULTS, REASONABLE CARE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, LACK OF NEGLIGENCE, AND LACK OF VIRUSES, WHETHER ALLEGED TO ARISE UNDER LAW, BY REASON OF CUSTOM OR USAGE IN THE TRADE, OR BY COURSE OF DEALING; (III) WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE MANTICORE PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE AND RELATED MATERIALS (1) WILL OPERATE PROPERLY, (2) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR (3) WILL OPERATE IN AN UNINTERRUPTED, BUG FREE, OR ERROR FREE MANNER. ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN SECTION 2-312 OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR IN ANY OTHER COMPARABLE STATUTE IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY THE MANTICORE PARTIES. THE MANTICORE PARTIES DO NOT GUARANTEE CONTINUOUS, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, OR SECURE OPERATION OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE(S) AND RELATED MATERIALS. YOU SHOULD USE INDUSTRY-RECOGNIZED SECURITY SOFTWARE TO DETECT AND DISINFECT VIRUSES FROM ANY DOWNLOAD. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM MANTICORE OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. THIS PARAGRAPH WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

B.        Liability Limits

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE MANTICORE PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR RELATED MATERIALS, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OUTAGE OR CONGESTION, HARD FORKS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE, MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. IN NO EVENT WILL THE MANTICORE PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR RELATED MATERIALS, OR THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE OR LACK OF FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SERVICE OR RELATED MATERIALS, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THEIR FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS REGARDING DAMAGES APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION.

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, THE LIABILITY OF MANTICORE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AND THEIR AFFILIATES, AND THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

C.        Basis of the Bargain

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MANTICORE HAS OFFERED THE SERVICE, USER CONTENT, AND OTHER CONTENT AND INFORMATION, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND MANTICORE, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND MANTICORE. MANTICORE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

D.        Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold the Manticore Parties harmless from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, including legal fees and expenses, (collectively, “Claims”) arising out of your use or misuse of the Services, any User Content that you post, store or otherwise transmit in or through the Service(s), your violation of the rights of any third party, any violation by you of these Terms, or any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein.

Manticore reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Manticore, and you agree to cooperate with Manticore’s defense of these Claims. Manticore will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

14.        DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PROVISION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH MANTICORE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MANTICORE.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (but excluding those identified below), you and Manticore agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Service, except that you and Manticore are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.

ARBITRATION OPT-OUT: You may opt out of resolving disputes by arbitration by writing to us at Manticore Games, Inc., Attention: Legal, 1800 Gateway Drive, San Francisco, CA 94404 within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms and telling us you would like to opt out of mandatory arbitration. You must include your first and last name in the letter.

ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.

You and Manticore agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Manticore should be sent to: Manticore Games, Inc., Attention: Legal, 1400 Fashion Island Boulevard, San Francisco, CA 94404.

You and Manticore further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in San Mateo County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS ([www.JAMSADR.COM](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jamsadr.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1654543211021834&usg=AOvVaw1VZW4LUjL_ipKm8OIy8hro)); and that the state or federal courts in San Mateo County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals or an arbitration award or over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Manticore will not commence against the other party a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then the following shall apply:

Any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence.

Any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence.

Claims

YOU AND MANTICORE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE(S) MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. THIS LIMITATION DOES NOT APPLY WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

15.        GENERAL PROVISIONS

A.        Waiver

If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms, it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.

B.        Severability

If any provision of these Terms or any Additional Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

C.        Assignment

These Terms and any Additional Terms or Related Policies, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Manticore without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this provision shall be void.

D.        Survival

Upon termination of these Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 5, 12, and 13.

E.        Entire Agreement

The Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, Code of Conduct, any Additional Terms and Related Policies, are the entire agreement between you and Manticore relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed or otherwise agreed to by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by Manticore as set forth herein.
