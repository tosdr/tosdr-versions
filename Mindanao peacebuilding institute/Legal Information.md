Privacy Notice
==============

13 July 2013 Last Updated: 19 October 2023

[![DPO DPS Registration keyhole graphic with the following text: NATIONAL PRIVACY COMMISSION DPO/DPS DATA PROTECTION OFFICER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM REGISTERED "DATOS NG PILIPINO, PROTEKTADO KO!" VALIDITY PERIOD 23 April 2024 Atty. John Henry D. Naga PRIVACY COMMISSIONER](/images/DPO_DPS_Registration_2023-2024.jpg)](https://mpiasia.net/images/DPO_DPS_Registration_2023-2024.jpg)The Mindanao Peacebuilding Institute Foundation, Inc. (MPI) considers your privacy very important and adheres to the [2012 Data Privacy Act of the Philippines](https://www.privacy.gov.ph/data-privacy-act-primer/). Whether you are just a visitor to our website or you are a registered user because you are an alumna/us or somehow connected to MPI, or if MPI holds your personal information in any other manner, we take our responsibility to protect your privacy as securely as possible. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Notice in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose, and make use of personal information.

**1\. Information We Collect and How We Use Your Information**

We will collect and use personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law. We do not disclose your information to third parties not involved in any transaction process.

1. Website Registration: When registering for the Site as an alumna/us or part of the MPI network, we request your name, organization, email, relationship to MPI, and general location in order to understand who is connecting with us and to help alumni connect with one another. We also request alumni to indicate the year(s) and course(s) they took in order to give access to handouts and to assist in connecting alumni with one another.
2. MPI Occasional Newsletter: MPI offers visitors to our website the opportunity to subscribe to our occasional newsletter. When subscribing to our newsletter, we request your email address, first name, last name, organization, country, job position, and relationship to MPI. MPI will use the information you provide on the subscription form to send you our newsletter only. The information helps us to send emails to specific segments of our mailing list and to know who is interested in MPI. We do not sell or make our lists or individual contact information available to any organization without your expressed consent.
3. Application for and Participants in MPI Trainings: Individuals applying for and participating in an MPI training program or activity will be asked to submit information appropriate to the training and for acceptance and placement. Details on what information is collected and why can be found under the specific applications.
4. MPI Alumni and Alumni Newsletter: When individuals register for one of our training programs, they provide the necessary information for being accepted and placed in our courses. It is from that information that we take what is needed for our alumni database and mailing list. The information that is included in the mailing lists consists of your name, email address, alternative email addresses (if available), organization, position, country, and year in which you participated in the Annual Peacebuilding Training or other training. Aside from allowing us to maintain contact and send the Alumni Newsletter emails and personalize them, this information also allows us to segment our mailing lists and to know what organizations are represented and by whom.
5. Analytics and Statistics: MPI collects anonymous statistical information through [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) to understand broad demographic information about visitors to the Site. This information is utilized to improve the Site and our services. See "Third-Party Services" below.
6. Email Inquiries: When visitors to the website use our "Contact Us" form, MPI collects the email address, name, and information provided in the inquiry in order to respond to the request.
7. Discussion Forums: The Discussion Forums on the Site are limited to registered users. However, you should still exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information. You may request assistance in removing any personal information from the forums by [contacting us](https://mpiasia.net/aboutus/contact-us.html).
8. Testimonials: Testimonials may be posted by MPI or by individuals who would like to do so. All testimonials are reviewed by MPI before final posting, but if you would like to change any information on the testimonial or have it removed, please [contact us](https://mpiasia.net/aboutus/contact-us.html).

**2\. Data Security**

MPI uses multiple security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

MPI's website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to protect the website and transmission of data. In the unlikely event of a data breach, MPI will notify the appropriate regulatory and/or legal authorities, as well as affected alumni/users/individuals, within seventy-two (72) hours.

**3\. Storage and Processing**

The information MPI collects may be stored and processed in the United States, Canada, Europe, or the Philippines.

For information transmitted, stored, and processed in the Philippines, MPI is bound by and adheres to [Republic Act 10173 – Data Privacy Act of 2012](https://privacy.gov.ph/data-privacy-act/).

**4\. How We Protect Your Information**

MPI makes every effort to protect the personal information it collects by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification

However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit through our site or other forms of electronic communication or guarantee that your information on the website or held by MPI may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any industry standard physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as login information) on our registration or other forms, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmitting data over the Internet is 100% secure. If you have any questions about security on our website, please [contact us](https://mpiasia.net/aboutus/contact-us.html).

**5\. EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC**

For E.U. clients, MPI makes every effort to comply with the [EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:31995L0046) framework as set forth by the European Union regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

**6\. Cookies**

Like most interactive websites this site uses cookies to enable Mindanao Peacebuilding Institute Foundation, Inc. to retrieve user details for each visit.

Please see our [Terms of Use](https://mpiasia.net/termsofuse.html) for details on what cookies are, how we use cookies, how third parties we may partner with may use cookies on the site, your choices regarding cookies, and further information about cookies. All visitors to our website may opt out of all but the necessary cookies.

**7\. Third-Party Services**

MPI uses third-party services to store and process some information it collects, and in doing so monitors the practices and policies of those services to assure compliance with the data privacy of our users and clients.

When someone visits our website, we use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. We do this to find out the number of visitors to various parts of the site, how visitors get to our site, how long a visitor stays on our site, etc. In doing so, we utilize the [IP anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) mode to minimize the ability to identify an individual.

MPI uses [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/features/marketing-automation/) to send out its newsletter to its alumni. The information mentioned above under "Information We Collect and How We Use Your Information" is what is submitted to MailChimp. Please see [MailChimp's Legal Policies](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) with respect to their own privacy policies and the use of data.

**8\. Donations/Payments to MPI**

MPI makes it possible for individuals or organizations to make donations or payments for services to the Mindanao Peacebuilding Institute Foundation, Inc. through third-party services for donation processing (e.g. payment processors).

We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) is the payment processor with which MPI works. Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at [https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.)
