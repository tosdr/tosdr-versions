Further claims by the User are considered to hereby be invalid. Altered Terms & Conditions take effect immediately as soon as the User has accepted these alterations.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, should there be any contradictions between these Terms and Conditions and the rules of a game or conditions of participation, the conditions of these Terms and Conditions shall, in principle, apply in governing the circumstances that have given rise to the respective contradiction(s).

7.1.1 Use of Services (Free2Play model) free of charge

In principle, Crayon Games provides Users with free Services in accordance to the Free2Play model as of the creation of a User Account (see Section 1.2 above). The Free2Play model enables the use of the portal and the availability of Games and Services, which are generally unlimited in terms of time and content. To make this possible, the User is provided with free virtual items right at the portal that can be obtained in regular intervals. However, in this Free2Play version, the User certainly may not find himself/herself with access to all features or in-game levels or Services right from the start.

7.1.2 Additional virtual items

The User has the option of receiving additional virtual items against payment of a fee. User who use the services exclusively free of charge (Free2Play model) that are not available in the basic version either immediately or certainly when, to a lesser extent. Additional virtual items can either promote or accelerate the individual game progress of the User or enable more individual game variations. Which or just how many virtual items are offered at which price or tariff, which functions they specifically have, and which exact uses they offer, can be found right in the portal or in the descriptions of the respective Games and/or game rules or respective conditions of participation. Crayon Games therefore reserves the right to offer new virtual items at any time. In the course of adapting and further developing our Games, Crayon Games also reserves the right to no longer offer individual virtual items. All prices for additional virtual items are gross prices, i.e. including any applicable taxes. The fee for ordering virtual objects is due immediately and must be paid in advance (see Section 7.1.4 below). Games are constantly being developed and while adapting and further developing our Games, Crayon Games also reserves the right to no longer offer individual Games or Services. Any service fees paid in advance over the termination period for virtual objects or subscriptions that have not yet been credited or booked to the User’s account or used by the User shall be reimbursed to the User on a pro-rata basis and thus, in this case, all further claims are excluded. In the case of permanent suspension of a Service or individual Games, Section 1.2.15 shall apply.

7.1.3 Subscription/Automatic Renewal

If payments for additional virtual items are to be made at regular intervals (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly, quarter yearly, half yearly, yearly, etc.), the User effectively enters into a subscription for these Premium Features that shall automatically be renewed if it is not cancelled in a timely manner by the User before the end of the set time limit as stipulated in Section 8.2 below. The subscription terms are described in the game rules and/or Conditions of Participation for the respective Games.

7.1.4 Payment Conditions and Due Date of Payment

Crayon Games is authorized to ask the User for advance payment for the use of additional virtual items (see Section 7.1.2 above). Such payment shall be due upon conclusion of the agreement and shall, by choice of the User, be debited from the provided bank account or charged to the credit card account provided by the User, inasmuch as the User has not opted for another form of payment, for example, the payment methods offered in the portal. The amount to be collected shall be displayed on bills from payment providers or bank account statements with as booking text such as " WWW.Crayon Games.COM " or "Crayon Games ", "Jackpot", "MyJackpot", etc. The name or title may deviate when making use of alternative payment methods. If a payment should be made via a mobile telephony-supported payment method (i.e. Premium-SMS, Premium Call, Short Cods, etc.), the order and payment made by the owner of the mobile phone connection making use of the mobile phone application is deemed to be approved and having been initiated on behalf of the User, provided of course that the User and connection owners are different.

7.1.5 Adjustment of Fees for virtual Items

Crayon Games reserves the right to reduce or raise prices for all Services that do not represent a subscription (a continuing obligation) permanently or for a limited period of time or to offer new products, services or methods of payment at any time, either on a temporary or permanent basis. Until termination of the agreement, the original Terms & Conditions shall remain in effect without prejudice to the rights of the User as per Section 8.2 and Section 8.3.

7.1.6 Adjustments to Charges for Subscriptions

Crayon Games is entitled to adjust the fees for the contractually agreed to services for continuing obligations as per the following conditions: A price alteration for subscriptions shall be announced to the User at least six weeks before its entry into force. As a rule, reference is made to the alterations/amendments to the fees for subscriptions in text form per email or per highlighted announcement right in the User account at the portal or on the website featuring the Games or in the Games themselves the next time the User logs in. The User has an extraordinary six-week right to object to the announced price change or terminate the agreement as of the date of the announcement of the price change. Any service fees possibly paid for virtual objects in advance (going beyond the time of the price change) that have not yet been credited or booked to the User’s account due to the subscription or used by the User shall be reimbursed to the User on a pro-rata basis. All further claims are then prohibited. Crayon Games shall indicate these rights in its announcement. If the User does not exercise this right within the respective time period, the price change is considered as being approved. Price reductions generally apply in principle as of the announced date for the next invoicing period.

#### 7.2 Late Payment

In case of late payment, Crayon Games is authorized to charge interest set to the applicable legal lending rate in the EU. Crayon Games is also entitled to discontinue Services and to suspend the User’s Account(s) if payment is overdue. For the period of a suspension, no performance fee is payable for any closed subscriptions.

#### 7.3 Direct Debit Reversals, Cancellation Fees

If Crayon Games incurs costs and/or losses or if Crayon Games is charged a cancellation fee due to a cancelled direct debit payment as a result of User fault or circumstances leading back to the User (for example, if the User does not have an adequate or sufficient account balance), the User shall bear all cancellation fees generated for Crayon Games as a result of these actions. Crayon Games is entitled to demand payment of the costs incurred from repeated attempts to debit the charges from the User’s account together with the original fees. The User is entitled to prove that no damage occurred or that a substantially lower level of damage was caused due to late payment.

#### 7.4 Playing for entertainment only

The Games and Services are for entertainment purposes only. If currencies are simulated in the games, these are merely in-game units of measurement. Playing or acquiring virtual items on the portal does not constitute any intangible or tangible assets. The Users generally do not have the right to claim the payout of prizes or the transfer of a prize, unless such a claim is explicitly outlined in these Terms & Conditions or the Conditions of Participation at the portal or the respective website of the game or services. A claim to the rewarding or payout of a prize can only be permitted in the course of gaming activity or a raffle conducted at the portal if Crayon Games has explicitly offered/advertised such a prize. A claim to the prize also does not exist if Crayon Games learns that a potential claim to a prize may be the result of technical or legal manipulations and/or, in general, the result of any other kind of criminal conduct. By using Crayon Games and Services, Users thereby agree that Crayon Games may conduct a thorough investigation at any time pertaining to the legality of the claim for prizes, and while this claim is under investigation, may withhold the prize from the User without his/her express consent. A claim to a prize shall also be forfeited if the User has not complied with the rules of the Game.

#### 7.5 No Set­off; No Right of Retention; No Cession

The User may only set off a claim by Crayon Games for outstanding accounts if his/her counterclaims cannot be disputed or have been declared legally binding. The User can only withhold payment if his/her counterclaim is related to the same Terms & Conditions. The right of the User to assign his/her claims to a Third Party is invalid.

#### 7.6 Services

Unless otherwise stipulated in the Service description, Services can be used free of charge. Furthermore, Sections 7.1 through 7.5 apply to fee-based Services.

### 8\. Term, Cancellation

#### 8.1 Duration

All agreements entered into between the User and Crayon Games are for an indeterminate period of time should nothing to the contrary be determined in the concrete offer provided by Crayon Games.

#### 8.2 Orderly Cancellation

8.2.1 Subject to the condition that the period of termination is respected, each party is legally entitled to terminate the contractual agreement without provision of any reasons, provided that the following is fulfilled:

8.2.2 If no limited period of time has been agreed upon for an agreement, both parties may terminate the contractual agreement in a due and orderly manner with immediate effect.

8.2.3 If an agreement for using/providing additional virtual features (see Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3) has been agreed upon for a set period of time (subscription), said agreement shall be automatically renewed for the same contractual period, until the User cancels the subscription by the end of the respective contractual period.

#### 8.3 Just grounds for cancellation

8.3.1 The parties may also terminate the contractual agreement for important reasons at any time without prejudice to the above regulations.

8.3.2 In the event that Crayon Games is responsible for a premature termination of the contractual agreement for important reasons, the User shall receive a pro rata refund for any payments made by them in advance beyond the termination date for virtual items or subscriptions that have not yet been credited or booked to the user's account or used by the User which apply to the period after the termination becomes effective. All other claims of the User are considered invalid unless otherwise specified in these Terms & Conditions.

Crayon Games has the right to terminate the contractual agreement especially for, but not limited to, the following reasons:

a. The User culpably violates the law, these Terms and Conditions, the rules of the game(s) and/or the Conditions of Participation, and – despite having been warned accordingly – repeatedly fails to behave in a proper manner according to the rules and regulations.

b. The User defaults on the payment of the fees amounting to at least 10.00 EUR and does not pay them despite having been reminded of due fees twice.

c. Third Parties (i.e. social network operators), whose login functions are used by the User to gain access to his/her account with the provider, then request the User to delete User data and/or take comparable measures; if an alternative form of access would be unreasonable for the provider.

d. Third Parties (i.e. operators or social networks), whose login functions are used by the User to gain access to his/her account with the provider, then limit the access of the provider to the User data, as long as an alternative form of access would be unreasonable for the provider.

8.3.3 In the event of serious violations, an immediate cancellation is permitted without the need for any prior warning. A serious violation is an infringement making it impossible for Crayon Games to continue upholding the agreement, thus making it null and void. This is usually the case

a. if the User violates penal laws

b. if the User improperly uses the account, games, or service.

c. if the User provides incorrect information when registering or paying for services that must be paid for.

8.3.4 In cases of cancellations justified by Crayon Games based on just grounds, Crayon Games is entitled to demand compensation from the User for any resulting damage.

8.3.5 Should Crayon Games be responsible for the extraordinary cancellation and the User’s player account still feature virtual items, Crayon Games shall accredit any service fees paid in advance beyond the point in time of the cancellation for any virtual items that have not yet been credited or booked to the User’s account or used by the User or reimburse a subscription pro rata. Any further claims on behalf of the User are excluded unless otherwise determined by these Terms and Conditions.

8.3.6 Crayon Games has a special right to cancel the User’s registration for Games or Services in the event that Crayon Games should lose the right to operate these Games or Services, e.g. for regulatory reasons or due to a termination of the relevant license agreement between Crayon Games and the respective licensor. In this case, Crayon Games may conduct an extraordinary termination of all agreements relating to the operation and use of the Game or Service (for example, the License Agreement, Agreement on the Provision and Use of virtual Currency or Premium Features, etc.) at the time game-play is established. The provision in Section 8.3.5 shall then apply. Any other termination rights remain unaffected.

8.3.7 Virtual currency that is granted free of charge or Premium Features are generally excluded from any form of reimbursement.

#### 8.4 Termination in Written Form

Any and all terminations require the written form in order to become effective (i.e. email)

### 9\. Responsibilities and Other Obligations of the User; Liability for Information Uploaded by the User; Copyright

#### 9.1 User Responsibilities

It shall be the primary responsibility of the User to pay any and all applicable fees unless he/she uses the basic version of the Games and/or Services (see Paragraph 7 above). Furthermore, the User shall comply with all applicable game rules and provide accurate and complete information to Crayon Games upon entering into this agreement and through the duration thereof. Therefore, the User declares that all information relating to his/her person or other facts relevant to the agreement (especially bank or credit card details) and which he/she provides on the User application or during the course of the contractual agreement are complete and correct to the best of his/her knowledge. The User is obligated to inform Crayon Games about any changes to this information without undue delay. The User is obliged to follow the game rules. In the case of repeated violation of the rules despite warnings to this effect, or in the case of a severe breach of the rules (see Section 8.3), Crayon Games reserves the right to suspend all services immediately and without warning, and to cancel the agreement.

#### 9.2 Installation of Software

Crayon Games is not liable for damages or a loss of data experienced by the User on his/her computer, mobile phone or other User (mobile) terminal devices (hereby referred to as “terminal device”) used for the Games and Services which may be caused by the installation of software that does not originate from Crayon Games.

#### 9.3 Further Obligations of the User

9.3.1 Crayon Games provides the available Games and Services online. Crayon Games neither provides nor installs any of the software required by the User on his/her terminal device, especially, but not limited to, the operating system, web browser(s) or plug­ins such as Flash or Java, if applicable. Crayon Games also does not provide any support services for such software installations. It is solely the User’s responsibility to maintain the terminal device in a state which enables the use of Crayon Games or Services. Therefore, Crayon Games does not provide any kind of technical support for the installation of locally required software.

9.3.2 The User is obligated to treat all data provided by Crayon Games for the purpose of accessing the Games and Services (login, passwords etc.) in a strictly confidential manner. The User shall inform Crayon Games without delay if he or she learns or suspects that an unauthorized Third Party has gained possession of said access data. Crayon Games advises the User to do this in written or text form, e.g. via email. In the event that a Third Party gains access to Crayon Games’ Games or Services with the User’s access data because the User neglected to sufficiently protect the account from unauthorized access, the User must, due to the danger of an uncertainty caused by him/her regarding who misused the account or was responsible for a contractual or legal infringement of said account, assume the responsibility for said actions as if he/she had performed these actions himself/herself. Crayon Games is entitled to evaluate all entries into an account with the User's data as the entry of the User into the account. Crayon Games advises that passwords should be regularly changed for security reasons. The User is solely responsible for the access to and use of his/her Account.

9.3.3 In the event that Crayon Games has a justifiable reason to believe that an unauthorized Third Party is wrongly in possession of access data, Crayon Games may, but is not required to, at its own discretion, change the account access data without prior notice or suspend the respective Account. Crayon Games shall promptly inform the rightful User and shall, upon request, communicate the new access data to him or her without undue delay. The User has no right to demand that the original access data be restored.

9.3.4 The User is not entitled to sell his or her account or virtual items to a Third Party or in any other way, shape or manner lend or transfer it. The User does not acquire ownership or any rights to the content of any virtual items possibly obtained on the portal for a fee, much less free of charge. Virtual items may not be transferred or resold in any manner or commercial purposes, including (but not limited to) direct sales or auctions. Virtual items may not be bought or sold by any individual or any other company through cash, money transfer, or any other form of transaction. Virtual items have no monetary value and cannot be used to purchase or use any product or service outside of the platform. Virtual items cannot be refunded or exchanged for cash or any other tangible asset.

9.3.5 Crayon Games protects its systems against viruses. Even so, virus infections can never be completely ruled out. In addition, it is possible that unauthorized Third Parties may send emails using the name of Crayon Games without Crayon Games's consent, and that such emails may contain viruses, spyware or links to web content which, in turn, may contain viruses or spyware. Crayon Games has no influence over such occurrences. The User agrees to check all incoming mail sent or supposedly sent by or in the name of Crayon Games for potential viruses. The same applies to mails from other Users of the Games or Services.

9.3.6 The User agrees to abide by the instructions of Crayon Games, its employees, assignees, and vicarious agents, especially including but not limited to administrators and moderators of forums for a specific game and/or service.

9.3.7 The User agrees that he or she shall not, under any circumstances, use the Account, login name or password of another User.

j. providing picture(s) of another person without that person’s express consent.

9.4.6 The User is not entitled to demand that such deleted information be restored. Furthermore, Crayon Games is also entitled to exclude the offending User from continued use of the respective Service(s) and, in case of repeated infringements of the aforementioned prohibitions despite written notice, to terminate the User’s Account without prior warning. Crayon Games reserves the right to make any further necessary and additional claims, particularly the entitlement to damages.

9.4.7 The User shall inform Crayon Games in case he/she becomes aware of an abuse of the Service(s) by other Users or Third Parties, such as making accessible or sending information that violates this Section 9.4. To ensure that effective measures can be taken, Crayon Games requests that such information be provided in writing (e.g. email).

#### 9.5 User’s Liability Regarding Uploaded Information

### 10\. Claims Based on Defects

10.1 Crayon Games grants the User access to the Games and Services in their current version only (Section 1.2). The User has no right to demand the maintenance or restoring of a particular version or range of functions of the Games and Services. The User acknowledges and agrees that the Games and Services provided by Crayon Games, as with any other software, can never be completely free of errors. Therefore, the Games and Services can only be considered to be defective if their playability or usability is affected severely and over a sustained period of time. Any faults in the Games and Services and/or other deliveries of Crayon Games need to be documented by the User in writing along with a protocol of the error messages displayed for the purpose of securing evidence in a suitable form (i.e. in text form via an email) and then sent to Crayon Games. Before reporting a potential bug, the User shall consult the instructions for the Games and Services and any other troubleshooting tools provided by Crayon Games (especially frequently asked question lists and boards for troubleshooting). The User shall use his/her best efforts to support Crayon Games in any attempts to debug the Game or Service in question.

10.2 The User shall notify Crayon Games in writing of the faults discovered and documented in accordance with Section 10.1 within 14 days upon discovering them or provide Crayon Games of notification of defects.

10.3 Crayon Games is not liable for defects caused by external influences, faulty handling by the User, force majeure or changes or manipulations which are not performed by Crayon Games.

10.4 Crayon Games does not assume any guarantees or warranties.

### 11\. Liability and Limitation of Liability

11.1 The User shall be directly and immediately liable to Third Parties for violating any of their rights. The User shall indemnify and hold Crayon Games harmless against any damage caused by his or her failure to observe these Terms and Conditions. The User shall indemnify and hold Crayon Games harmless against any and all claims by Third Parties that the posting of any content by the User or any other violations of these Terms of Use by him or her violates their respective rights. The User shall also be responsible for any legal costs Crayon Games may incur as a result of the said failure to comply with the Terms of Use, including court costs and attorney fees. This shall only apply in the event the User is responsible for any such infringement.

11.2 Provided that Crayon Games offers its services free of charge, Crayon Games shall only be liable for intentionally caused damage or damage caused by gross negligence. This, however, does not apply to liability regarding loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health, or the assumption of a guarantee offered by Crayon Games.

11.3 Insofar as Crayon Games demands payment for its Services, Crayon Games shall assume liability for damage caused by intent and gross negligence without limitation. In the event of simple negligence, Crayon Games shall only be liable for breaches to substantial agreement stipulations or breaches of a guarantee. Substantial contractual stipulations include those that enable the agreement to be properly executed and on which fulfillment the User may rely. The above limitations of liability do not apply to liability regarding loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health, or the assumption of a guarantee offered by Crayon Games. Crayon Games's liability regarding the Product Liability Act or within the scope of § 44a of the German Telecommunications Act remains unaffected.

11.4 The obligation to pay damages or compensation is limited to a slightly negligent breach of material contractual obligations as understood in Section 12.3, Sentence 3, for the foreseeable and contractually typical damage or loss at the time the agreement is concluded.

11.5 The above exclusions or restrictions shall also apply with regard to the liability of staff, employees, representatives and/or agents of Crayon Games, especially for the benefit of shareholders, employees, representatives, company bodies, and their members with regard to their personal liability.

11.6 Crayon Games is liable for consultation only, as far as the question has concerned the contents of the offer.

11.7 Crayon Games expressly distances itself from the content of all pages to which direct or indirect reference (also known as "links") is made from within the Services offered by Crayon Games. Crayon Games is in no way whatsoever liable for such content or pages. The providers of the respective sites are responsible for their content.

### 12\. Online Dispute Resolution

12.2. The Crayon Games email address is provided in the company’s IMPRINT section. We are neither obligated nor willing to participate in the dispute resolution process.

### 13\. Data Protection Regulations

Information on the type, scope, location, and purpose of the collection, processing, and use of personal information and details by Crayon Games (in the context of the contractual relationship as well as the User’s rights to information, respective correction thereof, the blocking and deletion of his/her personal information) can be viewed in the portal’s Data Protection Regulations.

### 14\. Final Clauses

14.1 Users are not entitled to transfer their rights under this contractual relationship to Third Parties. Anything else can only apply if Crayon Games gives its prior expressed written consent in text form. Crayon Games is entitled to transfer the rights and obligations resulting from this contractual relationship to a Third Party. The User shall be informed of any such transfer at least four weeks in advance per announcement at the Portal and/or email notification. The User then has the option to withdraw from use of the Services without having to uphold any deadlines - Section 8.3.5 applies mutatis mutandis.

14.2 For any agreements concluded on the basis of these Terms & Conditions, and thus for any related claims, the law practiced by the Federal Republic of Germany shall exclusively apply to the exclusion of the UN Sales Convention. Should the user have concluded this agreement as a consumer, then the mandatory consumer protection provisions applicable in the Federal State in which the user maintains his/her habitual residency shall apply, provided they actually provide a higher or further level of protection.

14.3 Should individual provisions and/or conditions of these Terms and Conditions be or become ineffective, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions and/or conditions.
