Privacy Policy
==============

WorldVPN is committed to protecting your privacy. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don’t collect, and how we collect, use, and store information.We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration.

Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We designed our systems to not have sensitive data about our customers; even when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess.

This privacy policy will help you understand how WorldVPN (“WorldVPN,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and stores information.

Learn more about the independent audit report of our privacy protections.

General Information
===================

WorldVPN collects three types of information:
=============================================

(i) Information related to your account (“personal information”)
================================================================

This information is collected for the purpose of administering your WorldVPN subscription and includes your name, email address, and payment information, which you submit on our order page when you subscribe for the Services.

(ii) Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics
=========================================================

WorldVPN collects minimal information about usage in order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service. The section below specifies in detail what information we collect. These statistics never include anything about what the user did with the VPN: no data about the contents or destinations of VPN traffic, no DNS queries, and no IP addresses.

(iii) (User-controlled option): Anonymous VPN connection diagnostics and crash reports
======================================================================================

VPN connection diagnostics are anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual WorldVPN users. This feature is similar to a “send bug report” option. Users can specify in the settings menu of any WorldVPN App whether to send these data to us.

Personal Information
====================

WorldVPN collects personal information that you provide to us directly through the Site. We require that you provide personal information, such as an email address and payment information, in order to establish an WorldVPN account, and so that we can email you, collect payments from you, and respond to support queries that you initiate. The specific information collected varies depending on the payment method you choose. To minimize the amount of personal information you submit to us, we recommend that you use Bitcoin payments when subscribing to our Service.

With some forms of payment, the Site may redirect you to the website of a third-party payment processor (namely PayPal, BitPay) to complete the transaction. To understand what personal information these processors collect and store, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policy.

WorldVPN uses your email address for the following reasons:
===========================================================

* To send emails related to payment transactions.
* To provide links to our Site, including password reset emails.
* To send you updates and announcements.
* To communicate with you about your VPN services or respond to your communications.
* To send marketing information, such as WorldVPN offers, surveys, invitations, and content about other matters in connection with WorldVPN (“Marketing emails”). You may choose to not receive Marketing emails by following the opt-out procedure described in these emails.

WorldVPN uses your personal information only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and we do not sell your personal information to third parties.

Aggregate Apps and VPN Connection Summary Statistics
====================================================

We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries. Therefore:

* We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.
* We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP addresses they used.
* We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user’s computer.

Should anyone try to compel WorldVPN to release user information based on any of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data don’t exist.

In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, WorldVPN collects the following information related to your VPN usage:

Apps and Apps versions (WorldVPN)
=================================

We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated. Knowing your current version of the Apps allows our Support Team to troubleshoot technical issues with you.

We’ve engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data. We may know THAT a customer has used WorldVPN, but we never know HOW they have utilized our Service. We stand by our firm commitment to our customers’ privacy by not possessing any data related to a user’s online activities.

Anonymous VPN Connection Diagnostics and Crash Reports (can be turned off by the user)
======================================================================================

With your permission, we collect anonymized analytics data used for network diagnostics. We use these data in our network operations tools to help optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems related to specific apps, VPN servers, or ISPs. The information we receive is fully anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual WorldVPN users (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, and we do not store IP addresses).

If you opt in to share this information with WorldVPN, we will collect the following information:

* Diagnostic information about if and how a VPN connection attempt failed.
* Speed test data.
* Crash reports, also without any personally identifiable information. These are handled in an anonymized form by these third parties, dependent on the platform you are using WorldVPN on:

* iOS: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google, and Apple. See Apple’s Privacy Policy Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation. disable Apple’s crash reporting in iOS settings as described here. Please note that if it doesn't display on your moble means its not allowed for your mobile
* Android: Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google. See Google Analytics’s Terms of Service and Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation.

Upon activation of any WorldVPN App, you will be asked if you would like to share these data. You can start or stop sharing these diagnostic data at any time in the App’s settings menu. On iOS, Apple’s crash reporting can be turned off in iOS settings.

Jurisdiction and Applicable Law
===============================

WorldVPN’s core mission is to keep your information private. We are not at all provoking any of its user to use the app for any illegal activites. Customers are using this software on his or her own liabilites. You should always abide by the law of the country you are residing

Storing of Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms
======================================================================

Depending on how you contact WorldVPN, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us. Having full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best possible customer support experience.

We use a different third-party platforms for Email Sending: Mailgun for emails. When you correspond with us using this platform, your correspondence records, including your name and email address, are stored in their systems. They utilize modern security practices and HTTPS encryption.

Security Measures to Protect Your Information
=============================================

WorldVPN uses best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information. Access to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.

While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.

Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN Services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.

Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers and manage to break its disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.
