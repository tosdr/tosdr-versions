* Automatically-collected information: We automatically collect and store certain types of information about your use of the Sites or Games.

If you publicly disclose information about yourself on any Site or Game, such content may not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein.​

​

​

Our use of cookies and tracking
-------------------------------

The Sites use cookies for gathering anonymous information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the site, and understanding how visitors use the site.

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Sites due to dependencies of functionality. 

Our use of third party analytics provider and interest-based advertising
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may host advertising on some Sites or Games, as well as embed advertising technologies from third parties. In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit the Sites or use the Games. This includes companies we’ve engaged to provide services on our behalf (like website analytics), as well as third parties that deliver content or offers (like ads from ad networks) contained on the Sites. We may receive reports from these companies on an individual or aggregate basis.

For information accessed via YouTube API Services, you can revoke any Site’s access to this information via the [Google security settings page](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1669864876119640&usg=AOvVaw0SHBXudR2oJiiRiIFjupNi) when signed into your relevant Google account. 

​

Information Security
--------------------

We use physical, technical, and organizational security safeguards to help protect your private information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. As written above, when using Google Sign-In or similar SSO technology during account creation and to authenticate you, we do not store nor control your password or password security. If you don’t utilize SSO and create a username and password on our Sites, we will encrypt your password.

However, please note that no server, communications network, or data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. The Sites are no exception. We cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted through the Sites and make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss or misuse.

It’s up to you whether you’d like to share private information with us; if you do, you’re acknowledging and agreeing that you’re doing so at your own risk. 

​

Information Retention
---------------------

Information is kept only as long as necessary for the purposes set out above (or as otherwise communicated to you); after that point, data may be kept only for statistical purposes. Note that accounts that violate the Company’s [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSO0BexD3Dkq5WEX1EIqgkDbnEuE2FJIGKKx0qcHGVSXzRLgS1sbTVwuk7IDKBnTc8JGduopPZdmXl3/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1669864876120476&usg=AOvVaw1o7-8Tru2qgP7VvwUGa-tU) or are inactive for at least six months may be purged.
