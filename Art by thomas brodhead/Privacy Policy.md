What’s Your Website Privacy Policy?
===================================

EU
--

If you are in the EU, we only use essential cookies required for site operation. No tracking cookies are used for analytics or other purposes.

Non-EU
------

If you are outside the EU, in addition to essential cookies required for site operation, we use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) to see how many visitors our site gets, what pages they visit, and how they found the site (e.g., from a Google search or from a link from another site). This helps us understand how well the site is performing and whether it needs sprucing up.

But we go an extra step: we cloak your identity by [anonymizing the data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052). That way, we only learn the fact that someone visited the site, not who it was.

Google explains their [Privacy Policy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) in detail, but you can simply [opt out of Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) altogether if you wish.
