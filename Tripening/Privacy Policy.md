Last Modified: Nov. 10th 2020 (“**Effective Date**”)

**INTRODUCTION**

This privacy policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) is designed to inform you about Tripening Inc. (“**Tripening**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information in connection with your use of Tripening services. Tripening provides online travel agency services, (the “**Services**”) for our users (“**Users**”). 

Users can access our Services through our website located at https://www.tripening.com (“**Site**”), through integrations via our API, and through our applications on their Devices. A “**Device**” is any computer used to access the Tripening Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.

**SCOPE**

This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Tripening Services, regardless of how you access it, and explains what data we collect when you use the Site and/or the Services, why we collect the data, how it is used, and your rights and choices. This policy applies to personal data and other information collected by us from or about: (i) visitors of our Site, (ii) Users, (iii) prospective clients, (iv) current clients, (v) job applicants.

By using our Site or the Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

**1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

When you interact with the Site or the Services and in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities, we collect information that alone or in combination with other information could be used to identify you (“**Personal Data**”), as described below:

**_A. Information You Provide as a User_** When you register an account as a User, you may be asked to provide Personal Data including without limitation, your name, phone number, email address, home address.

When using the Services, you may also provide us with your financial or banking information so that we are able to process your booking requests, for example to book a hotel for you.  

You may also choose to submit Personal Data to us when you send us an email or use any interactive features that we may make available on the Services. For example, you may ask us to: (a) import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (such as your email account) or (b) use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services.

You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses if you invite them to join Tripening. 

**_B. Events_** We may also collect data from you including without limitation when you attend one of our events, during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact customer support.

**_C. Employment Applications_** When you apply for employment through the Site, our provider of recruiting services will collect your resume and any additional information that you elect to provide to us, including but not limited to your employment history and education. In addition, where permitted by law, we may use a third party to carry out a background check to determine your suitability for a position.

**_D. Automatically Collected Information_**  
**i. Log Data.**

When you use the Services, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This includes the Device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, the web pages you visited before you came to the Site, the web pages you view immediately after leaving our Site, information you search for on the Site, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata, and other interactions with the Services.

We collect this information in order to deliver the Services and to provide our Users with reporting and analytics relating to the use of the Services. This information is made available to Users via the Services (for example, we provide Users with information on the use of their custom replies) and may be associated with other information about the User.

**ii. Other information collected via Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.**

We use “cookies” (small data files that we transfer to your Device) and other tracking technologies to operate and administer the Site and the Services, analyze trends and improve your access to, and use of, our Services. For more information about the cookies and similar technologies used on our Site and Services, please refer to our Cookie Policy annexed to this Privacy Policy.

**2\. HOW WE USE INFORMATION**

**_A. Provide Information; Respond to Requests_** When you ask for information about the Services (for example, when you request a demo or ask us to send you offers or price information), or register to a webinar or an event, we will use your contact information to respond to your request. Such use is necessary to respond to or implement your request.

**_B. Provide the Services to Users_** We use data provided by Users in connection with the purchase, sign-up, use, or support of the User account (such as usernames, email address and billing information) to provide you with access to the Services and/or the Site, contact you regarding your use of the Services and/or the Site, or to notify you of important changes to the Services and/or the Site. Such use is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us. To provide Users with our Services, we may share their data with third parties. 

**_C. Sending Marketing Communications and Other Announcements_** Where required by applicable law (for example, if you are an EU data subject), we will only send you marketing information by email or mail, or contact you by phone, if you consent to us doing so at the time you provide us with your Personal Data. When you provide us with your consent to be contacted for marketing purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions to “opt-out” of receiving marketing communication in each marketing email we send you. In addition, if at any time you do not wish to receive future marketing communications or wish to have your name deleted from our mailing or calling lists, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tripening.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please note that if you opt out from marketing communications, we may still contact you regarding issues related to our Services and to respond to your requests.

**_D. For Legitimate Business Interests_** We use data relating to your use of and interaction with the Site and the Services, including information that we receive through cookies and similar technologies, for certain legitimate business interests, which are the following:

* to provide, administer, and support the Site and the Services;
* to personalize and improve your access to and use of the Site and the Service (including to increase our Services’s functionality, product features, and user-friendliness);
* to verify Users have the authorization needed for the Services to process their requests;
* to inform our marketing strategy and personalize our communications with you (including providing or offering software updates, information on our features and other marketing and service-related announcements relevant to the content and features you engage with);
* to conduct analytics and report on industry trends on content usage and performance;
* to meet our corporate and social responsibility objectives;
* if you ask us to delete your data or to be removed from our marketing lists and we are required to fulfil your request, we will keep basic data to identify you and prevent further unwanted processing; and
* for internal business/technical operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, to prevent fraud or criminal activity, misuses of our products or services and ensure the security of our IT systems, architecture, and networks.

This use of your Personal Data is necessary for our legitimate interests in understanding how the Site and our Services are being used by you and to improve your experience on it.

**3\. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE**

**_B. Our Travel Partners_** We also disclose your Personal Data, if necessary, to process your request and deliver our Services, to our Travel Partners, so that we can book events, tickets, or hotel nights for you.

These third parties have access to your Personal Data for the purpose of performing these specific tasks on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.

**_C. Our AI assistant chatbot_** To provide our Services to our Users and improve our Services for a better experience, we will share your data with LiveChat. However, we anonymize this data so that no identification is possible.

These third parties may have access to your Personal Data for the purpose of performing these tasks on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.

**_C. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Tripening' Rights_** We may disclose to parties outside Tripening files stored in your Tripening account and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Tripening or its users; or (d) to protect Tripening' property rights. 

**_D. Business Transfers_** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site) of any change in control or use of your Personal Data, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.

**4\. CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION**

If you are a registered User, you may review, update or correct the Personal Data provided in your registration or account profile by changing your account settings. If your Personal Data has been shared outside of our Services by other Users of third parties and not directly by us, we cannot change or delete this Personal Data out of our control.

**5\. DATA RETENTION**

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or for our Services, for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you the Services or for the duration required by law, whichever is the longer. If you wish to delete your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you the Services, you may ask that we delete your account by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.tripening.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will then delete your Personal Data within 30 days. 

We may retain, use or disclose your information (including Personal Data) as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements, and a legitimate business interest (such as for analytics purposes, safety, and security). Consistent with and subject to these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request.

**7\. Tripening COMMUNITY**

Our Services may offer publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account.
