Below you will find the applicable cases, where we may process personal data in connection with you purchasing the license.

#### Learn more

We will also process information to support payment processing, including a payment token, which is provided by our payment service provider as a record of the transaction. When issuing our invoice, corresponding data such as an invoice ID, price paid, currency, invoice date, and tax code (e.g., VAT ID), will be collected and processed.

During each transaction, we may exchange your name, payment token, company information, payment method, contact information, and other relevant details with respective payment providers. Depending on customer’s location, different payment provider (Adyen or PPRO) may be used; Your data may also be shared with PayPal and your respective bank in order to process the payment. These details are relevant for the transaction to be completed. We only receive encrypted payment information back for the processing of new and recurring transactions, as well as from cancellation and refunds.

**Please note:** We do not process any clear payment details, such as your credit card numbers. We merely receive an encrypted piece of information in this connection. In case you do not terminate the agreement with us in accordance with termination provisions of the [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/), we will request a recurring payment using the initial payment token or transaction ID to be executed by the relevant payment provider (e.g., through the same credit card or SEPA payment details last used by you). We will only store your payment details for SEPA direct debit mandate, if you (or your company) give us an explicit consent to do so.

Where you have purchased a license through one of our partners (resellers or distributors), they will transfer personal data they have collected in the context of your purchase to TeamViewer. We will use this data to process your purchase and for continuously providing our services to you.

_The legal basis for processing this personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit b) GDPR._

##### **2\. To manage and administer contractual relationship with you**

Once you have purchased a license, we will create a corresponding license key and add it, together with information on your license’s start and expiry dates to your TeamViewer account, which you will be asked to create (please see our Product Privacy Policies for any data collected and processed when creating a TeamViewer account). During the term of the contractual relationship, we may process some personal data in order to respond to your requests or inquiries, e.g., updating contact information, issuing/re-issuing invoices, sending payment reminders, creating credit notes, general customer communication, onboarding documentation etc. Data collected in the course of any purchase will be stored and further processed in our customer relationship management system, which is facilitated by a third-party service provider (see Section D below). After you place a purchase order, you will receive a link to activate Customer Portal, where you will be able to create an account with your email-address related to TeamViewer admin account. The Customer Portal is provided by TeamViewer in order to simplify license and contract management for you, respectively for your company. There you will find information about the current subscriptions, invoices, payments and other information related to overall license and contract administration.

We may also, from time to time contact you via email or our in-product messaging service to inform you about, i.a., upcoming changes in our [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/eula/), privacy policies, product updates, security updates. In doing so, we may process your name, email-address, product information (e.g., which TeamViewer version are you using) as well as your TeamViewer ID.

For these purposes, TeamViewer may transfer your name, your company name, address, outstanding debt and other relevant contractual information to a debt collection agency. We currently cooperate with Creditreform Göppingen Engelhardt KG in this connection.

_The legal basis for all processing in this context is Art. 6 para. 1 lit b) GDPR._

##### **3\. Contacting you in connection with your use of Free Version of the software**

If you use so-called Free Version of our software in accordance with the terms of our [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/) for your personal and non-commercial purposes, we reserve the right to audit your use by technical means to assess whether your usage pattern is in line with the indicated usage volume and thus with the chosen license type (in this case, Free Version), and to detect whether the contractually agreed scope of use is being exceeded by you. Furthermore, we may require you, at any time, to provide a self-declaration regarding your actual scope of use and/or usage pattern.

To every extent possible, the described analyses will be based on pseudonymous data (e.g., we may consider your Device ID and data we have connected to your TeamViewer Device ID, rather than using immediately identifying personal data such as your name or email-address).

_We will process your personal data in this connection in order to make sure that our software is used in accordance with the EULA provisions and to exclude its misuse, therefore, the legal basis for processing this personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit b) GDPR._

##### **4\. To comply with our compliance obligations**

In order to abide with statutory compliance requirements, we conduct sanctions list checks for our customers, during which the following personal data may be processed: name, address, email address, phone number as well as respective tax ID. Personal data is checked against the sanctions lists provided by the German and European authorities.

_The legal basis for processing this personal data is, therefore, Art. 6 para. 1 lit c) GDPR._

##### **5\. To conduct fraud and security checks**

In doing so, the following personal data may be processed: name, company name, company address, email address, phone number, IP address, device fingerprint, purchase details.

We utilize external tools which allow detecting any fraudulent activities with help of pre-configured rules and patterns. Purchases identified and confirmed as frauds will be stored in our system to prevent future fraudulent transactions.

TeamViewer has a legitimate interest in protecting its business and, its users and customers from fraudulent activities by bad actors.

_The legal basis of the processing this personal data is our legitimate interest, e.g., Art. 6, para.1 lit. f) GDPR._

Through our newsletters we want to provide you with information which is most relevant and interesting for you. For this reason, we (facilitated by our data processor Inxmail GmbH) may track reactions to and interactions with emails we send you (e.g., whether you open the newsletter, click on the text and image links or display the images contained in the emails).If you sign up for our newsletter, TeamViewer processes your personal data in order to send you the newsletter.

#### C.6. When we analyze personal data

In certain cases, TeamViewer may combine and analyze certain information in the course of activities described in Sections C.2 to C.5 above together with the information available to TeamViewer internally, e.g., the use of the Software, respectively which Software have been purchased, or if a user recently started a trial of one of our products (incl. the information on your use of the product during the trial). TeamViewer conducts these analyses to decide on whether, when, and how to inform or get in touch with its customers and users. In this context, the aim is to convey relevant information about our products also in the most suitable manner, which may include in-product messages, email communications or contact by phone.

TeamViewer may also use the gathered information in order to prioritize the workload internally and to set up the processes more efficiently. Also, the analyses will assist in predicting as well as retrospectively evaluating the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts, although such analysis and reporting is mostly done on an aggregated level.

To every extent possible, the described analyses measures will be based on pseudonymous data (e.g., we may consider the Google Analytics Client ID and other non-personalized cookie data, or data we have connected to your Device ID, rather than using immediately identifying personal data such as your name or email-address).

Furthermore, TeamViewer may analyze some personal data also in connection with the Free Version software as described in Section C.4.3.

_The legal basis for processing personal data for analysis purposes are performance of or processing prior to entering into a contract (e.g., when you contact our sales team and ask for a demo), i.e., Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b), Art. 49 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, and/or our legitimate interest (e.g., when we try to find out what information about our products you might be most interested in and whether and how to best get in touch with you), i.e., Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR as long as no consent is required. For the data processing activities that require your consent, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a), Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR._

We will add the respective data point to the data available in the Google Analytics tools, and this way we use Google Analytics also for cross-device analyses of user streams.

Other tools we use in this context that are also provided by Google include:

* **Google Tag Manager** (a tag management system that allows TeamViewer to quickly and easily update tracking codes and related code fragments collectively known as “tags” on our website or mobile app);
* **Google Big Query** (an enterprise data warehouse that enables SQL queries using the processing power of Google’s infrastructure; TeamViewer uses Big Query to store and query data sets which are collected by Google services such as Google Analytics, and the Big Query data is used to build flexible reports for evaluating our website performance);

* **Google Optimize** (for A/B testing, offering to analyze user behavior by showing slightly varied website contents to different user groups, depending on profile matching; thereby, TeamViewer analyzes its online services, improves its web offerings, and can create an interesting user journey).

We strive to offer you tailored products and services that are best suited for your individual circumstances. To that end, Google provides us with insights and statistics that help us to make our online presence, our communications to you, and ultimately our products more interesting and relevant for you.

As further explained in our [Cookies Policy](https://www.teamviewer.com/privacy/#cookie-notice), you may block cookies from being stored on your device, and consequently prevent the described analyses from being conducted, by adjusting the settings in your browser software; however, in such case, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionalities of our website. You can also block the collection of the data generated by the cookie and the data related to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing a browser plugin available from the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

### 2\. Demandbase

TeamViewer uses web analytics services provided by Demandbase Inc., located at 680 Folsom Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94107 USA. Demandbase utilizes tracking technology, which includes the storing and accessing of cookies, to collect data about website visitors. Demandbase’s Tags, or JavaScript, pixels, cookies or other similar technology or code, cause a unique cookie ID to be associated with each visitor who accesses our website and may sync with third-party cookies. Demandbase’s Tags on our website may collect data on device information (such as a website visitor’s IP address), cookies, or other technical information (such as web browser type, operating system or timestamp).

### 3\. Google AdWords Conversion and Google Remarketing

TeamViewer’s website uses Google AdWords in order to generate attention for our products and services by conducting targeted advertising campaigns on third-party websites and apps. Data generated by such campaigns helps us to determine the success rate of individual campaigns. TeamViewer aims at providing you with advertisement that is of interest to you, to make its website more interesting, and calculate advertising expenses accurately.

Such means of advertisement are delivered by Google through a so-called Ad Server. Along with this, TeamViewer uses **Ad Server Cookies**, which scale certain parameters, such as display of ads or clicks by users. When you click on an ad delivered by Google that redirects you to our website, a cookie is stored on your computer by Google AdWords. These cookies usually expire within 30 days and are not supposed to be used to personally identify a user. In addition to these cookies, analytic values like a **unique cookie ID, quantity of Ad impressions per storing, last impression and opt-out information** (markings that the user does not want to be addressed any further) are usually stored. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser.

If you visit certain pages on our website and provided the cookie stored on your computer has not yet expired, TeamViewer and Google are able to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to the TeamViewer website. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Therefore, cookies cannot be tracked across different sites by TeamViewer, as is the case for all other AdWords customers. TeamViewer merely receives statistical evaluations from Google. By and through these statistical evaluations, we can evaluate which advertisement campaign was particularly effective. Any additional data generated by the particular advertisement is not forwarded to TeamViewer; particularly, we cannot personally identify users through this information.

Through this (re-)marketing tool, your browser automatically connects to Google’s servers. Please note that scope and further use of the data processed by Google are subject to Google’s privacy policy and beyond TeamViewer’s control. We thus inform you based on our own knowledge: By integrating AdWords, Google receives information that you visited a particular TeamViewer website or part thereof, and/or that you clicked on one of our advertisements. If you are registered with one of Google’s services, Google is able to match your visit to your Google account. Google may receive your IP address and/or may store it even if you are not registered with one of Google’s services and/or if you have not been logged in. You may avoid tracking in various ways, e.g. through:

* a setting of your browser software, particularly, by suppressing third party cookie installation in order to prevent receiving third-party ads;
* deactivating AdWords Cookies, by setting your browser so that cookies from www.googleadservices.com are being blocked; this can be done at [https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous](https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous), however, such settings are deleted if you delete cookies; or
* permanently deactivating cookies in your browser under [https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996).

Further information on Google’s approach to data privacy can be found under [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the advertising network initiative, by following the instructions at [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F).

In addition to Google AdWords, TeamViewer uses the tool “**Google Remarketing**.” This is an application that allows us to address you again, even when you have left our website. After visiting our website and while you are surfing the internet, our advertisement can be displayed to you by and through this application. This is enabled by cookies stored on your device, which track and analyze user behavior on different websites for Google. Google can track your previous visits to our website.

According to its own statement, Google does not combine data gathered through Remarketing with any personal data Google may have stored about you. Furthermore, the data processed for these purposes is generally limited to pseudonymous information. If you do not want to be exposed to data processing through the Google Remarketing feature, you can disable it by changing the appropriate settings at [https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous](https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous).

### 4\. Social Media Tracking Tools, including “Tracking Pixels”

We also use other tools on our website allowing us to offer you a more personalized and engaged web experience by offering you advertisements on your social media channels that are more relevant to you. To that end, we use cookie-based (please refer again to our [Cookies Policy](https://www.teamviewer.com/privacy/#cookie-notice)) tools offered by the following third-party social media providers:

* **Facebook Inc.**, 1601 S California Ave, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA; for further information on the implemented tool, please refer to [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation#base-code](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation#base-code); for additional information on data collection, refer to [https://www.facebook.com/help/186325668085084](https://www.facebook.com/help/186325668085084).
* **LinkedIn Corporation**, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA; for further information on the implemented tool and how to opt out of corresponding tracking, please refer to [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out); for further information on LinkedIn’s approach to privacy refer to: [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=uno-reg-guest-home-privacy-policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=uno-reg-guest-home-privacy-policy).
* **Twitter Inc.**, 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, California 94103, USA; for further information on the implemented tool and how to opt out of corresponding tracking, please refer to [https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads](https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/privacy-controls-for-tailored-ads); for further information on Twitter’s approach to privacy refer to: [https://twitter.com/en/privacy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy).

In each case, we integrate snippets of code provided by these social media operators that load a small library of functions (sometimes referred to as “tracking pixels”, i.e. transparent, pixel-sized images embedded in websites with a tracking functionality). These functions enable us to track your activities on our website, such as URLs visited, domains visited, device(s) used, and, in particular advertising conversions (i.e. actions counted when you interact with one of our ads, such as clicking it and purchasing our product afterwards). They rely on cookies placed by the mentioned third-party providers, which may also enable us to match our website visitors to respective user accounts on the respective social media platforms.

We may also use the “**Custom Audience**” service provided by Facebook Inc., for delivering targeted advertising to you. In this context, we would check whether you hold an account with Facebook for which you use the same email-address that you have provided to us and include you in a corresponding “custom audience” group. This works by us providing your email-address to Facebook Inc. in a hashed format, and this way making sure that Facebook will only process, as a data processor on our behalf, actual email-addresses of users that have already subscribed to their service (please refer to [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/112061095610075?id=2469097953376494&helpref=faq\_content](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/112061095610075?id=2469097953376494&helpref=faq_content) for further information on this process). You may opt-out of receiving targeted ads because you are part of a custom audience created by TeamViewer through clicking a corresponding link when you select the “Why am I seeing this?” feature on the Facebook platform (see [https://www.facebook.com/help/562973647153813?helpref=about\_content](https://www.facebook.com/help/562973647153813?helpref=about_content)).

Like many websites, TeamViewer uses “cookies” to analyze visits to our website and help us improve our website and services. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies. Please follow your browser’s process for doing so. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our websites. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purpose for which we use them, see our [Cookies Policy](https://www.teamviewer.com/privacy/#cookie-notice).

### **RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA**

Your personal data will be deleted once you withdraw consent, or, more generally, once the purpose for processing has ceased to exist. In some cases, TeamViewer is legally obligated to retain data for a certain period. Once this period has lapsed, TeamViewer will delete the data in accordance with data protection obligations.

### **CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

TeamViewer’s services are not intended for children under the age of 18. TeamViewer does not target our services to children under 18.

### **THIRD PARTY SITES**

Please note that our websites contain links to third-party websites that are not controlled or operated by TeamViewer. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that TeamViewer does not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.

### **SECURITY PRACTICES**

We take the safety of your personal data and its confidentiality very seriously and we provide reasonable security safeguards commensurate to the sensitivity of the personal data being handled and have implemented security practices including but not limited to technical, operational, and physical safeguards to protect your information. We implement a variety of security measures when entering, submitting, or accessing information to maintain the safety of your personal data. The website is scanned on a regular basis for any known vulnerabilities in order to make your use as safe as possible.

Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and it only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems or otherwise require personal data for appropriate purposes.

**Privacy Notice for TeamViewer Products**
------------------------------------------

_Version as of October 29th, 2024_

TeamViewer Germany GmbH and its affiliates take protection of your personal data very seriously. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as name, address, email-addresses, IP address, or user behavior etc. The following document (**Privacy Notice**) provides you with information about the processing of personal data in relation to your use of our Software and Services as described and defined in the [End User License Agreement](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/) (**EULA**) in connection with the use of our Software and Services (hereinafter, **Products**).

#### Learn more

On a case-by-case basis, TeamViewer may act in a different capacity in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Concrete examples of which personal data we process in which capacity are as follows:

* Personal data in connection with our agreement with you, e.g., your contact information. More information on this and how we process personal data as controllers for maintaining our contractual relationship with our users and customers can be found in our [General Privacy Notice](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/privacy-and-cookies/).
* Personal data in connection with yourTeamViewer Account (e.g., your email, password, username etc.), as well as with various TeamViewer Features, esp. initiating connections, hosting of your contact lists, or managing a team of people using our Product under your license. In this context TeamViewer may act as processors as defined under Art. 4 no. 8 GDPR. More on processing in this context can be found in our [DPA](https://www.teamviewer.com/eula/#dpa), respectively in its [Annexes](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/dpa-annex/).
* Personal data derived from your use of our Products and Services, e.g., your feedback, as well as statistical and analytical data for marketing and product development purposes. In this case TeamViewer may act as controller of such data. This Privacy Notice serves the purpose to provide more information in this context.

Below you will find more information on when, how, and why we process your personal data in connection with your use of our Products.

A. Controller
-------------

TeamViewer Germany GmbH (**TeamViewer**), Bahnhofsplatz 2, 73033 Göppingen, Germany is controller pursuant to Art. 4 para. 7 GDPR concerning any processing of personal data for which we determine the purpose and means of processing.

B. Data Protection Officer (DPO)
--------------------------------

TeamViewer appointed an external data protection officer (DPO). In addition, TeamViewer established a dedicated Privacy team, which closely collaborates with the DPO. The Privacy team as well as the DPO can be reached at [\[email protected\]](https://www.teamviewer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or at TeamViewer Germany GmbH, for the confidential attention of the DPO, Bahnhofsplatz 2, 73033 Göppingen, Germany.

C. Categories of personal data, purposes, and legal basis for the processing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### C.1. When you use TeamViewer Products  
 

##### C.1.1. Getting started  
 

When you install the Software and use the Product for the first time on a new device, we need to collect certain information from that device, such as your IP address, device’s MAC address, operating system (**OS**) specific identifier combined with other device-related information to ensure its uniqueness. From this information, TeamViewer creates a unique Machine ID (**MID**), from which the TeamViewer master infrastructure generates the TeamViewer Device ID (**TeamViewer ID**), which in turn allows it to distinguish between unique user devices that have the Software installed.

When you sign up for a TeamViewer account, TeamViewer collects your name, email-address, a password of your choice, along with time, date, and time zone of you signing in and creates a unique TeamViewer Account ID for your TeamViewer account.

Should you choose to add the additional security option of two factor authentication to your account, TeamViewer will process the data required to provide this option and to maintain your accounts security including: Number of login attempts, location and whether the session is active, Mobile phone number, TeamViewer ID.

TeamViewer requires the Edge WebView2 Runtime by Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. (One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland) (**Microsoft**) for the user interface. If not already installed, it will be downloaded and installed when you click ‘Accept – next’. The Edge WebView2 Runtime may collect information and send it to Microsoft to provide services as described in Microsoft’s Privacy Statement at [https://aka.ms/privacy](https://aka.ms/privacy).

#### Learn more

During the installation, we will also ask you whether (i) you would like to explore the full-featured business trial, (ii) if you wish to only use the Product for personal use, or, (iii) if you already have a license. According to your choice, you may be directed to our license trial page, or you may continue with software installation process. During so, if you decide to sign up for a TeamViewer Account, we will collect your name, email-address, a password of your choice, along with time, date, and time zone of you signing in and create a unique TeamViewer Account ID for your TeamViewer Account.

In some countries we may ask our users to provide their phone numbers for identification purposes. This may be done for the purposes of strengthening our security and ensuring proper authentication.

Furthermore, TeamViewer may process your personal data for the purposes of license management. When a customer activates the license with help of the license sync option, TeamViewer license server checks the information to assign the license to the correct customer. In doing so, some personal data may be processed, such as license information (e.g., license ID, roles and permissions, type), system information (e.g., license key, server configuration), user information (e.g., email-address, IP address, status, language, organization) or session information (ID, security tokens, IP address, username device, etc.).

TeamViewer is processing personal data in connection with license management in order to assign you the required license, and, consequently, for the performance of the contract with you.

_The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._ 

##### C.1.2. Social Login Services  
 

You also have the option to create or log in into a TeamViewer account via an identity provider, e.g., Microsoft, Google Ireland Ltd. (Gorden House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, etc.) (**Google**). This makes it easier for you to register for our Products. Through this, we offer you the possibility to register or log in into a TeamViewer account via an identity provider to use our Products.

If you use an identity provider, you will be forwarded to the identity provider’s page. There you can create an account or log in with an already existing account via your user data. The identity provider will ask for your consent to release certain information about your account to us. This data is collected by the identity provider and transmitted to us by the identity provider in compliance with the relevant provisions of the privacy notice. TeamViewer receives an identification token from the identity provider that contains information used to create, or connect to, your account (username and e-mail-address). TeamViewer will process the email-address and username received from this identity provider for registration and login to your account. To carry out this authentication process, your IP address is transmitted to the respective identity provider. We have no influence on the purpose and scope of the data collection and on the further processing of the data by the identity provider. For more information, please read the privacy policy of the respective provider. By using the login via an identity provider, you agree to this data transfer to us. TeamViewer will also directly collect from you some of the information needed for providing the account (as described above, C.1.1.). You can prevent the processing of your data by the respective identity provider by not using the identity provider but using our own registration form and signing up for a TeamViewer account.

_The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in connection with an identity provider is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR._ 

##### C.1.3. Conducting remote connections  
 

Whenever you run the TeamViewer Software client, the TeamViewer master server infrastructure will register whether the device is available for a connection session with other devices. To achieve that, it collects and processes your IP address, your location, TeamViewer ID, the MID, and your chosen user screen name. While trying to connect to another device, this data is exchanged between the TeamViewer master server infrastructure, selected TeamViewer routers, and the Software client of your envisaged connection partner. In addition, our servers will automatically collect certain remote connection metadata (so called logs, which can later be used to address and analyze technical bugs and difficulties).

#### Learn more

The decision on which connection paths are used, in particular which routing servers, depends on the analysis of this data, considering e.g., geography and current workload on individual routers. Once you successfully connect to another device and thus establish a remote control or other session with your connection partner, certain session metadata such as a remote connection (session) ID will be collected and processed.

_The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._

##### C.1.4. Using Text recognition feature (Frontline and Assist AR)  

Functionalities of Frontline and Assist AR include, amongst others, a text recognition feature. It is based on the use of a text recognition API provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, United States (**Google LLC**), that also enables the activation of the Optical Character Recognition (**OCR**) functionality on smart glasses used with Frontline and Assist AR. If technically possible, the API contacts Google LLC's servers from time to time in order to receive things like bug fixes, updated models and hardware accelerator compatibility information. It may also send telemetry data about the performance and utilization of the API in the Assist AR App to Google LLC. Such data include device information, application information, device or other identifiers, performance metrics, API configuration, event type and error codes (you can find further information here). Google LLC uses this data to measure performance, debug, maintain and improve the API, and detect misuse or abuse, as further described in Google’s Privacy Policy.

_The legal basis to process this personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._ 

##### C.1.5. Adding devices to your account  
 

When you add so called managed devices to your TeamViewer account, we activate these devices as endpoints that are assigned to your license. To achieve that, TeamViewer collects, and processes certain data associated with those managed devices, e.g., screen name, TeamViewer ID, MID, email-address, TeamViewer Account ID, TeamViewer License ID and, if mobile device management is purchased: location data, and mobile device data. During the activation of an endpoint TeamViewer needs to ensure that the Product is used in accordance with the EULA and Product Specifications.

This is done to assign and enforce the license limits as agreed with you under your contract.

_The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._ 

##### C.1.6. Using the Backup feature  
 

If you choose to use our optional feature Backup, we may process the information on your purchased storage limits in order to assign you the relevant storage space and, in case the limit is reached, inform you of the storage limitation. Furthermore, we may process the information on your location, since your location is the determining factor when deciding the storage location for your personal data (e.g., if you are located within the European Union, you will be assigned the cloud in Europe).

We process certain information in order to manage your account and provide you Backup services under the contractual agreement with you.

_The legal basis to process this personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._ 

##### C.1.7. Using add-ons  
 

If you use add-ons (e.g., the security services provided by Malwarebytes Inc., the mobile device management provided by Ivanti UK Ltd. or the asset management and discovery provided by Lansweeper NV) we may process certain license information, your name, email address username, IP address, your device information and similar in order to activate your license and respectively link it to your TeamViewer Account.  

_The legal basis to process this personal data described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._ 

##### C.1.8. Product improvement and technical support  
 

TeamViewer may process personal data to analyze server and device logs in order to identify vulnerabilities, crashes as well as other issues to consequently mitigate or fix them. During such analysis certain information that may include personal data is analyzed, such as the user information (e.g., email, IP address, status, language, organization), session ID, TeamViewer ID, call or workflow data, license data, call ID, workflow information (ID, title, etc.), multimedia assets (e.g., type of the asset, ID, name etc.), information related to certain task (ID; name, comment, creation date etc.), or picking information (order ID, shelf location, status etc.). We are processing your personal data in connection with product improvement activities in order to provide you with better and improved services, and, consequently, for the enhancement of the contract with you.

Please note that TeamViewer has put additional technical and organizational measures in place, e.g., pseudonymization as well as further strong technical and organizational measures to ensure security of the data. It is also important to note that we never access any content or connection data itself, but rather observe your interactions with our Software and Services.

For product improvement purposes, the overall usage patterns of TeamViewer Products are analyzed, e.g., information about how certain features of the Product and the Server Services are used, as well as the interactions. This may include the session metadata, feature usage (e.g., remote control, file transfer, settings, etc.), and how frequently they are being used. This information helps improve and further develop TeamViewer Products, e.g., to help decide whether certain functionalities of the Product shall be kept, amended, or improved, or whether to create new features or improve the design. Please note, that TeamViewer only assesses the interactions and at no point information or data that is being exchanged between you and your connection partner(s).

TeamViewer may analyze this data together with further information submitted to us, as further described under this Product Privacy Notice, as well as in our [General Privacy Notice](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/privacy-and-cookies/).

_The legal basis to process this personal data described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._ 

##### C.1.9. Analyzing and fixing crashes in mobile applications  
 

TeamViewer may process your personal data to analyze crashes in mobile applications. This is done only if the customer enables the automatic log of crashes. In such case, all crash logs are sent to TeamViewer server where they are analyzed, and bug fixes are implemented. Such crash logs may contain information on relevant sessions (ID, security tokens, IP address, username device, etc.), as well as device information (ID, device name, IP address, application version, device logs) or user information (e.g., email, IP address, status, language, organization).

_The legal basis to process this personal data described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._

##### C.1.10. Using our AI Services  
  

If you choose to use TeamViewer’s AI Services, you or your company’s administrator need to activate them. In this case, we may process your activation to the services. We deployed AI features within the AI Services from third parties to provide a better experience, and use of these features may involve us processing any personal data submitted to them. We recommend that users do not submit sensitive or confidential information. 

_The legal basis of this processing is fulfillment of the terms and conditions for the AI Services, i.e., Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._

We may use the data collected from your input, usage, interactions, outputs and feedback of the AI Services for product improvement purposes, including the enhancement and development of features and functionalities. This purpose does not comprise processing of personal data. We therefore de-identify session data by removing personal data on behalf of the customer as far as possible to prevent that personal data is processed by us. However, it cannot be excluded that after the de-identification there may still be some personal data left. TeamViewer has put additional technical and organizational measures in place, e.g., pseudonymization as well as further strong encryption measures to ensure the security of the data so that only a randomized ID will be processed by us for technical reasons. This way we ensure that the session data is de-identified and that there is no longer a connection to the session participants. 

_Legal basis of this processing described in this section is our legitimate interest as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Processing is in the legitimate interests of both TeamViewer and our Customers, in order to enhance the users’ experience and to provide a more accurate and reliable service to our Customers and Users._ 

#### C.2. Ensuring your security and that of others

The security of our customers, users and employees is extremely important for TeamViewer. To achieve these purposes, TeamViewer has implemented a number of processes and procedures, so that fraudulent or suspicious activities are identified, and TeamViewer may take appropriate action. These measures also serve the prevention of abuse and fraud by identifying abnormal or unexpected usage. To do so, we need to evaluate the usage of the Software in order to recognize abusive or abnormal patterns and thus to help protect our network and service integrity at any time. Doing so, we may process certain personal data, e.g., data associated with your remote connections, IP addresses, derived locations, various user interactions and patterns as well as device information (e.g., TeamViewer IDs). These processes are intended primarily to achieve the above aim i.e., to protect stakeholders as well as TeamViewer’s interests.

Subject to the Product, our users and customers also have the possibility to partake in the connection risk scoring (beta feature), which provides alerts within the Software on the possibly suspicious behavior of your connection partners. For these purposes, the results of our risk analysis are being used.

We will share information about the connecting user’s account with the recipient to establish that the connection is trusted. The user account data may include displayed country, domain of e-mail address, license status, age of account, VPN usage, etc.

If you believe we have blocked you and your devices in error, please contact our [customer support](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/global/support/customer-support/) in order to unblock your access.

_The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section is, performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, or our legitimate interest and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR._

#### C.3. Conducting license audits

We may analyze your use of the Product and/or Server Services for security purposes, as well as for license auditing. To that end, we may use, and implement technical measures regarding the functionality of the Product and the Server Services to assess whether your usage pattern is in line with the indicated usage volume and thus with the chosen license type, and to detect whether the contractually agreed scope of use is being exceeded by customers or users in individual cases.

_The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._

##### C.3.1. Free Version  
 

If you are using our so-called Free Version of the Software as defined in the [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/), we may analyze your Product usage data in accordance with Sections A.1, B.1.1, B.2.2, as well as B.1.8 of our [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/) to assess whether your usage pattern is in line with your indicated usage purpose and thus with the chosen license type. This assessment, which may also include an analysis of the domain of an email-address you have provided in the course of signing up for a TeamViewer Account (see above Section C.1.1), will result in a so called “commercial score”. Depending on this score, we may determine that a fee-based license, as opposed to a Free Version, is required for your usage pattern of our Product, and we will inform you accordingly.

If you continue to use our Product in a way that indicates a violation of Section B.1.8 of the [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/), we may limit or ultimately block your access to the Server Services and ask you to purchase a fee-based license. In certain cases, this may involve an automatic decision-making process, where TeamViewer systems are configured to automatically put in place a limitation or even a blocking of your use of the Product.

If you think you are using our Product within the scope of the Free Version license, you may submit a corresponding request by way of our online form, for which we ask you to submit your name, email-address, affected TeamViewer ID, and an explanation on your usage. TeamViewer will then analyze your submission and again evaluate your detected usage patterns. In the course of the evaluation process, we may also ask you to submit a declaration confirming your use of our Product for private, non-commercial purposes only. For this declaration, we may ask you to submit your name, postal address, explanation of your usage, and your signature.  
 

##### C.3.2. Paid license  
 

If you have purchased our paid license, we may from time to time monitor your use of our services for license audit purposes, especially, to check whether your use of the Software and its features is in line with your license scope. If we determine any discrepancies and especially, the overuse, we may notify you via in-product messaging and ask you to discontinue the overuse or alternatively, purchase additional licenses.

Please refer to Section B.1.4 of the [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/) in this connection.

If you will not discontinue the overuse or purchase additional licenses, we may block your Server Services until the dispute is resolved or terminate the agreement with you.

We may also process certain personal data in connection with your payments. In case of the payment defaults, in addition to sending out payment reminders, we may block your Software and Server Services in accordance with our [EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/eula/), as well as involve external debt collection agency.

#### C.4. Support and Feedback  
 

##### C.4.1. Processing your feedback  
 

When you provide feedback concerning your experience when using TeamViewer Products (e.g. through our [User Focus Program](https://ufp.teamviewer.com/landing), rating our products, or by reporting bugs or feature requests), we will collect and process your TeamViewer Account ID (if you provide the feedback while logged-in), your country and language settings, as well as any information you submit in your inquiry  or rating (including attachments such as log files or screen shots), which may contain your email-address, your name, company information, phone number, license key, or your TeamViewer ID. You may also provide us with logs stored on your local device for analytical purposes. In such case we will only process your data for the purposes of resolving the issue.

In the User Focus Program, any information disclosed in a survey, interview or recording may be processed in connection with product improvement activities. This may contain your email address, your name, company information, phone number, license key, audio and/or video recordings and TeamViewer Account ID.

The legal basis to process your personal data as described under this Section, is performance of our contract with you (i.e., the EULA) and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, our legitimate interest and thus as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR or your consent as defined in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR_

##### C.4.2. Providing technical support

##### C.4.3. Bug Bounty Program (selected Products)  
 

We embrace any responsible disclosure in order to make our Products and Services better. Therefore, we offer a clear guideline for ethical hackers by providing a [VDP](https://vdp.teamviewer.com/#/page/0/Index) (Vulnerability Disclosure Policy) for selected Products which are subject to our choice. Our aim is to challenge ourselves by allowing you to investigate and discover various bugs or vulnerabilities pertaining to security exploits of our software.

You may participate in the so-called bug bounty or similar program anonymously. However, if you decide to submit your personal data, we may process it in order to properly identify you (e.g., your name, last name, pseudonym) as well as your contact information (e.g., email-address, postal address, phone number), your credentials, your country of residence and other personal information, as submitted by you.

The purpose of the processing is to work with you in order to resolve the bug and any associated topics around it. As mentioned above, you may also participate within the program anonymously.

_The legal basis of this processing is fulfillment of the participation terms and conditions, i.e., Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR._

In determining whether and how we contact our customers and users, we may also process the license type, language and version of the Product, and/or country, and we may also draw on data we have gathered through analyses measures as described in Section C.5 of this Privacy Notice as well as Section C.6. of [our General Privacy Notice](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/privacy-and-cookies/).

It also tells you how you can manage or delete the Cookies that are stored on your device or manage the use of Cookies.

A. Controller
-------------

TeamViewer Germany GmbH (“**TeamViewer**”), Bahnhofsplatz 2, 73033 Göppingen, Germany is controller pursuant to Art. 4 para. 7 General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”) concerning any processing of personal data for which we determine the purpose and means of processing.

C. All about the Cookies
------------------------

#### C.1. What are the Cookies?

Cookies are small text files containing information related to your internet settings, which are downloaded by your browser to the device you use when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website (first-party Cookies) on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that Cookie (third-party Cookies). Cookies perform a variety of useful jobs, such as remembering your preferences, adapting the content that you see and improving your online experience.

#### C.2. When and how does TeamViewer place Cookies?

TeamViewer uses Cookies on its websites (such as teamviewer.com, login.teamviewer.com, teamViewerIOT.com, and other TeamViewer sub-domains such as login.teamviewer.com, get.teamviewer.com, www.lifear.com) and applications. Any device with which you are visiting these websites will receive at least some Cookies from TeamViewer, depending on the consent that you give when first visiting our website or changing your Cookie preferences at a later stage.

When you visit our websites for the first time with a specific device, we will ask you to choose your preferences through our Cookie banner (“**Banner**”). Within the Banner you can make a choice according to your wishes, either allowing us to set certain or all Cookies by category, limiting the setting of the Cookies or not selecting any at all. Please note, however, that some Cookies will always be active, and we do not ask for your consent for these. This applies for “strictly necessary” Cookies, because – as their name suggests – we need to place them for the proper functioning of our website (see also Strictly Necessary Cookies section below).

_The legal basis for the collection and processing of personal data in this case is, therefore, your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a), Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR or our legitimate interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR respectively._

#### Learn more

If you are using the Free Version software as defined in our EULA and Product Specifications, we may place certain third-party Cookies (e.g., Google Analytics) on your device regardless of your preferences based on contract pursuant to Section B.2.2 of our EULA. As specified in our EULA, a key element of and part of the product specification for the Free Version software is the display and receipt of personalized marketing messages in the software as well as the processing of personal data necessary to provide such personalization. In this context, we set certain cookies which enables TeamViewer to analyze your product usage as well as your browsing behavior on our websites. In doing so, we may assess your product usage history (e.g., how long or how often have you been using TeamViewer), how you interacted with our in-product messages, how often have you visited our websites or which pages have you looked at. This information then will help us determine the offers that are, in our opinion, most relevant for you on our website, ads or through in-product-messages.

Otherwise, you can change your preferences at any time in our Cookie Settings.

#### C.3. What types of Cookies are being used?

There are different types of Cookies used web-wide, that differ from each other by the various criteria, aims as well as the purposes. TeamViewer, as many other companies in the world, utilizes different sets of Cookies depending on which purpose we are pursuing. TeamViewer uses i.e., functional and strictly necessary Cookies in order to make our websites function properly and to display contents in accordance with your location (e.g., language settings), and we also use marketing and retargeting Cookies, e.g., Google Ads or Google Analytics.

#### Learn more

#### Different types regarding the provider of the Cookie

TeamViewer uses both, first- and third-party Cookies. First party Cookies are those set by TeamViewer itself. All other Cookies are third party Cookies, from companies such as Google Analytics, Facebook, LinkedIn etc. In some cases, the information derived from these Cookies may allow us to associate information with an identifiable individual, i.e., personal data.

#### Different types regarding the duration of storage  
 

##### **Session Cookies** 

Session Cookies last only for the duration of your visit of our website and are deleted when you close your browser. These help us to identify that a user of a particular device is navigating from page to page, supporting website security or basic functionality. Many of the Cookies we use are session Cookies. For example, they help us to measure the average time you spend on our website.  
 

##### **Persistent Cookies** 

Persistent Cookies continue to exist even after you have closed your browser and allow a website to remember your actions and preferences, particularly remember you as an existing user. Sometimes persistent Cookies are used by websites to provide targeted advertising based upon the browsing history of the device. TeamViewer uses persistent Cookies in a few ways, for example to distinguish users of our website and/or our products.

#### Different types regarding the purpose of use

Both session as well as persistent Cookies can serve different purposes and may be placed either by TeamViewer or by a third party. We differentiate between _strictly necessary Cookies, performance Cookies, functional Cookies, and marketing and targeting Cookies._ 

##### **a) Strictly necessary Cookies** 

These Cookies are essential in order to enable us to provide you with basic and security features of our website. Without these Cookies, certain services you have asked for cannot be provided, such as the use of areas of our website that are restricted to registered users (a Cookie, which identifies registered users to recognize them throughout the visit and upon return, e.g., within the login area of our Management Console) and webshop related services. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. These Cookies are not implemented to gather information about you for other purposes such as marketing or analytics.  
 

##### **b) Performance cookies** 

These Cookies are used to collect information about the performance of our website and your visit and use of our website, for example, the number of visitors that used our website and the pages that are popular among our visitors. These Cookies do not collect information that directly identifies a visitor, although they may collect the IP address of the device used to access the site. Such information is used for the purpose of improving our website and the general user experience. Without the performance Cookies we will not be able to improve our website and its functionalities to provide you with the best surfing experience. If you do not allow these Cookies, your visit to our site will not be counted, which will negatively impact us when trying to improve our website.  
 

##### **c) Functional Cookies** 

These Cookies allow TeamViewer’s website to remember your preferences, such as your username, language settings, and/or the region you are in. These Cookies help to provide enhanced, more personal features. They can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize or provide services you have asked for such as watching a video, using the chat functionality or commenting on a blog. These Cookies do not track your browsing activity across other websites.  
 

##### **d) Marketing and Targeting Cookies** 

These Cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These Cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations, such as media publishers. These organizations do this in order to provide you with targeted adverts more relevant to you and your interests. This type of advertising is called online behavioral advertising. Furthermore, these Cookies allow us to analyze your website browsing behavior and thus allows us to customize our product marketing approach, e.g., help us decide on whether, when, and how to inform or get in touch with you based on your interests.

D. Is personal data about you processed through Cookies?
--------------------------------------------------------

Not all Cookies collect and process personal data about you. Instead, anonymous data may be used in many cases. In certain instances, however, Cookies will help us and our partners to collect and process personal data. Below sections will tell you more about the applicable categories of personal data and the purposes of the collection and processing that occur in this context. In general, it can be said that the data serves to provide the best possible experience to you when you use our websites and products and to further business interests of TeamViewer.

Please note that you can stop such collection and processing of personal data the same way you can stop the use of Cookies in general (see more under the Cookie Settings).

#### D.1. Personal data processed through web analytics and (re-)marketing applications

TeamViewer uses various web analytic applications and (re-)marketing tools, social media plugins, as well as third party integrated services. By and through these applications and tools, personal data as set out in this Cookie Notice are collected and may be combined with other personal data, we may collect from you.  
 

##### **1\. Google Analytics and other analysis tools provided by Google** 

TeamViewer uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA / Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, 4 Barrow Street, Dublin, Ireland, or any other Affiliate of Google LLC (“**Google**“). When you visit our website for the first time and consent to our use of Cookies, you will be assigned a cookie with a unique user identification, i.e., a Google Analytics Client ID depending on your Cookie settings.

TeamViewer uses Google Analytics with the extension “anonymizeIp()”. Thereby, IP addresses are processed in a shortened form. The information generated by cookies about your use of this website is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the USA. Only in exceptional circumstances will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of the Google Analytics data collection will not be merged with other data from Google.

_The legal basis to conduct and use the results of these analyses is your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a), Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR._

Other tools TeamViewer uses in this context that are also provided by Google include:

* Google Tag Manager (a tag management system that allows TeamViewer to quickly and easily update tracking codes and related code fragments, collectively known as “tags” on our website or mobile app);
* Google Big Query (an enterprise data warehouse that enables SQL queries using the processing power of Google’s infrastructure; TeamViewer uses Big Query to store and query data sets which are collected by Google services such as Google Analytics, and the Big Query data is used to build flexible reports for evaluating our website performance);

##### **2\. Security and identification** 

TeamViewer may use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter “reCAPTCHA”) on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”).

reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form or log-in area) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.

For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google’s privacy policy, please visit Google information pages linked [here](https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/) and [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html).

_The legal basis for the data processing in this connection is the legitimate interest of TeamViewer, Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR, since we have a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam_.  
 

##### **3\. (Re-)Marketing/retargeting applications** 

##### **a) Google AdWords Conversion and Google Remarketing** 

TeamViewer uses Google AdWords in order to generate attention for our products and services by conducting targeted advertising campaigns on third-party websites and apps. Data generated by such campaigns helps us to determine the success rate of individual campaigns. We aim at providing you with advertisement that is of interest to you, to make its website more interesting, and calculate advertising expenses accurately.

_The legal basis for such processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a), Art. 49 para 1 lit. a) GDPR, therefore, your consent._

#### Learn more

TeamViewer uses Ad Server Cookies, which scale certain parameters, such as display of ads or clicks by users. When you click on an ad delivered by Google that redirects you to our website, a cookie is stored on your computer by Google AdWords. These cookies usually expire within 30 days and are not supposed to be used to personally identify a user. In addition to these cookies, analytic values like a unique cookie ID, quantity of Ad impressions per storing, last impression and opt-out information (markings that the user does not want to be addressed any further) are usually stored. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser.

If you visit certain pages on our website and provided the cookie stored on your device has not yet expired, we as well as Google are able to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to our website. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Therefore, cookies cannot be tracked across different sites by TeamViewer, as is the case for all other AdWords customers. We merely receive statistical evaluations from Google. By and through these statistical evaluations, we can evaluate which advertisement campaign was particularly effective. Any additional data generated by the particular advertisement is not forwarded to TeamViewer; particularly, we cannot personally identify users through this information.

Through this (re-)marketing tool, your browser automatically connects to Google’s servers. Please note that scope and further use of the data processed by Google are subject to Google’s privacy policy and beyond TeamViewer’s control. We thus inform you based on our own knowledge:

By integrating AdWords, Google receives information that you visited a particular TeamViewer website or part thereof, and/or that you clicked on one of our advertisements. If you are registered with one of Google’s services, Google is able to match your visit to your Google account. Google may receive your IP address and/or may store it even if you are not registered with one of Google’s services and/or if you have not been logged in.

You may avoid tracking in various ways, e.g. through a setting of your browser software, particularly, by suppressing third party cookie installation in order to prevent receiving third-party ads; deactivating AdWords Cookies, by setting your browser so that cookies from www.googleadservices.com are being blocked; this can be done at https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous, however, such settings are deleted if you delete cookies; or permanently deactivating cookies in your browser under https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996.

Further information on Google’s approach to data privacy can be found under https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the advertising network initiative, by following the instructions at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/.

In addition to Google AdWords, TeamViewer uses the tool “Google Remarketing”. This is an application that allows us to address you again, even when you have left our website. After visiting our website and while you are surfing the internet, our advertisement can be displayed to you by and through this application. This is enabled by cookies stored on your device, which track and analyze user behavior on different websites for Google. Google can track your previous visits to our website.

According to its own statement, Google does not combine data gathered through Remarketing with any personal data Google may have stored about you. Furthermore, the data processed for these purposes is generally limited to pseudonymous information. If you do not want to be exposed to data processing through the Google Remarketing feature, you can disable it by changing the appropriate settings at https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous.

##### **b) Social media tracking tools, including “tracking pixels”** 

We may also use other tools on our website allowing us to offer you a more personalized and engaged web experience by offering you advertisements on your social media channels that are more relevant to you. To that end, we use cookie-based tools offered by the following third-party social media providers:

In each case, we integrate snippets of code provided by these social media operators that load a small library of functions (sometimes referred to as “tracking pixels”, i.e., transparent, pixel-sized images embedded in websites with a tracking functionality). These functions enable us to track your activities on our website, such as URLs visited, domains visited, device(s) used, and, in particular, advertising conversions (i.e., actions counted when you interact with one of our ads, such as clicking it and purchasing our product afterwards). They rely on cookies placed by the mentioned third-party providers, which may also enable us to match our website visitors to respective user accounts on the respective social media platforms.

Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, for example your name, address, email addresses, number of shares, the information which intermediary bank you are using.

A. Controller
-------------

TeamViewer SE, Bahnhofsplatz 2, 73033 Göppingen, [\[email protected\]](https://www.teamviewer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), is controller of your personal data pursuant to Art. 4 para. 7 General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”).

B. Data Protection Officer (DPO)
--------------------------------

C. Purpose of processing and respective legal basis
---------------------------------------------------

TeamViewer SE collects and processes different categories of personal data depending on the relevant purpose of the use, especially in connection with the management of investor and shareholder relations. The following sections outline the categories of data processed by us and respective purposes for such processing. If the legal basis for a processing is your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, such withdrawal however will not have any impact on the legitimacy of the processing itself prior to withdrawal of your consent.

### I. Management of investor relations

We may process your personal data collected at the events or roadshows, such as your name and contact information, as well as in connection with our Investor Relations News Alert (in case you have subscribed to it) or if you decide to get in touch with us via email or phone. Legal basis for the processing is your consent, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (a) GDPR or our legitimate interest, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to answer your questions, provide information and maintain our investor relations.

### II. Processing of personal data of shareholders and their representative

We may process your personal data such as your name, contact information, your email address, your representative, your intermediary bank, number of shares in connection with you purchasing shares in TeamViewer SE. Such information is used to fulfil our legal obligations (e.g. inform the regulatory bodies if shareholders reach certain levels of share ownership) as well as organize annual shareholder meetings (“**Shareholder Meeting**”), including but not limited to preparing and sending out the invitations, issuing voting cards or respectively voting right tickets, compiling the list of participants and processing the power of attorneys. Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.

### III. Processing of personal data in connection with Shareholder Meetings

We may conduct our Shareholder Meetings either in person or without presence using the means of remote communication (“**virtual Shareholder Meeting**”) with the option of participating by an electronic connection.

In order to enable shareholders and their representatives to participate in the Shareholder Meeting (e.g. by checking their eligibility to participate) and to exercise their rights at the Shareholder Meeting (including granting and revoking powers of attorney and instructions) as well as to ensure a proper conduct of the Shareholder Meeting, the observance of voting bans, the lawful adoption of resolutions and evaluation of cast votes at the Shareholder Meeting, we may process the name, contact information, registration number, number of shares, voting behavior and results, submitted questions, statements (in writing or via video message), motions, counter-motions, nominations, instructions and objections of our shareholders and their representatives, and login information for our designated shareholder portal (shareholder/voting card number and password). Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.

The entire Shareholder Meeting may be broadcast live and publicly accessible on the Internet by means of video and audio transmission. If the Shareholder Meeting is conducted in person and you enter the recording area or make a verbal contribution during recording activities, this live broadcast will include your appearance and verbal contribution. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to enable interested shareholders and the public to follow the Shareholder Meeting via the Internet in accordance with the express permission in the German Stock Corporation Act and our by-laws.

Insofar as we take down in shorthand your verbal contributions during the Shareholder Meeting without being legally obliged to do so, this is done to ensure the proper conduct of the Shareholder Meeting and to be able to deal with your questions and motions. The stenographic minutes will not be published. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to ensure that the Shareholder Meeting is executed properly and that our shareholders’ participation rights can be realized in the best possible way.

If you make use of the opportunity to submit questions, statements (in writing or via video message), motions, counter-motions, nominations or other requests that are dealt with or made available during or before the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name, which other participants of the Shareholder Meeting may take note of. If we are not legally obliged to state your name in this context, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to inform the other shareholders of the name of the applicant.

### IV. Processing of personal data in connection with the shareholder portal

If we conduct the Shareholder Meeting virtually, the shareholders and their representatives will not be able to physically attend the meeting. They can, however, follow the entire meeting via video and audio transmission through the designated shareholder portal. In connection with the virtual Shareholder Meeting we will process your voting card number, log-in password, type of the power of attorney and personal data of your representative, as well as the instructions issued in connection with the Shareholder Meeting and any other information submitted by you in the shareholder portal. Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.

If we conduct a virtual Shareholder Meeting and provide the shareholder portal to enable you to conveniently manage your shareholder data, we will collect and process certain personal data on the web server log files, when you visit our shareholder portal in order to log in to attend the virtual Shareholder Meeting, manage your shareholder data or exercise your shareholder’s rights:

* Date and time of the request
* Notification whether the request was successful
* Requested URL
* Referrer URL (the previously visited page), if your browser sends this information
* Type of used web browser and operating system used
* IP address
* Port by which the access was made
* Actions performed within the portal
* Session ID and data
* Successful logins and logouts with the time stamp

Your browser automatically transfers this data to us when you visit our shareholder portal.

Legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR, since we have a legitimate interest in making the shareholder portal available to you and your representatives so that you can exercise your shareholder rights in a user-friendly manner and participate in the virtual Shareholder Meeting.

D. Cookies
----------

If we use cookies in the provision of the shareholder portal, we will only do so if this is necessary for the operation of the shareholder portal or if you have given your consent. In this case, when you visit the shareholder portal, we will inform you in a pop-up window about our cookies and associated data processing before using cookies and, if necessary, ask you for your voluntary consent.

E. Data Sources
---------------

If you are a shareholder, we receive your personal data either directly from you or from the custodian credit institutions or intermediaries who are involved in the deposit of shares you purchased.

If you act as representative of a shareholder, we receive your personal data from the shareholder who granted you the power of attorney and directly from you as far as your behavior during the Shareholder Meeting or your use of the shareholder portal is concerned.

F. Recipients
-------------

TeamViewer SE’s employees, who administer, maintain and manage our internal processes, will have access to your personal data. To that end, TeamViewer SE has strong technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized disclosure to third parties and to ensure that only relevant individuals, who act within their job description and have a need-to-know interest in accessing any of your personal data, will have access to the data for which they have sufficient clearance.

Aside from TeamViewer SE’s employees, your personal data may be processed by employees of third-party services providers, who assist us in our daily business, such as providers of IT operation and maintenance services, (cloud) storage service providers and providers of (cloud) collaboration tools, as well as PR agencies. We use certain service providers in order to provide services typical for the capital market, such as EQS Group AG and Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. for the management of investor relations as well as Link Market Services GmbH for the management of shareholder relations and Shareholder Meetings. Link Market Services GmbH also operates the shareholder portal used for organizing virtual Shareholder Meetings, exclusively on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.

TeamViewer SE selects all third-party service providers with due care, obligates them to confidentiality, and concludes data processing agreements (DPAs) with them (including the providers listed above) in accordance with the standards of the GDPR, as applicable. Should you have any questions about third parties we use, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.teamviewer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

In addition to above cases, your personal data may also be disclosed during or in connection with the Shareholder Meetings. If you, as a shareholder, make use of the opportunity to submit questions and your questions are dealt with during the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name. The above applies likewise regarding the submission of statements (in writing or via video message), the publication of which will show your name and, in the case of a statement via video message, images of yourself. If you submit items for the agenda, motions, counter-motions or nominations that we have to make publicly available, e.g. on our company’s website, before the Shareholder Meeting pursuant to our obligations under stock corporation law, this will also generally be done by stating your name. Other participants of the Shareholder Meeting or even the public may take note of this. Furthermore, other shareholders, their representatives where applicable or other participants of the meeting can view the personal data contained in the participant list during the Shareholder Meeting and, if applicable, up to two years thereafter in accordance with Sec. 129 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

TeamViewer SE will generally not transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, which include data transfers for group internal IT services provided from outside the EU, including Australia, USA and Armenia. TeamViewer SE will otherwise transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA only when required to do so by law or in case of orders from a competent authority. Currently we transfer personal data to our provider Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. in the US. Legal basis for such transfer is a DPA with EU standard contractual clauses.

Whenever TeamViewer SE transfers your personal data out of the EU or the EEA to countries that do not have an adequate level of data protection recognized by the EU, we will apply safeguards to adequately protect your personal data. In particular, we will conclude standard contractual clauses with corresponding entities and /.

We will not share your personal data with local authorities or courts except where we are required to do so by applicable law, a court order or a legally binding injunction. We may be obliged to pass on your personal data to other recipients, such as when publishing voting rights notifications in accordance with the provisions of the German Securities Trading Act, or to authorities in order to comply with statutory notification obligations (e.g. to financial or criminal prosecution authorities).

G. Retention periods for personal data
--------------------------------------

Your personal data will be deleted once you withdraw consent, or once the purpose for processing has ceased to exist. In some cases, TeamViewer SE is legally obligated to retain data for a certain period of time. Your personal data will be deleted or anonymized as soon as they are no longer required for the purposes listed under Section C. and if the deleting or anonymizing does not conflict with legal requirements for proof and storage.

H. Statutory/contractual requirement
------------------------------------

You may choose not to provide your personal data or provide incomplete personal data. However, by not providing your personal data, we may not be able to provide you with the relevant service or support, e.g. enable you to participate in our Shareholder Meeting or use all of the functionalities of our website; where we ask for consent and you choose not to provide it, or you block, disable or delete cookies, we may not be able to provide you with the information or service requested.

This Data Protection Information Sheet provides an overview of how TeamViewer Germany GmbH, Bahnhofsplatz 2, 73033 Göppingen, Germany (hereinafter “TeamViewer” or “we”) collects and processes personal data of its customers.

Art. 2(2)(c) EU General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”), TeamViewer processes personal data in the meaning of Art. 4 GDPR and acts as Processor, whereas you act as Controller (Art. 28 GDPR). In the following, in addition to our [TeamViewer DPA](https://www.teamviewer.com/eula/#dpa)  and related [annexes](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/legal/dpa-annex/) , as amended from time to time, we summarize what personal data we collect, process or use and what rights data subjects are entitled to in connection with the use of our software and services.
