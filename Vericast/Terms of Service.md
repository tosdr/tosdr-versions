Wereserve the right to remove any content contained in or posted to the Sites or Services that we determine in oursole discretion does or may allegedly infringe another person or entity’s copyright, trademark, celebrity materialor other rights.

### Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and us in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you andwe agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Use will be resolved by binding arbitration.You and we further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of thisarbitration provision. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitratorinstead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limitedreview by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement toarbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Use, and/or youraccess to, or use of, the Sites or Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, orany other legal theory, and regardless of when the claim arises. The arbitrator also has exclusive authority toresolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitrationagreement.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND VALASSIS DIGITAL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. YOU ALSOUNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION RELATING TO ANY ACTION ORCLAIM THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR ACCESS TO, OR USE OF, THE SITES OR SERVICES.

Despite the provisions of this Section 16 above, you and we both agree that nothing in these Terms of Use will bedeemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in smallclaims court within its jurisdictional limits; (b) file a complaint with the applicable federal, state, or localagency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) tofile a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our services oraddress an intellectual property infringement claim.

Any arbitration between you and Valassis Digital will be governed by the FAA, the Commercial Dispute ResolutionProcedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of theAmerican Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA.The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or bycontacting Valassis Digital at ValDigital-Privacy@valassis.com.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by certifiedmail (“Notice”). Valassis Digital’s address for Notice is: Valassis Communications, Inc., 19975 Victor Parkway,Livonia, MI 48152, Attention: Legal Department. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim ordispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). You and Valassis Digital agree to use good faithefforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Valassis Digital do not reach an agreement to do so within 30days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration proceedings,including any exchanged materials, shall be confidential and you and Valassis Digital agree to use reasonableefforts to streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the objectives of efficient disputeresolution.

If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Use, payment of any fees will be governed by the AAARules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Michigan, but if the claim is for$10,000 or less, or as otherwise required, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely onthe basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) byan in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your registered account address.Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned writtendecision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, arebased. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expensesat any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of thearbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

YOU AND VALASSIS DIGITAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUALCAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

Further, unless both you and Valassis Digital agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than oneperson’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If Valassis Digitalmakes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to its address for Notice), you mayreject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Valassis Digital’s address forNotice, in which case your account with Valassis Digital will be immediately terminated but this arbitrationprovision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive. If any provision of thisSection 16 is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to thegreatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

They contain the entire understanding and agreement of the parties relating to thesubject matter. In the event that any provision of these terms and conditions is determined to be invalid,unenforceable or otherwise illegal, such provision shall be deemed severed and the remainder of the terms andconditions shall remain in full force and effect. No term or condition shall be deemed waived, and no breach shallbe deemed excused, unless such waiver is in writing and is executed by the party against whom such waiver or excuseis claimed.
