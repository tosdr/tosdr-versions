**_Revised July 11, 2023_**

Read our Privacy Policy at [https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy)

Welcome to the iNaturalist website ("iNaturalist" or the "Platform"). The following Terms of Use govern all use of the iNaturalist website, iOS App and Android App, the iNaturalist Network Member websites, API, and all content, services and products available at or through the websites and apps (collectively, the "Platform"). The Platform is owned and operated by iNaturalist, an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in the state of California in the United States of America (EIN 92-1296468). iNaturalist country portals in collaboration with iNaturalist Network "Members," are operated by iNaturalist. The Platform is offered subject to Your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, the iNaturalist Privacy Policy at [https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by iNaturalist (collectively, the “Agreement”).

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Platform. By accessing or using any part of the Platform, each user ("You", "Your" or "User") agrees to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If You do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You should not access the Platform or use any services made available via the Platform (the “Services”). The Platform and Services are available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old, unless parental permission has been obtained.

1. **Your iNaturalist Account and Site.**If You create an account on the Platform, You are responsible for maintaining the security of Your account, and You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account. You must not post content to Your account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others. iNaturalist may, at its discretion, change or remove any content that it considers inappropriate or unlawful. Please immediately notify iNaturalist of any unauthorized uses of Your account or any other breaches of security. iNaturalist will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
    
2. **Responsibility of Contributors.** If You post material to the Platform, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Platform (any such material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from Your use of, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. If you own the Content prior to contributing the Content to the Site, and that Content is subject to Intellectual Property rights, you retain ownership of those rights. Unless you specify otherwise when you post Content, you agree to license Content you contribute to the Platform under the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial license (CC BY-NC).
    
    By making Content available, You represent and warrant that:
    
    * the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
        
    * the Content is not spam and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
        
    * You will post only Content that is relevant to iNaturalist and at a rate and volume that does not hinder other Users' ability to use iNaturalist;
        
    * the Content is not libelous or defamatory, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
        
    * Your account details do not mislead others into thinking they represent another specific person or organization (unique pseudonyms are allowed). For example, Your login name is not the name of a person other than Yourself or company other than Your own;
        
    * Your content is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, journals and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods.
        
    
    By submitting Content to iNaturalist for inclusion on the Platform, You grant iNaturalist a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting Your observations and journal via iNaturalist, and for the purpose of displaying or promoting the Content or iNaturalist itself in other venues, such as social media or software distribution platforms. We may repackage publicly available information associated with the Content in a machine-readable format for a handful of partners, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (“GBIF”) and the Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) Open Data Sponsorship Program, and others. You represent and warrant that (a) You own and control all of the rights to the Content that You post or You otherwise have the right to post such Content to the Site; (b) the Content is accurate and not misleading; and (c) use and posting of the Content You supply does not violate these Terms of Use and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity. If You delete Content, iNaturalist will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Platform, but You acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made unavailable immediately.
    
    Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, iNaturalist has the right (though not the obligation), in iNaturalist’s sole discretion, to terminate or deny access to and use of the Platform to any individual or entity for any reason.
    
3. **Responsibility of Website Visitors.** iNaturalist has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Platform, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating the Platform, iNaturalist does not represent or imply that it endorses the material posted to the Platform, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, non-infringing or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect Yourself and Your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Platform may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Platform may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. iNaturalist disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Platform, any mislabeling by Platform visitors of observations, or from any downloading by those visitors of content posted to the Platform.
    
4. **Inappropriate Use.** You agree not to use the Platform, the iNaturalist Services, or any iNaturalist Content for any illegal, unlawful, or unauthorized purpose or activity, including but not limited to threatening, abusing, soliciting, spam, harassing, stalking, impersonating, or intimidating other iNaturalist Users.
    
5. **Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.** iNaturalist respects the intellectual property rights of others, and requests that Users of the iNaturalist Platform and Service do the same.
