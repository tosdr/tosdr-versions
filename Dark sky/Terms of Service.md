How Dark Sky users can use the Apple Weather app
================================================

Dark Sky’s features have been integrated into Apple Weather. Apple Weather offers hyperlocal forecasts for your current location, including next-hour precipitation, hourly forecasts for the next 10 days, high-resolution radar, and notifications.

Support for the Dark Sky API ended on March 31, 2023, and has been replaced by Apple’s WeatherKit API. Developers can use WeatherKit in apps with iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, and watchOS 9 or higher with a platform-specific Swift API, and on any other platform with a REST API.
