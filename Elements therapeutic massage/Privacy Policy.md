Last Revised January 9, 2023

This Privacy Policy explains our information practices, defines a user’s (“you” or “your”) privacy options and describes how your information is collected and used by WellBiz Brands, Inc. and its Affiliates, Affiliated Brands and subsidiaries (collectively, “us”, “we” “our” or “WBB”). This Privacy Policy covers all of WB websites, mobile phone applications, the website(s) at [https://wellbizbrands.com](https://wellbizbrands.com/), and specifically includes any branded website(s) or mobile phone applications that have been developed for any of our Affiliates or Affiliated Brands (the “WB Sites”). The WB Sites include, but are not limited to, 1) [drybarshops.com](https://www.drybarshops.com/), 2) [elementsmassage.com](https://elementsmassage.com/), 3) [amazinglashstudio.com](https://elementsmassage.com/), 4) [fitnesstogether.com](https://fitnesstogether.com/), 5) [radiantwaxing.com](https://www.radiantwaxing.com/), and 6) [theglowpass.com](https://www.theglowpass.com/). For the purposes of this policy, the term “Affiliate” shall mean any entity, individual, firm, or corporation, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with WBB. The Amazing Lash Studio®, Drybar®, Radiant Waxing™, Fitness Together®, and Elements Massage® franchise systems and GlowPass™ brand are collectively referred to as the “Affiliated Brands”. Please note that franchisees of the Amazing Lash Studio, Drybar, Radiant Waxing, Fitness Together, and Elements Massage franchise systems (each a “Franchisee”) are each independent entities and their processing of information may be subject to their own privacy policies. For more information on how a specific Franchisee processes your information, please direct your request to the relevant Franchisee location.

By using or accessing the WB Sites and Affiliated Brands franchised locations sites, you agree to the collection and use of information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. WBB shall have the right at any time and without prior notice, at its sole discretion, to revise this Privacy Policy. Such revisions and additions shall be effective immediately upon notice, which may be given by any means, including but not limited to posting the revised or additional terms on WB Sites. You are responsible for reviewing the WB Sites periodically for any modification to this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy is part of our [Terms of Service.](https://elementsmassage.com/terms-of-use). If you do not agree to the practices in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, do not use or access the WB Sites.

This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected on the WB Sites and any information you provide to WBB, primarily Personal Information (as defined below), which deals with individuals, rather than organizations or businesses. “Personal Information” uniquely identifies an individual by combining information collected with other data.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the online store and website located at [www.thedrybar.com](https://www.thedrybar.com/) (“Drybar Products Online”), owned and operated by Drybar Products LLC, a Helen of Troy Ltd subsidiary. Please note that while we work closely with the foregoing parties and allow users to use their online accounts at Drybar Products Online, we are not the same company or affiliates, and their privacy policy located at [www.thedrybar.com/privacy](https://www.thedrybar.com/privacy) will govern the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information in connection with Drybar Products Online.

WBB is committed to providing clients with exceptional service. As providing this service involves the collection, use, and disclosure of some Personal Information about you, protecting and ensuring the privacy of your Personal Information is one of WBB’s highest priorities. One of the ways we do that is to have this Privacy Policy, which tells you why and how we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information.

Because WBB is a U.S.-based company, the services are controlled and offered from locations in the United States. The data protection rules and rights of government access to your data in your state, province, or country may be different from those in the United States. WBB will continue to process your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**SECTION 1 – PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

Advertising Choices. Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on or through the WB Sites may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.

Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the [Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).

If you choose to opt out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.

Unfortunately, we won’t be able to send you any human resource related information or other information in accordance with applicable law (examples may be; payroll, PTO, benefits, contract information), but we will process your privacy enactment request in the same manner that we would for any other California Resident. Requesting to exercise your CCPA and CPRA privacy rights won’t change the affiliation you have with WBB in any way.

Your California privacy rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law. For example, WBB may reject privacy enactment requests if there is any suspected malice, including any which may be deceptive, fraudulent, illegal or pose a security threat.
