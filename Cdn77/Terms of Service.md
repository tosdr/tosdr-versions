Service Level Agreement
=======================

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") outlines the terms and guidelines for the quality and quantity of Services provided by DataCamp Limited ("Supplier") to you, the customer ("Customer"). This SLA is part of the broader agreement between the Supplier and the Customer, including but not limited to the Supplier's Terms and Conditions ("Terms and Conditions"), any Service Order concluded between Supplier and the Customer or any other policies and documentation which collectively form the Agreement.

Terms not defined herein shall have the same definition as provided in the Terms and Conditions.

1. Service Unavailability shall be defined as a state where the Customer cannot transmit and deliver content over the CDN77 network - the condition in which the entire CDN77 network (All PoPs) does not respond to end- user requests.
    
2. The Supplier shall provide the Service availability for the CDN77 network of 99.99%.
    
3. The Service is provided 24 hours a day, excluding the time for planned maintenance reported to the Customer at least 24 hours beforehand. Any scheduled or emergency maintenance shall not be counted as Service unavailability and shall not become a subject of SLA credits application.
    
4. The Service becomes unavailable at the moment of the Suppliers fault behavior.
    
5. The monthly SLA is calculated as follows:
    
    SLA = TS - TNTS × 100 \[%\]
    
    where:
    
    TS - duration of service in current month  
    TN - duration of service unavailability in the current month.
    
6. The monthly SLA and rates for the SLA credits are listed in the table below:
    
    | SLA | SLA credits |
    | --- | --- |
    | 99.91 - 99.99% | 5%  |
    | 99.81 - 99.90% | 10% |
    | 98.51 - 99.80% | 25% |
    | 97.51 - 98.50% | 35% |
    | 96.51 - 97.50% | 75% |
    | 95.50% and less | 100% |
    
7. The sum of the SLA credits is calculated as a percentage rate of the monthly price for Service and will be provided as a discount on the next invoice provided by the Supplier.
    
8. The amount of SLA credits cannot exceed 100% of the Monthly Plan payment paid by the Customer for the given month. The Monthly Plan sum excludes fees for additional services such as CDN Storage, Raw Logs etc.
    
9. The Customer may apply for the SLA credits if the Supplier does not provide the monthly SLA in the current month. The application for the SLA credits needs to be addressed in writing to the Supplier not later than the last day of the month during which the SLA breach has taken place otherwise the claim is no longer legally enforceable.
    
10. In the case of conflict or ambiguity between any provision contained in the body of this agreement and any provision contained in T&C, the provision in the body of T&C shall take precedence.
    
11. For any support issues, please submit a ticket at [support@cdn77.com](mailto:support@cdn77.com) or contact our 24/7 support team via live chat.
    
12. This SLA is effective from the date of signing and will remain in force for the duration of the service contract.
    
13. The Supplier reserves the right to modify, update, or amend this SLA at any time, with or without prior notice to the Customer. Such modifications may be made to reflect changes in legal requirements, industry standards, technological advancements, or the Supplier's business practices. The Supplier may notify Customers of significant changes to the SLA through various means, such as email notifications, service announcements, or updates posted on the Supplier's website. However, it remains the Customer’s responsibility to regularly review the SLA to stay informed of any changes. The continued use of the Services by the Customer after any modifications to the SLA have been made will constitute the Customer’s acceptance of the new terms. If the Customer does not agree to the modified SLA, they must discontinue use of the Services immediately.
