**Services**  
Union Street Enterprises presents MakeSurveyMoney.com which provides Services to enable its users (“Users”) access to consumer market research panels on its Site and other third party sites where Users can earn money and incentive rewards. The Site is also an affiliate for some of the services reviewed or mentioned, and therefore Union Street Enterprises may receive compensation for referring Users to these sites.

**Creation of an Account**  
In order to use certain features of the Services you must create an account (an “Account”) and provide certain information about yourself, including completing a profile which may determine your eligibility for earning participating in certain offers and surveys that pay incentives. All information you provide is voluntary but the more you answer the more likely you might be to qualify for various surveys and offers.

**Participating in our Incentive Programs.**  
Users of our Services may earn incentives for participating in surveys and other offers. In addition to the terms stated in the relevant sections of the Site with respect to how those incentives may be earned or redeemed, Union Street Enterprises reserves the right to validate users' identity prior to paying out incentives.

In addition to the terms of the offers presented by third parties those third parties may reserve the right to validate users' eligibility prior to paying incentives. Any terms of those offers are presented by the third parties and Users are responsible for reviewing those terms and for the relevant privacy policies and terms of use applicable if information is provided on a third-party site. While we strive to keep information about third-party incentive offers up-to-date on our website, these companies do make changes to their offers from time to time. Any incentive paid to our users is based on the third-party's actual payout to Union Street Enterprises. Therefore, if they change their program terms before we have an opportunity to update our website, those updated terms would apply.

Some surveys may be time sensitive or may only permit a limited number of responses after which any Users’ response will no longer be eligible and therefore will be rejected.

**Incentives Pending**  
Incentives presented by third parties may require confirmation by the applicable third parties. Once eligibility is confirmed that will be shown on the your Survey Incentive Balance dashboard. However, keep in mind that any such balance is also subject to revocation by the third party survey provider should it determine, in its sole discretion, that the survey results were not complete, accurate or are ineligible for any reason based on it’s terms.

#### 8\. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

**Governing Law.**  
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Laws of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that the Arbitration provisions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

**Resolution of Any Dispute.**  
In the event a dispute arises between you and Union Street Enterprises, we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting our customer service team online by going to [https://www.MakeSurveyMoney.com/contactus.asp](https://www.makesurveymoney.com/contactus.asp) or writing us at Union Street Enterprises, Inc. PO Box 4668 #23563, New York, NY 10163-4668. If, however, there is an issue that needs to be resolved, the following provisions of this Section 8 describe how both of us will proceed:

**Limitation of Legal Remedies.**  
If there is a dispute that remains unresolved, INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND UNION STREET ENTERPRISES EACH AGREE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE JAMS ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WITHOUT CLASS RELIEF, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES PERTAINING TO UNION STREET ENTERPRISES’ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT PURSUANT TO LAW ARE NOT ARBITRABLE; INDEMNIFICATION; CONTRIBUTION; INTERPLEADER; OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ARISING OUT OF A CLAIM. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (“Claim(s)”). The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

**Jury Trial Waiver.**  
YOU AND UNION STREET ENTERPRISES EACH VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES.

**Class Action Waiver.**  
YOU AND UNION STREET ENTERPRISES EACH AGREE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. All arbitrations under these Terms must be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class, representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by any other person ("Class Action Waiver").

**Arbitration Procedures.**  
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought (a "Notice"). All Notices to Union Street Enterprises must be sent to the following address: Union Street Enterprises, Inc. PO Box 4668 #23563, New York, NY 10163-4668. All notices to you will be sent to the email or street address provided in your account, if available. Upon receipt of such Notice, the receiving party will have a 60 day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. After the expiration of such sixty-day cure period, you or Union Street Enterprises may commence an arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed to by you and Union Street Enterprises in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and Union Street Enterprises agree that this section satisfies the writing requirement of the FAA. The arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of New York and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person or by telephone. For those claims that the arbitrator decides are not frivolous, Union Street Enterprises will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration; (2) if you prefer, will conduct the arbitration by telephone, and (3) will not seek attorneys’ fees in the event Union Street Enterprises prevails. Each party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses. The JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com. To the extent that this dispute resolution section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS rules and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitrator’s award; and any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled “Class Action Waiver”.

**Exception.**  
All parties, including related third parties, shall retain the right to seek adjudication in a small claims tribunal for disputes within the scope of such tribunal’s jurisdiction. Any dispute, which cannot be adjudicated within the jurisdiction of a small claims tribunal, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, with the exception of any Claim or action for indemnification, contribution, interpleader, or injunctive relief arising out of a Claim, which Claims or actions shall not be subject to arbitration. Any appeal of a judgment from a small claims tribunal shall be resolved by binding arbitration.

**Survival.**  
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

**Severability.**  
If any provision of this Section 8 is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.
