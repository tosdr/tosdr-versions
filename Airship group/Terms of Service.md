The Sites  provide information about and access to Airship’s products and services. They allow you to interact with us and others and provide you the opportunity to contact us directly. While we want you to enjoy the experience of visiting our Sites, we also want you to understand the terms to which you agree when visiting the Sites. References to “we,” “our,” “us” or “Airship” herein refer to Airship Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, d/b/a Airship, and our subsidiaries, service providers and designees as deemed appropriate by us.

#### COMPLIANCE WITH TERMS; PRODUCT AND SERVICE PURCHASES

If you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to the Terms, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity.

You agree to use the Sites only in accordance with the Terms, whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Sites) or you are a “Member” (which means you have registered with us for the Sites). The term “User” means a “Visitor” or a “Member.” Please read and save all of the Terms. If you do not agree with the Terms, do not use our Sites or any of their features.

Airship utilizes generative artificial intelligence powered (“AI”) search functionalities and automated chatbots, (the “Chatbot”) on the Sites.

The Terms of Use will be construed, and their performance enforced, under the laws of Oregon without reference to choice of law principles. Any dispute relating to the Terms of Use or the Sites may be litigated only in a court having jurisdiction and venue in Clackamas County for state court causes of action and in the District of Oregon for federal court causes of action. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Terms. We may assign the Terms, in whole or in part, to a related entity or to a third party.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF EITHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS SECTION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE OTHER PARTY ENTERING INTO THE TERMS.

The Terms of Use are accepted upon your use of any of the Sites or any of their  features and is further affirmed upon you becoming a Member (if applicable). The Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Airship regarding the use of our Sites and their  services and features. The failure of Airship to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of the Terms of Use is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from the Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
