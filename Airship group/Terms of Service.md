Please read these Website Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”) carefully because they govern your use of our websites including [https://www.airship.com](https://www.airship.com/) , [https://support.airship.com](https://support.airship.com/), [https://docs.airship.com/,](https://docs.airship.com/) [https://apptimize.com/, https://www.gummicube.com/ ,](https://apptimize.com/) and any other websites that we may later own or operate (each, a “Site,” and collectively, the “Sites”). The Sites  provide information about and access to Airship’s products and services. They allow you to interact with us and others and provide you the opportunity to contact us directly. While we want you to enjoy the experience of visiting our Sites, we also want you to understand the terms to which you agree when visiting the Sites. References to “we,” “our,” “us” or “Airship” herein refer to Airship Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, d/b/a Airship, and our subsidiaries, service providers and designees as deemed appropriate by us.

#### COMPLIANCE WITH TERMS; PRODUCT AND SERVICE PURCHASES

If you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to the Terms, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity.

You agree to use the Sites only in accordance with the Terms, whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Sites) or you are a “Member” (which means you have registered with us for the Sites). The term “User” means a “Visitor” or a “Member.” Please read and save all of the Terms. If you do not agree with the Terms, do not use our Sites or any of their features.

Airship utilizes generative artificial intelligence powered (“AI”) search functionalities and automated chatbots, (the “Chatbot”) on the Sites.
