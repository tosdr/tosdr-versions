We want to make sure that your personal information is stored and transferred in a way which is secure. We will therefore only transfer data outside of the UK and EEA where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data, for example:  
  
• by way of an intra-group agreement between BAT entities, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or other competent body for the transfer of personal information to jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws;  
• by way of a data transfer agreement with a third party, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or other competent body for the transfer of personal information to jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws;  
• by transferring your data to an entity which has signed up to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for the transfer of personal information from entities within the UK and EEA to entities in the United States of America or any equivalent agreement in respect of other jurisdictions;  
• by transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or other competent body in respect of that country's levels of data protection via its legislation; or  
• where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract; or  
• where you have consented to the transfer.  
Where we transfer your personal information outside the UK and EEA and where the country or territory in question does not maintain adequate data protection standards, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice. You can ask to see these by contacting us using the contact details below.

-------------------------------------

We care about protecting your information. That's why we put in place appropriate measures that are designed to prevent unauthorised access to, and misuse of, your personal information.  
  
We are committed to taking all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access.

We will keep your information relating to orders you have placed with us as required by law or other regulation (for example, because of a request by a tax authority or in connection with any anticipated litigation).  
  
If you have signed up to receive email marketing from us: we will store your personal information for as long as you are subscribed to our email marketing list. If you unsubscribe or are otherwise removed from our marketing list, we will keep your email address on our suppression list to ensure that we do not send you marketing emails.  
  
If you have contacted us with a complaint or query: we will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably required to resolve your complaint or query.  
  
The exceptions to the above are where:  
  
• we have carefully considered whether we need to retain your personal information after the periods described above to potentially establish, bring or defend legal proceedings or to comply with a legal or regulatory requirement;  
• we actually bring or defend a legal claim or other proceedings during the period we retain your personal information, in which case we will retain your personal information until those proceedings have concluded and no further appeals are possible;  
• you exercise your right to require us to retain your personal information for a period longer than our stated retention period (see further Right to restrict processing below);  
• you exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see further Right to erasure below); or  
• in limited cases, a court or regulator requires us to keep your personal information for a longer or shorter period.  
  
When it is no longer necessary to retain your data, we will delete the personal information that we hold about you from our systems (either by erasing or anonymising that data). After that time, we may retain aggregated data (from which you cannot be identified) and retain it for analytical and statistical purposes.  
  

10\. YOUR RIGHTS
----------------

You have a number of rights in relation to your information under data protection law. In relation to certain rights, we may ask you for information to confirm your identity and, where applicable, to help us to search for your personal information. Except in rare cases, we will respond to you within one month from either: (i) the date that we have confirmed your identity; or (ii) where we do not need to do this because we already have this information, from the date we received your request.  
  
Right to object  
  
This right enables you to object to us processing your personal information where we do so for one of the following reasons:  
  
• where we rely on our legitimate interests to do process your information;  
• to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority;  
• where your right to withdraw consent does not apply; or  
• for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.  
  
Except for the purposes for which we are sure we can continue to process your personal information, we will temporarily stop processing your personal information in line with your objection until we have investigated the matter. If we agree that your objection is justified in accordance with your rights under data protection laws, we will permanently stop using your personal information for those purposes. Otherwise we will provide you with our justification as to why we need to continue using your personal information.  
  
Right to withdraw consent  
  
Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal information for certain activities (for example, for marketing), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to use your personal information for that purpose unless we consider that there is an alternative legal basis to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition. If you withdraw your consent, our use of your personal information before you withdraw is still lawful.  
  
To withdraw your consent to marketing communications, please use the unsubscribe tool in the relevant communication.  
  
Right of access (‘Data Subject Access Requests’)  
  
You may ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless permitted by law. If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.  
  
If you would like to request access to your information, it would assist us with dealing with your request if you could use the subject heading ‘Data Subject Access Request’, or quote this over the phone, when contacting us. Please note that this is not mandatory and we will still deal with any requests without this reference.  
  
Right to erasure  
  
You have the right to request that we erase your personal information in certain circumstances. Normally, this right exists where:  
  
• the data is no longer necessary;  
• you have withdrawn your consent to us using your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue;  
• the data has been processed unlawfully;  
• it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our obligations under law; or  
• you object to the processing of your data and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.  
  
We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so.  
  
When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data.  
  
Right to restrict processing  
  
You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances, for example if you dispute the accuracy of the personal information that we hold about you, you object to our processing of your personal information for our legitimate interests or you require us to keep it in connection with legal proceedings. If we have shared your personal information with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal information.  
  
We may only process your information whilst its processing is restricted if we have your consent or are legally permitted to do so, for example for storage purposes, to protect the rights of another individual or company or in connection with legal proceedings.  
  
Right to rectification  
  
You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal information that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal information with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You may also request details of the third parties to whom we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal information. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.  
  
Right of data portability  
  
If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal information between service providers where we rely on your consent or the performance of your contract as the lawful basis to use that information. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer the details we hold on you to another third party. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format so that you can transfer the data. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you if technically possible.  
  
Rights relating to automated decisions  
  
In certain circumstances, you may contest a decision made about you based purely on automated processing and where the processing is not required by law. You may also ask us to stop making such decisions using automated processing alone.  
  
Right to complain  
  
You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority which is the Information Commissioner's Office in the UK. You can contact them in the following ways:  
  
• Phone: 0303 123 1113  
• Email: casework@ico.org.uk  
• Post: Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF
