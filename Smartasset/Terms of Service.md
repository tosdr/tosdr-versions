**With respect to General Content:** SmartAsset.com IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE, TAX ADVICE OR FINANCIAL ADVICE (OTHER THAN REFERRALS TO INVESTMENT ADVISERS OR INVESTMENT ADVISER REPRESENTATIVES). SmartAsset IS NOT A FINANCIAL PLANNER, BROKER OR TAX ADVISOR. The Service is intended only to assist you in your understanding of financial organization and decision-making and is broad in scope. Your personal financial situation is unique, and any information and investing strategies obtained through SmartAsset.com may not be appropriate for your situation. Accordingly, before making any final decisions or implementing any financial strategy, you should consider obtaining additional information and advice from your accountant or other financial advisers who is fully aware of your individual circumstances. We'll say this: We don't expect you pay us a share of your gains when we put you onto a good investment. SIMILARLY, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACTION YOU TAKE OR FAIL TO TAKE BASED UPON INFORMATION YOU RECEIVED THROUGH THE SITE, APPS OR SERVICES AND SPECIFICALLY WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES YOU SUFFER AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR INACTION. The Site, Apps and Services are provided as a convenience and is not intended to be used to replace any other decisioning method or tool that you use and should not be used to provided financial services to third parties, such as clients or customers.

**With respect to the “Find an Advisor” service**: SmartAsset’s services are limited to referring users to third party registered investment advisers and/or investment adviser representatives (“RIA/IARs”) that have elected to participate in our matching platform based on information gathered from users through our online questionnaire.  SmartAsset does not review the ongoing performance of any RIA/IAR, participate in the management of any user’s account by an RIA/IAR or provide advice regarding specific investments. RIA/IARs are matched to users based on (1) geographic location; (2) amount of investable assets; and (3) whether the RIA/IAR and the user are both willing to work remotely. Our proprietary algorithm also considers RIA/IARs’ remaining available budget, and RIA/IARs that have purchased more leads are therefore more likely to appear in a User’s matches.Additional factors may be included in our proprietary matching process in the future.  Important information regarding our services and associated conflicts of interest is available in our Form ADV Part 2A brochure, available at [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/307375](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/307375).  Users should review our brochure before using our Find an Advisor service. Use of the Find an Advisor service constitutes consent to these limitations on the scope of our services. 

13\. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE SITE AND APPS AND TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES IF YOU AGREE TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF OUR LIABILITY TO YOU AND TO THIRD PARTIES.

Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY – FIND AN ADVISOR:**  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not disclaim any liability relating to the provision of services which cannot be disclaimed pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.  Accordingly, the limitations of this Section 13 do not apply to our referrals of users to advisers registered or chartered as fiduciaries ("Adviser(s)") with a regulatory body in the United States pursuant to our Find an Advisor service.

**18\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.** This section 18 shall be referred to herein as the “Arbitration Agreement.” Except for a claim by SmartAsset of infringement or misappropriation of SmartAsset’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, any and all disputes between you and SmartAsset arising under or related in any way to these Terms or your use of the Site, Apps or Services, or your receipt of any email, telephonic, text message or other communication from us or are representatives must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly. YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND SMARTASSET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND SMARTASSET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.

**(a)** Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this Arbitration Agreement, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and us and our employees, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to these the Services or these Terms, shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration.  
**(b)** Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from JAMS. As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by JAMS’s rules for commercial arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures for consumer-related disputes. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate, the parties will agree on an alternative arbitration forum.  
**(c)** You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.  
**(d)** You and we must abide by the following rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTYS’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (6) the arbitrator’s award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.  
**(e)** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or we may bring an individual action in small claims court provided such action remains in such court. Further, claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding our agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in New York, New York in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and the parties hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.  
**(f)** With the exception of the second paragraph of this Arbitration Agreement and subparts (1) and (2) of subsection 18.(d) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class, representative or collective basis), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the second paragraph of this Arbitration Agreement and/or subparts (1) or (2) of subsection 18(d) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class, representative or collective basis) is found to be invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim for relief, then that claim for relief and only that claim for relief shall be severed from the arbitration and brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.  
**(g)** Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if we seek to terminate this Arbitration Agreement, any such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of the Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site or App, and shall not be effective as to any claim of which you provided us with written notice prior to the date of termination. For more information on JAMS, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call JAMS at 800-352-5267 or visit the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com.  
**(h)** **Thirty-Day Right to Opt-Out.** You have the right to opt-out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Financial Insight Technology, Inc., 122 East 42nd Street, Suite 4300, New York, NY 10168 or ATTN: email info@smartasset.com within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your full name, postal address, and e-mail address (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

**19\. GENERAL TERMS.** You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. The Terms of Service and the relationship between you and SmartAsset will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to any choice of laws or principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service, or your use of the Site, Apps, or Services not subject to arbitration under Section 18 must be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in New York, New York and in no other jurisdiction. You further consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any such court. You may not transfer, assign or delegate any of your rights and/or duties under the Agreement to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void. We have the rights to freely assign our rights under this Agreement. You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in the Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make the Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. The Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements. Subject to subsection 18(f) above, if for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the Terms of Service will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

**20\. SURVIVAL.** Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 11 through 21, as well as any other limitations on liability explicitly set forth herein and our proprietary rights in and to the Site, Apps, Content, Our Technology and the Services, will survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.

SmartAsset Advisors, LLC ("SmartAsset"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Insight Technology, is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. SmartAsset’s services are limited to referring users to third party advisers registered or chartered as fiduciaries ("Adviser(s)") with a regulatory body in the United States that have elected to participate in our matching platform based on information gathered from users through our online questionnaire. SmartAsset receives compensation from Advisers for our services. SmartAsset does not review the ongoing performance of any Adviser, participate in the management of any user’s account by an Adviser or provide advice regarding specific investments. We do not manage client funds or hold custody of assets, we help users connect with relevant financial advisors. This is not an offer to buy or sell any security or interest. All investing involves risk, including loss of principal. Working with an adviser may come with potential downsides such as payment of fees (which will reduce returns). There are no guarantees that working with an adviser will yield positive returns. The existence of a fiduciary duty does not prevent the rise of potential conflicts of interest.
