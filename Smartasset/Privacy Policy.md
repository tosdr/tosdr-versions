**1\. USER CONSENT.** By submitting personal data through our Site and Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  
  
**2\. A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN.** We do not intentionally gather personal data about visitors who are under the age of 13.  
  
**3\. A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.** Your personal data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. **BY USING OUR SITE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL DATA THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**  
  
**4\. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT.**

Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this personal data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network.  
We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.

**14\. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**  
We are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“**CCPA**”) to provide to California residents an explanation of how we collect, use and share their personal Information, and of the rights and choices we offer California residents regarding our handling of their personal information. CCPA Scope and Exclusions. The description of our [Privacy Practices](#privacy_practices) and [Privacy Rights](#privacy_rights) in this Notice apply only to California residents whose interactions with SmartAsset are limited to:

* Visiting our website,
* Signing up for email alerts,
* Commenting on or contributing to our forums, or
* Applying for our job openings on our websites (however, the CCPA does not extend [Privacy Rights](#privacy_rights) to job applicants).

  
  
The description of our [Privacy Practices](#privacy_practices) and CCPA Privacy Rights do not apply to the personal information we collect, use or disclose about:  

* Consumers who initiate or complete the process of applying for financial products or services. This is because this information is subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), and implementing regulations, or the California Financial Information Privacy Act (“FIPA”), and
* Representatives of businesses that seek to obtain our Services, or to provide their products or services to us.

  
**Privacy Practices.** We do not sell personal information. As we explain in our [Privacy Policy](#privacy_policy):

* We use cookies and other tracking technologies to analyze website traffic and facilitate advertising. If you would like to learn how you may opt out of our (and our third party advertising partners’) use of cookies and other tracking technologies, please review the instructions provided in the [Online Tracking Opt-out Guide](#opt_out).
* Through our services – for example, by inquiring about retaining a financial advisor – you direct us to disclose your information to companies that provide the services in which you are interested.

  
Here is a description of our relevant privacy practices:

Please note that we may also disclose personal information to comply with law, and for compliance, fraud prevention, and safety purposes; in the event of business transfers; and to our professional advisors, as further described above in the Privacy Policy.  
  
**The CCPA grants individuals the following rights:**

* Information. You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared your Personal Information during the past 12 months.
* Access. You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.
* Deletion. You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.

  
Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. We will also respond to requests for information and access only to the extent we are able to associate with a reasonable effort the information we maintain with the identifying details you provide in your request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.  
You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.  
  
**How to Submit a Request.** To request access to or deletion of personal information:

* email: info@smartasset.com

**Identity verification.** The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information before providing a substantive response to the request.  
**Authorized agents.** California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.

SmartAsset Advisors, LLC ("SmartAsset"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Insight Technology, is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. SmartAsset’s services are limited to referring users to third party advisers registered or chartered as fiduciaries ("Adviser(s)") with a regulatory body in the United States that have elected to participate in our matching platform based on information gathered from users through our online questionnaire. SmartAsset receives compensation from Advisers for our services. SmartAsset does not review the ongoing performance of any Adviser, participate in the management of any user’s account by an Adviser or provide advice regarding specific investments. We do not manage client funds or hold custody of assets, we help users connect with relevant financial advisors. This is not an offer to buy or sell any security or interest. All investing involves risk, including loss of principal. Working with an adviser may come with potential downsides such as payment of fees (which will reduce returns). There are no guarantees that working with an adviser will yield positive returns. The existence of a fiduciary duty does not prevent the rise of potential conflicts of interest.
