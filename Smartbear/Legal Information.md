10\. Information for Individuals in the EU and UK
-------------------------------------------------

In accordance with European and UK law (collectively, the “GDPR”), individuals in the EU and/or UK may have additional rights relating to the collection and processing of personal information. 

### a. Basis for Processing

Our legal basis for processing the personal information described in this Notice will depend on the personal information concerned and the context in which we process it. We process personal information from you:

* where we need it to perform a contract with you;
* where the processing is in our legitimate interests (including the purposes described, above, in _How We Use personal information_);
* where the processing is necessary for us to meet our applicable legal obligations; or
* if we otherwise have your consent.

### b. Your Privacy Rights

Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to:

* **Request access** to your personal information.
* **Request correction** of your personal information.
* **Request erasure** of your personal information. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
* **Object to processing** of your personal information.
* **Request restriction of processing** of your personal information..
* **Request the transfer** of your personal information to you or to a third party.
* **Withdraw consent** at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights or would like further information please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://smartbear.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Depending on the nature of your request, we may need to verify your identity.

Depending on where you are located, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or other regulatory agency if you believe that we have violated any of the rights concerning personal information. We encourage you to first reach out to us at [\[email protected\]](https://smartbear.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or using the address in the “Contact Us” section below, so we have an opportunity to address your concerns directly before you do so.

11\. Storage, Security and Retention of Information
---------------------------------------------------

We take reasonable steps to protect the personal information users share with us, including, but not limited to, setup of processes, equipment and software to avoid unauthorized access or disclosure of this information. No transmission of information via the Internet can be entirely secure, however, so please always use caution when submitting personal information. We will retain your personal information in compliance with the uses described in this Notice, as well as to comply with our legal, financial reporting, or compliance obligations.

12\. Transfers of Personal Information
--------------------------------------

We process and store personal information both inside the United States and overseas. If you live outside of the United States, be advised that we may transfer your personal information to the United States and other countries, whose laws may not provide the same protections as the laws in your country. Personal information transferred outside of the European Economic Area will be subject to the appropriate safeguards pursuant to GDPR and other applicable law, including without limitation, standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
