Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable Order grants a perpetual license to On-Premise Software, the license will become perpetual upon full payment of the license fees for such On-Premise Software listed in the Order.

7.3 **Termination**.

7.3.1 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated:

7.3.1.1 by either party for cause by written notice, without opportunity to cure, in the event that: (a) the other party fails to function as a going concern; (b) a receiver, trustee, or other custodian for the other party or its assets is appointed, applied for, or consented to; (c) the other party becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature in the ordinary course; (d) the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (e) the other party is liquidated or dissolved; or (f) any proceedings are commenced by or against the other party under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtorâs relief law and not dismissed within 60 days.

7.3.1.2 by either party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice thereof; or

7.3.1.3 by SmartBear immediately by delivery of written notice to Customer if Customer violates Section 4 (_Software Restrictions_).

7.3.2 If this Agreement is terminated as set forth above, at SmartBearâs option any outstanding Order shall continue until the expiration of its current term, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to apply to such Order.

7.3.3 Termination does not restrict either party from pursuing any remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, or relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all fees that have already accrued or become payable hereunder.

7.3.4 Any right, obligation, or required performance of the parties in this Agreement which, by its express terms or nature is intended to survive termination of this Agreement, will survive any such termination.

**8\. FEES AND PAYMENT**

8.1 **Fees**. Customer shall pay SmartBear the Fees on the dates specified in the applicable Order. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and non-refundable, and Customer will not, except as expressly provided herein, be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid for the SaaS, On-Premise Software, Maintenance and Support Services, or any other amounts for any reason.

8.1.1 Except as otherwise stated herein or in an Order, SmartBear may increase its Fees, including subscription and maintenance fees, no more frequently than once per calendar year and by an amount not to exceed SmartBearâs prevailing prices to its customers generally for the applicable software or services. The foregoing notwithstanding, if the Initial Term or Initial Maintenance Term, as applicable, is two years or longer, yearly Fee increases will not begin until the start of the first Renewal Term. SmartBear shall give Customer written notice of any increase at least 30 days before the increase goes into effect.

8.1.2 The licensing parameters, number of units, Fees, and time period purchased in the applicable Order cannot be decreased during the term of the Order. For subscriptions to the SaaS, all monthly subscription fees shall be paid in advance of the subscription period to which such payment relates. If a payment date is not otherwise specified in the applicable Order, Customer shall pay all Fees within thirty (30) days from the invoice date, without offset or deduction. Customer shall make all payments in the applicable currency on or before the due date.

8.1.3 If Customer fails to make any payment when due, without limiting SmartBear's other rights and remedies:

8.1.3.1 SmartBear may charge interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law;

8.1.3.2 Customer shall reimburse SmartBear for all reasonable costs incurred by SmartBear in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys' fees, court costs, and collection agency fees; and

8.1.3.3 SmartBear may suspend access to the SaaS or On-Premise Software in accordance with Section 8.3 below (_Suspension_).

8.1.4 All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement are payable without deduction and are net of any tax, tariff, duty, or assessment imposed by any government authority (national, state, provincial, or local), including any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, property, withholding, or value added tax withheld at the source. If applicable law requires withholding or deduction of such taxes or duties, Customer shall separately pay SmartBear the withheld or deducted amount. For clarity, Customer is not responsible for any taxes imposed on SmartBear's income.

8.2 **Support Fees**. If Customer purchased a subscription to the SaaS, Maintenance and Support Services are provided without additional charge as part of Customerâs subscription to the SaaS. If Customer purchased a license to use the On-Premise Software, Maintenance and Support Services are provided in consideration of payment of applicable annual maintenance and support fees. Maintenance and Support Services for On-Premise Software commence upon delivery of the On-Premise Software. Thereafter, the Initial Maintenance Term automatically renews, at the then-current and then-applicable annual maintenance fee, for subsequent one-year periods unless one party gives the other written notice of non-renewal at least one hundred and twenty (120) days before the end of the Initial Maintenance Term or the then-current Renewal Maintenance Term.

8.3 **Suspension**.

8.3.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, SmartBear may temporarily suspend Customer's and any other Authorized User's access to any portion or all of the SaaS or On-Premise Software if:

8.3.1.1 there is a threat or attack on the SaaS or On-Premise Software that SmartBear reasonably believes may compromise the data of SmartBearâs customers;

8.3.1.2 Customer or any other Authorized User is using the SaaS or On-Premise Software in violation of the AUP; or

8.3.1.3 there is a material breach of this Agreement or the applicable Order by Customer, including failure to pay for the SaaS or On-Premise Software.

8.3.2 SmartBear shall use commercially reasonable efforts: (a) to provide written notice of any suspension to Customer; and (b) to resume providing access to the SaaS or On-Premise Software as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise to the suspension is cured. SmartBear will have no liability for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of or profits), or other consequences that Customer or any other Authorized User may incur as a result of a suspension.

**9\. CONFIDENTIALITY**

9.1 **Confidential Information**. From time to time, each party may disclose Confidential Information to the other party. The receiving party shall not disclose the disclosing party's Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the receiving party's employees, agents, or subcontractors who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder and who are required to protect the Confidential Information in a manner no less stringent than required under this Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the disclosing partyâs Confidential Information using the same care as the receiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information of similar importance, but in no event will the receiving party use less than reasonable care. The receiving party shall only use the disclosing partyâs Confidential Information to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement The parties agree that their mutual covenant not to disclose or use Confidential Information of the disclosing party shall not apply to any information to the extent that the information:

9.1.1 is, or at any time becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the receiving party;

9.1.2 is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to or use of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party;

9.1.3 is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without any restrictions or obligations of confidentiality;

9.1.4 is already known by the receiving party without any obligation of confidentiality prior to obtaining the Confidential Information from the disclosing party;

9.1.5 is approved for release in writing by the disclosing party;

9.1.6 is required to be disclosed in response to a valid court order, authorized government agency, or to establish a party's rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings; provided, that notice is given promptly to the party whose Confidential Information is to be so disclosed and the parties shall cooperate in seeking a protective order and engaging in other such efforts.

9.2 **Protection Period**. Each party's obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the date such Confidential Information is first disclosed to the receiving party and will expire two (2) years after termination of this Agreement: however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.

**10\. LIMITED WARRANTY**

10.1 **Limited Warranty**. SmartBear warrants that for the Warranty Period the SaaS or the On-Premise Software, as applicable, will perform materially in accordance with its Documentation. If, during the Warranty Period, the SaaS or the On-Premise Software fails to comply with the limited warranty set forth in this Section 10.1, and such failure is not excluded from this warranty pursuant to Section 10.2, SmartBear shall, at its sole option, repair or replace the SaaS or the On-Premise Software; provided that Customer promptly notifies SmartBear in writing of such failure and provides SmartBear with all information and cooperation SmartBear reasonably requests to resolve the reported failure, including sufficient information to enable SmartBear to recreate such failure. If SmartBear determines that neither repair nor replacement is commercially reasonable, SmartBear may terminate the Order for such On-Premise Software, in its entirety or only with respect to the affected component or part, effective on written notice to Customer, in which case SmartBear shall provide a pro-rata refund of any pre-paid fees. The remedies set forth in this Section 10.1 are Customerâs sole remedies and SmartBearâs sole liability for breach of the warranty in this Section 10.1.

10.2 **Warranty Disclaimer**. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.1, THE SAAS AND ON-PREMISE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND SMARTBEAR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. SMARTBEAR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. SMARTBEAR MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE SAAS, THE ON-PREMISE SOFTWARE, OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR RESULTS OF THE USE THEREOF WILL MEET CUSTOMERâS OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S OR ENTITY'S REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY OF CUSTOMERâS OR ANY THIRD PARTY'S SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, OR OTHER SERVICES, OR BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED.

**11\. INDEMNIFICATION**

11.1 **SmartBear Indemnification**. SmartBear shall indemnify and defend Customer and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns from and against any Third-Party Claim that the SaaS, On-Premise Software, or any use of the SaaS or On-Premise Software in accordance with this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates such third party's registered patents, its copyrights, or its trade secrets.

11.2 **Remediation**.

11.2.1 If such a Third-Party Claim is made or SmartBear anticipates such a Third-Party Claim will be made, Customer agrees to permit SmartBear, at SmartBear's sole discretion, to

11.2.4 This Section 11 shall not apply to the extent that any such Third-Party Claim arises out of:

11.2.4.1 Customerâs breach of this Agreement;

11.2.4.2 revisions to the Software made without SmartBearâs written consent;

11.2.4.3 Customerâs failure to incorporate On-Premise Software updates or upgrades that would have avoided the alleged infringement, provided SmartBear offered such updates or upgrades without charges not otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement;

11.2.4.4 SmartBearâs modification of the Software in compliance with specifications provided by Customer;

11.2.4.5 use of the Software in combination with hardware or software not provided by SmartBear, unless the Documentation or Specifications refers to a combination with such hardware or software (without directing the user not to perform such a combination); or

11.4.2 Indemnitor will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Indemnified Party will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations.

**12\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

12.1 IN NO EVENT WILL SMARTBEAR BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.

All goodwill associated with Customerâs trademarks inures solely to Customer, and SmartBear shall take no action to damage the goodwill associated with the trademarks or with Customer.

13.7 **Pre-Printed Terms**. The terms of any purchase order or other document relating to the transactions issued by Customer shall not apply nor supersede the terms of this Agreement or any applicable Order.

13.8 **Notices**. Any notices to SmartBear must be sent to SmartBearâs applicable corporate headquarters address set forth in the preamble to this Agreement and must be delivered either in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or by recognized overnight courier service, and are deemed given upon receipt by SmartBear. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer hereby consents to receiving electronic communications from SmartBear. These electronic communications may include notices about applicable fees and charges, transactional information, and other information concerning or related to the SaaS or the On-Premise Software. Customer agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that SmartBear sends to Customer electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.

13.9 **No Waiver**. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any failure by SmartBear to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Customer or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit SmartBearâs rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.

13.10 **Dispute Resolution**. In the event of a dispute, prior to initiating any action, Customer shall submit a description of the dispute to the appropriate SmartBear representative (â**Dispute Notice**â). If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) business days after the Dispute Notice, either party may call for escalation by written notice to the other (â**Escalation Notice**â). In that case each party shall select an executive with the authority to make commitments that would resolve the dispute, and the two executives shall meet within ten (10) business days after the Escalation Notice and shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. Except to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable harm or to preserve rights or remedies, neither party shall initiate arbitration or litigation until ten (10) business days after the executives have met to negotiate.

13.11 **Assignment**. This Agreement is personal to Customer and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without SmartBearâs prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing will be void and without effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement, without prior written consent, in its entirety in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of either partyâs assets. SmartBear expressly reserves the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.

13.12 **Compliance.** In keeping with SmartBearâs compliance program, SmartBear complies with policies covering ethics and business conduct, interest, anti-bribery and corruption, environmental protection, and whistleblower protection. SmartBearâs employees are also required to comply with these policies.

13.13 **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement, together with the DPA, AUP, and Order constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.

13.14 **Amendment**. SmartBear may amend this Agreement from time to time by posting an amended version at its Terms of Use page on SmartBearâs website with the date of the amendment and notifying Customer of the amended version through communications from Customerâs SmartBear account manager. Such amendment will be deemed accepted and become effective 30 days after such notice (the â**Proposed Amendment Date**â) unless Customer first gives SmartBear written notice of rejection of the amendment. In the event of such rejection, this Agreement will continue under its original provisions, and the amendment will become effective at the start of Customerâs next Renewal Term following the Proposed Amendment Date (unless Customer first terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 (_Term and Termination_). Customerâs continued use of the SaaS of On-Premise Software following the effective date of an amendment will confirm Customerâs consent thereto. This Agreement may not be amended in any other way except through a written agreement by authorized representatives of each party, including through an Order as described in Section 13.15 below (_Order of Precedence_). SmartBear may revise the DPA or the AUP at any time by posting a new version on its Website, and such new version will become effective on the date it is posted, provided if such amendment materially reduces Customerâs rights or protections, the notice and consent procedures above will apply to the DPA or AUP amendment.

13.15 **Order of Precedence**. If the terms of any attachment to the Agreement or any Order or other purchase document conflicts with the Agreement, the Agreement will control, with the following exceptions:

13.15.1 The DPA will control over the Agreement as to any provision relating to data subject to the DPA.
