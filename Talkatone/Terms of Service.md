1\. Terms of Use
================

1.1 (Version No. 10. Effective Date: April 6, 2023) Please read these terms of use (“Agreement” or “Terms of Use”) carefully before using the services offered by [Talkatone](https://www.talkatone.com/) LLC (“Company” or “we”). This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the various websites owned and operated by Company, including, without limitation, the [https://www.talkatone.com](https://www.talkatone.com/) website and domain name (“Sites”), and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively “Service”). By using the Sites or Service in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Sites, you agree to be legally bound by this Agreement. This Agreement applies to all users of the Sites or Service, including users who are also contributors of content, information, and other materials or services on the Sites. 1.2 You understand and agree that the Service is intended for use only in the United States and Canada, and only United States or Canadian phone numbers are available under the Service. The Company is not responsible for users who voluntarily choose to use the Service outside the intended territories above. In addition, you understand and agree that any or all parts of the Service may not be available in certain parts of the United States and Canada.

### 2\. Acceptance of Terms

2.1 The Service is offered subject to acceptance, without modification, of these Terms of Use and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Sites by Company. In addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Company from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference. 2.2 The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 16 years old. You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are at least 16 years old, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. If you’re agreeing to these Terms of Use on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms of Use on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms of Use (in which case the reference to “you” and “your” in these Terms of Use, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). Company may, in its absolute sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.

### 3\. Modification of Terms of Use

3.1 Company reserves the right, at its absolute sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Terms of Use, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including, without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time and in any manner by posting such changes on our website. You should review this Agreement regularly for changes and can easily identify if changes have been made by checking the “Effective Date” at the top of this page.

Company may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms of Use, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of all of the changes.

### 4\. Privacy

4.1 Company’s current Sites and Service [privacy statement](https://www.talkatone.com/privacy/) is located at [https://www.talkatone.com/privacy/](https://www.talkatone.com/privacy/) (the “Privacy Policy”) and is incorporated into these Terms of Use.

In the United States, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as reasonably possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [support@talkatone.com](https://www.talkatone.com/#support). To the extent the Company processes any personal data on behalf of the customer in connection with the provision of the Service and (a) the personal data relates to individuals located in the EEA; or (b) the customer is located in the EEA, the parties agree that such personal data will be processed in accordance with the Data Processing Addendum set out in Schedule A (“DPA”). In the event of any conflict between the remainder of the Agreement and the DPA, the DPA will prevail. For the purposes of this section 4, the terms “personal data”, “process” and “EEA” have the meanings given in the Data Processing Addendum.

The parties acknowledge and agree that the Agreement (subject to any changes to the Service agreed between the parties) and this DPA shall be customer’s complete and final instructions to Talkatone in relation to the processing of Customer Personal Data. 2.3 Processing outside the scope of this DPA or the Agreement will require prior written agreement between customer and Talkatone on additional instructions for Processing. 2.4 **Required consents.** Where required by applicable Data Protection Laws, customer will ensure that it has obtained/will obtain all necessary consents and complies with all applicable requirements under Data Protection Laws for the Processing of Customer Personal Data by Talkatone in accordance with the Agreement.
