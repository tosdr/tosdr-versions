### BIPA Privacy Policy

**Terra Staffing Group LLC – Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act Policy**

Terra Staffing Group LLC (referred to as the “Company”) has established the following biometric information privacy policy:

**Biometric Data Defined**  
As used in this policy, biometric data includes “biometric identifiers” and “biometric information” as defined in the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS § 14/1, et seq. “Biometric identifier” means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry. Biometric identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, human biological samples used for valid scientific testing or screening, demographic data, tattoo descriptions, or physical descriptions such as height, weight, hair color, or eye color. Biometric identifiers do not include information captured from a patient in a health care setting or information collected, used, or stored for health care treatment, payment, or operations under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. “Biometric information” means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual. Biometric information does not include information derived from items or procedures excluded under the definition of biometric identifiers.

**Purpose for Collection of Biometric Data**  
The Company and the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software collect, store, and use biometric data solely for employee identification, attendance records and fraud prevention.

**Disclosure and Authorization**  
To the extent that the Company and the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software collect, capture, or otherwise obtain biometric data relating to an employee, the Company must first:

a. Inform the employee in writing that the Company and the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software are collecting, capturing, or otherwise obtaining the employee’s biometric data, and that the Company is providing such biometric data to the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software;

b. Inform the employee in writing of the specific purpose and length of time for which the employee’s biometric data is being collected, stored, and used; and

c. Receive a written release signed by the employee (or his, her, or their legally authorized representative) authorizing the Company and the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software to collect, store, and use the employee’s biometric data for the specific purposes disclosed by the Company, and for the Company to provide such biometric data to the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software.

The Company and the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software will not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from employees’ biometric data; provided, however, the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software may be paid for products or services used by the Company that utilize such biometric data.

**Disclosure**  
The Company will not disclose or disseminate any biometric data to anyone other than its licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software providing products and services using biometric data  
without/unless:  
a. First obtaining written employee consent to such disclosure or dissemination;  
b. The disclosed data completes a financial transaction requested or authorized by the employee;  
c. Disclosure is required by state or federal law or municipal ordinance; or  
d. Disclosure is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**Retention Schedule**  
The Company shall retain employee biometric data only until, and shall request that the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software permanently destroy such data when the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining such biometric data has been satisfied, such as the termination of the employee’s employment with the Company, or the employee moves to a role within the Company for which the biometric data is not used. The biometric information will be permanently destroyed no later than six (6) months following the date of separation from any assignment utilizing biometric information.

**Data Storage**  
The Company shall use a reasonable standard of care to store, transmit and protect from disclosure any paper or electronic biometric data collected. Such storage, transmission, and protection from disclosure shall be performed in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which the Company stores, transmits and protects from disclosure other confidential and sensitive information, including personal information that can be used to uniquely identify an individual or an individual’s account or property, such as genetic markers, genetic testing information, account numbers, PINs, driver’s license numbers and social security numbers.

The licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software utilizes Biometric time clock technology that does not store the actual biometric data, rather a mathematical representation of such. These Biometric time clocks have unique resolution, capture size, and algorithms which make all biometric data virtually incompatible with other biometric devices.

**Company Name: Terra Staffing Group LLC (the “Company”)**

The employee named below has been advised and understands that the Company and the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software collect, retain, and use biometric data for the purpose of identifying employees and recording time entries when utilizing the Company’s biometric time clocks or time clock attachments. Biometric time clocks are computer-based systems that scan an employee’s finger for purposes of identification. The computer system extracts unique data points and creates a unique mathematical representation used to verify the employee’s identity, for example, when the employee arrives at or departs from the workplace.

The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”), regulates the collection, storage, use, and retention of “biometric identifiers” and “biometric information.” “Biometric identifier” means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry. “Biometric information” means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.

The undersigned employee acknowledges that he/she has received the attached Biometric Information Privacy Policy, and that he/she consents to the Company and the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software’s collection, storage, and use of biometric data through a biometric time clock, including to the extent that it utilizes the employee’s biometric identifiers or biometric information as defined in BIPA, and consents to the Company providing such biometric data to the licensor of the Company’s time and attendance software.
