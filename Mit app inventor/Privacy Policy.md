================================================

_These Terms were modified on July 1, 2020. The previous version can be found [here](https://appinventor.mit.edu/about/termsofservice-201504)._

MIT App Inventor Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
================================================

_MIT Center for Mobile Learning_

Welcome to MIT’s Center for Mobile Learning’s App Inventor website (the “Site”). The Site runs on Google’s App Engine service. You must read and agree to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Terms”) prior to using any portion of this Site. These Terms are an agreement between you and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by these Terms, please immediately exit this Site.

MIT reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time and will publish notice of any such modifications online on this page for a reasonable period of time following such modifications, and by changing the effective date of these Terms. By continuing to access the Site after notice of such changes have been posted, you signify your agreement to be bound by them. Be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of these Terms.

Description of MIT App Inventor
-------------------------------

From this Site you can access MIT App Inventor, which lets you develop applications for Android devices using a web browser and either a connected phone or emulator. You can also use the Site to store your work and keep track of your projects. App Inventor was originally developed by Google. The Site also includes documentation and educational content, and this is being licensed to you under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

Account Required for Use of MIT App Inventor
--------------------------------------------

In order to log in to MIT App Inventor, you need to use a Google account. Your use of that account is subject to Google’s Terms of Service for accounts, and the information you provide to Google is governed by Google’s [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/preview/). MIT has no access to your Google account or the information you provide for it other than the account email address, which we may use to contact you. In the future, the Center for Mobile Learning may provide alternative means for using MIT App Inventor without Google accounts, at which point we will update these terms of use to reflect those alternatives.

Information about You
---------------------

Beyond the name of your Google account, you do not have to tell us anything about yourself to download the App Inventor setup software or use the MIT App Inventor Web site. From time to time, we will give you the option of telling us some things about yourself, but you do not have provide this information if you don’t want to. Please understand that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with these Terms, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these Terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us.

We track information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls were used. We also track information about user projects and how those projects are developed when connected to Android devices.

We may log the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Site, and we may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Various web analysis tools are used to collect this information. Some of the information is collected through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer). You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar.

Among other things, we may use the information that you provide (including your Personally Identifiable Information) in connection with the following

* In order to debug and improve the MIT App Inventor system.
* For purposes of scientific research, particularly, for example, in the areas of how people learn and create with MIT App Inventor.
* For the purpose for which you specifically provided the personal information, for example to respond to a specific inquiry or provide you the specific course and/or services you select.
* To publish information gathered about learning and creating with MIT App Inventor but only as non-personally identifiable data.
* As otherwise described to you at the point of collection.

Sharing with Third Parties
--------------------------

We may share the information we collect with third parties as follows:

* With service providers or contractors that perform certain functions on our behalf, including processing information that you provide to us on the Site or operating the Site or portions of it. These service providers and contractors will be obligated to keep your information confidential.
* With research collaborators, but only under the condition that they are obligated to keep any personally identifying information confidential.
* To respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or to enforce our user agreement or privacy policy, or to protect our rights or the rights of others.

The Apps You Create
-------------------

By creating and storing apps on the MIT App Inventor server you represent and warrant that you are the owner and creator of the apps, (i) that you have the authority to authorize MIT to store the apps on the MIT App Inventor Server and (ii) you will use the apps in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You, and not MIT, are solely responsible for your apps and your use of them.

MIT has no proprietary rights in the apps you create with MIT App Inventor. These apps belong to you. Your apps are stored on the MIT App Inventor server. You have the right to download your apps and delete them from the server at any time. If you delete an app, there is the possibility that MIT may be able to continue to access it from the backups we keep for purposes of system maintenance, but these backups are periodically purged and are not designed for long-term preservation. MIT will strive to keep your apps and your account accessible to you for as long as you wish, but we have no obligation to do so, and MIT has no liability for the consequences of the service becoming unavailable or your apps becoming unavailable. We therefore strongly suggest that you maintain backup copies of valuable apps at places besides the MIT App Inventor server.

User Postings
-------------

MIT App Inventor has a gallery for sharing apps, user profile information and commentary. You agree that you are responsible for your own use of the Site and your User Postings. “User Postings” include all projects, applications and content submitted, posted, published or distributed on the Site by you or other users of the Site.

By submitting or distributing your User Postings, you affirm, represent, and warrant that you are the creator and owner of or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to reproduce and publish the User Postings, and to authorize MIT and the Site’s users to reproduce, modify, publish, and otherwise distribute your User Postings as necessary to exercise the license granted by you below. You, and not MIT, are solely responsible for your User Postings and the consequences of posting or publishing them.

All content and projects on this Site are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution- ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Therefore, by submitting any User Posting you hereby license it under the CC SA license, which permits anyone to view, modify, and redistribute these materials.

MIT has no proprietary rights in your User Postings. You have the right to download or delete them from the server at any time.

Special Information for Schools
-------------------------------

MIT App Inventor values its relationship with the educational community and is honored that many educators have found MIT App Inventor to be a valuable tool for classroom learning. MIT also values the privacy of its users as explained in the MIT App Inventor Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. As many states have now passed laws regarding the use of online platforms in the classroom, MIT App Inventor has been asked to execute certain “addenda” to service contracts in order to continue the use of MIT App Inventor for classroom use. MIT App Inventor is unable to execute agreements of these sort as it does not maintain contractual agreements with school districts as part of this service. Instead, MIT App Inventor is a free, online tool available to anyone who registers for an account. If you are seeking to use MIT App Inventor for classroom use, we have developed a different version of the platform which does not collect or maintain any personally identifiable information (PII). This version is available at [http://code.appinventor.mit.edu](http://code.appinventor.mit.edu/) and may be more appropriate for your use. If you have any additional questions, please contact us at appinventor@mit.edu.

Effective Date: July 1, 2020
