### MeetMatch - Privacy Policy

This document provides the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) that governs how we, MeetMatch (“MeetMatch”, “we”, “our” or “us”), use Personal Information (as defined below) which we collect, receive and store about individuals and/or companies in connection with the use of: (i) the website https://www.meetmatch.biz/, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, a “Site”); and (ii) the MeetMatch web and mobile software application, and any other software application, that we license (each individually, and collectively, the “Software”). The Site and the App are individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”.

**1\. Introduction.** We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services. “Personal Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address or other contact information.

**2\. Terms of Use.** This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use which is available at \[[reg.meetmatch.biz/files/terms.html](https://reg.meetmatch.biz/files/terms.html)\] (“Terms”). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms.

**3\. Consent and Modification.** By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site and/or Software, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.

**4\. What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.** We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site and/or Software. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:

**4.1. Account.** In order to use certain services that we offer via the Site and/or Software, you may be required to create an account (“Account”). We may offer different options to create an Account, including:

> (a) Online Registration Form: You may choose to complete and submit an online registration form. You will be asked to provide us with certain mandatory information such as your name and email address.
> 
> (b) Third Party Accounts: You may choose to create an Account by clicking on a ‘connect’ or ‘sign-in’ button that we may display on the Site and/or Software for a designated third party website or service (each a “Third Party Account”), including but not limited to, LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter. Doing so will enable you to link your Service Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information) that we will obtain from your Third Party Account and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with your \`Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account.

Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address to instruct you how to confirm your registration. You may also choose to provide further information, such as company you work for and specific topics you are currently interested in.

**4.2. ‘Contact Us’ Information.** If you send us a “Contact Us” request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name and email address.

**4.3. Share with Friends Service.** The Site and/or Software may enable you to invite your friends to use our Services by sending them an invitation email or message. You may do so by: (i) using the Site and/or Software to send or post an invitation message via your Third Party Account; and/or (ii) using the Site and/or Software to send an invitation email to your friend’s external email address (for example, a Gmail address). If you send or post an invitation message, we may collect Personal Information about the recipient such as their email address or their third party website account user name and id.

**4.4. Purchases.** The Site and/or Software may include the option to purchase certain products or services from us. If you choose to make a purchase we will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. This information is fully handled by our sub-processor for payment, Mollie BV. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the order. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third-party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case you acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of said third-party service provider.

**4.5. Log Files.** We may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track user’s movement around the Services, and gather demographic information.

**4.6. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.** Our Services may utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies in order for us to provide our Services and present you with information that is customized for you. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the Services. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.

**4.7. Mobile Device Data.** We may collect limited information from your mobile device in order to provide the Software. Such information may include your mobile device type, mobile device id, and date and time stamps of Software use. In addition, we may deploy tracking technologies within the Software to help us gather aggregate statistics.

**5\. Publicly Available Information.** Your Public Profile and any publicly available content that you post on or via the Services (“User Submissions”) may be publicly available to other users of the Services, and may also be accessed and used by people of the Services. For instance, if you view another user’s profile or ‘like’ a certain event within the Services, such information can be viewed by others. The notices and tools that we provide on the Services should help inform you which information will be made publicly available. If you publish your contact information in any User Submissions or as part of your Public Profile, you may receive unsolicited messages from other users of the Services or the public. We therefore encourage you to only post information that you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.
