#### 11\. Copyright Policy

**11.1. Removal of Content.** It is the policy of MeetMatch to respect the legitimate rights of copyright owners, and we will respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (the “DMCA”), MeetMatch has designated a Copyright Agent (as specified below) to receive notifications of claimed copyright infringement in connection with: (i) the MeetMatch Software and other mobile applications that we license; and/or (ii) the websites that we operate (collectively, the “Service”). Please be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of Service users who are repeat infringers. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide the Copyright Agent with the following information in accordance with the DMCA:

(i) An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright;

(ii) A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed;

(iii) A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service, with enough detail that we may find it. Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly;

(iv) Your address, telephone number and email address;

(v) A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and

(vi) A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

**11.2. Counter-Notification.** If you believe that the material you posted was removed from the Service by mistake, and that you have the right to post the material, you may elect to send us a counter-notification. To be effective the counter-notification must be a written communication provided to our Copyright Agent that includes substantially the following (please consult your legal counsel or see the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. (the “Copyright Act”) Section 512(g)(3) to confirm these requirements):

(i) Your physical or electronic signature;

(ii) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled. Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly;

(iii) A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and

(iv) Your name, address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which MeetMatch may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of infringement or an agent of such person.

**11.3. Misrepresentations.** Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing or was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

**11.4. Copyright Agent.** MeetMatch’s agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement (“Copyright Agent”) can be reached as follows:

Name: MeetMatch NV

A list of any third party open source software and related Third Party Terms is available at \[https://register.meetmatch.biz/files/terms.html\]. If there is a conflict between any Third Party Terms and the terms of this Agreement, then the Third Party Terms shall prevail but solely in connection with the related third party open source software. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, MeetMatch makes no warranty or indemnity hereunder with respect to any third party open source software.

#### 13\. Intellectual Property Rights

**13.1. Ownership.** The Software is licensed and not sold to you under this Agreement and you acknowledge that MeetMatch and its licensors retain all title, ownership rights and Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Software (and its related software). We reserve all rights not expressly granted herein to the Software. “Intellectual Property Rights” means any and all rights, titles and interests in and to any and all trade secrets, patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks, know-how or similar intellectual property rights, as well as any and all moral rights, rights of privacy, publicity and similar rights of any type under the laws or regulations of any governmental, regulatory, or judicial authority, whether foreign or domestic.

**13.2. Content.** The: (i) content on the Software, including without limitation, the text, information, documents, descriptions, products, software, graphics, photos, sounds, videos, interactive features, and services (the “Materials”); (ii) User Submissions; and (iii) trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein (“Marks”, and together with the Materials and User Submissions, the “Content”); is the property of MeetMatch and/or its licensors and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties. “MeetMatch” and the MeetMatch logo are Marks of MeetMatch and its affiliates. All other Marks used on the Software are the trademarks, service marks or logos of their respective owners.

**13.3. Use of Content.** The content on the Software is provided to you “as is” for your personal use only and may not be used, copied, distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed, decompiled or otherwise exploited for any other purposes whatsoever without our prior written consent. If you download or print a copy of the content you must retain all copyright and other proprietary notices contained therein.

#### 14\. Payments

14.1. The License granted hereunder is currently for free, however, we may in the future charge a fee for certain features and/or uses. You will not be charged for any such uses of the Software unless you first agree to such charges, but please be aware that any failure to pay applicable charges may result in you not having access to some or all of the Software.

14.2. Please be aware that your use of the Software may require and utilize internet connection or data access. To the extent that third party service provider or carrier charges for your internet or data usage are applicable, you agree to be solely responsible for those charges.

14.3. Payment information and payment methods provided by event organizers (each, an “Organizer”) are specified and presented at the Software, within the registration process to the applicable event, as set forth by the Organizer. If you wish to purchase tickets through the Software (each such purchase, a “Transaction”), you will be asked to supply certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card information. You agree that all information that you provide in connection with the Transaction will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you at the prices then in effect. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your Transactions. The sale or purchase of tickets to entertainment events may be regulated by certain state, county and city laws or regulations. You acknowledge that complying with laws is your responsibility, and you agree not to hold us liable for your failure to comply with any law or our failure to notify you of, or properly apply, any law. We will comply with law enforcement authorities and may provide them with any and all information you submit to us to assist in any investigation or prosecution they may conduct. You agree that you will only use credit cards belonging to you, friends, colleagues or family members who expressly authorize such use, for the purpose of conducting Transactions. You hereby grant MeetMatch the right to provide any information you submit to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.

14.4. MeetMatch can collect event registration fees using Facilitated Payment Modes (“FPM”), meaning that all monetary payments will be made to the Organizer directly by you. Therefore, you and the Organizer have an independent relationship, which is unrelated to this Agreement or to MeetMatch, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing your agreement and the FPM service. Ticket availability and the price per ticket for a certain event are determined by the Organizer.

**14.5. Cancellation; Refunds Policy.** Before purchasing tickets, we ask you to carefully review your event selection and review the cancellation policy, set forth by the Organizer. The ticket prices, availability, cancellation and refund policy are determined by the Organizer and are set forth throughout the registration process or within the cancellation policy set forth by the Organizers. You may cancel a Transaction at any time by issuing a cancellation notice in writing to the Organizer (using its contact info); however, refunds may or may not be issued for cancelled tickets depending on the cancellation policy set forth by the Organizer during the registration process. If no cancellation policy was set forth by the Organizer, there may be no refunds given. MeetMatch will not be liable for travel or any other expenses that you or anyone else incurs in connection with a cancelled or postponed event. For all types of Transactions, it is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund and cancellation policy to you and to issue you refunds via the Software or otherwise. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between you and the Organizer, and MeetMatch will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the Software or a Transaction. All communications and disputes regarding cancellations, chargebacks and refunds are between you and the Organizer, and MeetMatch will not be responsible or liable in any way for chargebacks in connection with your use of the Software. If you wish to request a refund, you should contact the applicable Organizer directly. You hereby agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund prohibitions in any manner with regard to tickets you purchased.

**14.6. Cancellation and Postponement.** Occasionally, events are canceled or postponed. MeetMatch is not liable for any damages caused to you, should this occur. It is the Organizer’s responsibility to attempt to contact you to inform you of refund or exchange procedures for the event. If the event was moved or rescheduled, the Organizer may set refund limitations. Please contact the Organizer for more information or to request a refund if you cannot attend the rescheduled event.

14**.7. Unlawful Resale of Tickets; Commercial Purposes.** Unlawful resale (or attempted resale), counterfeit or copy of tickets is grounds for seizure and cancellation without compensation. In addition, MeetMatch reserves the right to restrict or deny ticket purchasing privileges to anyone that MeetMatch determines, in its sole discretion, to be in violation of any of the terms of this Agreement.

**15\. Information Description.** We attempt to be as accurate as possible. However, we cannot and do not warrant that the content available on the Software is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. We reserve the right to make changes in or to the content, or any part thereof without the requirement of giving you any notice prior to or after making such changes to the content.

**16\. Privacy.** We will use any personal information that we may collect or obtain in connection with the Software in accordance with our privacy policy which is available at \[https://register.meetmatch.biz/files/MeetMatch\_Privacy\_Policy.html\] (“Privacy Policy”), and you agree that we may do so. Please also be aware that certain personal information and other information provided by you in connection with your use of the Software may be stored on your Device (even if we do not collect that information). You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Device from unauthorized access.

#### 17\. Warranty Disclaimers

17.1. THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND THOSE ARISING BY STATUTE OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

17.3. IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY OTHER APP USER, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH SUCH A DISPUTE. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, BUT HAVE NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR ANY SUCH DISPUTE.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL MEETMATCH BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE, BUSINESS OR REPUTATION, THAT ARISES UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE APP EVEN IF MEETMATCH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

18.2. IN ANY EVENT, MEETMATCH’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL DAMAGES AND LOSSES THAT ARISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THAT RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP, SHALL NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS, IF ANY, ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO MEETMATCH FOR USING THE APP WITHIN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF BRINGING A CLAIM.

**19\.

You agree not to settle any matter subject to an indemnification by you without first obtaining our express approval.

Such Revisions will be supplied according to our then-current policies, which may include automatic updating or upgrading without any additional notice to you. You consent to any such automatic updating or upgrading of the Software. All references herein to the Software shall include Revisions. This Agreement shall govern any Revisions that replace or supplement the original Software, unless the Revision is accompanied by a separate license agreement which will govern the Revision.

We reserve the right, at any time, to: (i) discontinue or modify any aspect of the Software; and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement and your use of the Software with or without cause, and shall not be liable to you or any third party for any of the foregoing.

**24\. Modification.** We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time by sending you a notification and/or publishing the revised Agreement on the Software.
