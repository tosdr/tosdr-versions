Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any amounts (including any Taxes) are required to be withheld by Customer from any amount otherwise payable by Customer to or for the benefit of Tailscale under this Agreement, Customer will: (a) pay an additional amount such that the net amount actually received by Tailscale will, after all such withholdings (including any withholdings to be made in respect of any additional amount payable pursuant to this sentence), equal the full amount of the payment then due; (b) pay, or cause to be paid, to the relevant taxation authority the full amount of such withholdings (including the full amount of any withholdings in respect of any additional payment required to be paid pursuant to this sentence) in accordance with applicable law; and (c) furnish Tailscale as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) with an official receipt (or a certified copy thereof) or such other documentation as is reasonably acceptable to Tailscale evidencing payment of such withholdings to the relevant taxation authority. In connection with this obligation, Customers that are not Canadian companies but that are subject to HST and/or GST must notify Tailscale in advance of making any payments hereunder.
    
    8.6. _Suspension._ Any permitted suspension of the Tailscale Solution by Tailscale pursuant to the Agreement will not excuse Customer from its obligation to make payments under the Agreement.
    
9. **Confidential Information**
    
    9.1. _Definitions._ For the purposes of the Agreement, a Party receiving Confidential Information (as defined below) will be the “**Recipient**”, the Party disclosing such information will be the “**Discloser**” and “**Confidential Information**” means any and all information of Discloser or any of its licensors that has or will come into the possession or knowledge of the Recipient in connection with or as a result of entering into the Agreement, including information concerning the Discloser’s past, present or future customers, suppliers, technology or business, including, where the Discloser is Customer, Customer Data, and, where the Discloser is Tailscale, Tailscale Metadata or Tailscale Solution security reports requested by Customer; provided that Discloser’s Confidential Information does not include, except with respect to Personal Data: (i) information already known or independently developed by Recipient without access to Discloser’s Confidential Information; (ii) information that is publicly available through no wrongful act of Recipient; or (iii) information received by Recipient from a third party who was free to disclose it without confidentiality obligations.
    
    9.2. _Confidentiality Covenants._ Recipient hereby agrees that it will not, except to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under the Agreement: (i) disclose Confidential Information of the Discloser to any person, except to its own personnel or Affiliates that have a “need to know” and that have entered into written agreements no less protective of such Confidential Information than this Section 9, and to such other recipients as the Discloser may approve in writing; (ii) use Confidential Information of the Discloser; or (iii) alter or remove from any Confidential Information of the Discloser any proprietary legend. Each Party will take industry standard precautions to safeguard the other Party’s Confidential Information, which will in any event be at least as stringent as the precautions that the Recipient takes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar type.
    
    9.3. _Exceptions to Confidentiality._ Notwithstanding Section 9.2, Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information: (i) to the extent that such disclosure is required by applicable law or by the order of a court or similar judicial or administrative body, provided that, except to the extent prohibited by law, the Recipient promptly notifies the Discloser in writing of such required disclosure and cooperates with the Discloser to seek an appropriate protective order; or (ii) to its legal counsel and other professional advisors if and to the extent such persons need to know such Confidential Information in order to provide applicable professional advisory services in connection with the Party’s business; or (iii) in the case of Tailscale, to potential assignees, acquirers or successors of Tailscale if and to the extent such persons need to know such Confidential Information in connection with a potential sale, merger, amalgamation or other corporate transaction involving the business or assets of Tailscale.
    
    9.4. _Injunctive Relief_. The Recipient acknowledges that disclosure of any Confidential Information by it except as set forth in Section 9.3 will give rise to irreparable injury to the Discloser or the owner of such information, not adequately compensated by damages. Accordingly, the Discloser will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance against the breach or threatened breach of the undertakings in this Section 9, in addition to any other legal remedies which may be available.
    
    9.5. _Return or Destruction of Confidential Information_. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement each Party will promptly destroy (or, if requested by the other Party in writing, return) all Confidential Information (excluding any Personal Data, which will be governed by the DPA) of the other Party in its possession or control within a reasonable amount of time in accordance with the Recipient’s data destruction practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may retain copies of the Confidential Information of the Discloser as required by applicable law, or to the extent such copies are electronically stored in accordance with the Recipient’s standard backup procedures or record retention policies, so long as such Confidential Information remains subject to the confidentiality provisions set out in this Agreement. Each Party will protect any Confidential Information of the other Party in accordance with this Agreement so long as it retains such Confidential Information.
    
10. **Trial Features** From time to time, Tailscale may, in its sole discretion, invite a Customer to use, on a trial basis, pre-release or beta products or features that are in development and not yet available to all Customers (each, a “**Trial Feature**”). All Customers invited to use one or more Trial Features may use such Trial Features only for internal evaluation purposes in a production environment, and not for any commercial use. No fees shall be payable in connection with the use of such Trial Features. The Trial Features, and all associated conversations and materials relating thereto (including any feedback received from Customer regarding the Trial Features), will be considered Tailscale’s Confidential Information and subject to the confidentiality provisions in this Agreement. Customer agrees that it will not make any public statements or otherwise disclose its use of the Trial Features without Tailscale’s prior written consent. Further, Tailscale makes no representations or warranties regarding the Trial Features. Tailscale may discontinue a Customer’s access to any of the Trial Features at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice to Customer. In such event, Customer shall immediately delete any data or other information it has in its possession related to the Trial Feature. Tailscale may decide not to release a final or commercial version of a Trial Feature in its sole discretion and, if it offers a Trial Feature commercially, may choose not to make it available to all Customers who had access to it as a Trial Feature. In addition to the foregoing, use of a Trial Feature may be subject to additional terms and conditions that Tailscale makes available to Customer prior to Customer’s use of such Trial Feature.
    
11. **Customer Warranties; Disclaimer**
    
    11.1. _Customer Representations and Warranties_.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, TAILSCALE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION, CONDITION OR WARRANTY THAT ANY DATA OR INFORMATION PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER IN CONNECTION WITH CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICE (OR ANY PART THEREOF) IS ACCURATE, OR CAN OR SHOULD BE RELIED UPON BY CUSTOMER FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER.

    14.2. _Termination for Convenience._ Tailscale may terminate the Agreement with respect to the Tailscale Solution or any Order Form at any time and for any reason without liability or penalty by providing advance written notice to Customer. In such event, Tailscale will refund to Customer, on a pro-rata basis, any unused subscription-based Fees prepaid under the Agreement for any period following the effective date of termination. Tailscale may terminate your right to use the Site at any point and for any reason in its discretion, and such termination shall be effective upon notice.
    
    14.3. _Termination for Cause._ If you fail to comply with any provision of the Agreement, Tailscale may terminate the Agreement immediately and retain any fees previously paid by you, if applicable. Upon any such termination, you must cease any further use of the Service. If at any time you are not happy with the Service your sole remedy is to cease using the Service.

16. **Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**
    
    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
    
    16.1. _Initial Dispute Resolution._ Our Customer Support Department is available via the Site to address any concerns you may have regarding the Service. Our Customer Support Department can resolve most concerns quickly to your satisfaction. The Parties shall use their best efforts through this Customer Service process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration.
    
    16.2. _Binding Arbitration._ If the Parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution begins under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement (including their formation, performance and breach), the Parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Streamlined Arbitration and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions.  
      
    Except as set forth in Section 16.5, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of the Agreement are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The Parties agree that the arbitrator may allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the Parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.  
      
    The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, you will be required to pay US$250 to initiate the arbitration. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require Tailscale to pay the additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Tailscale will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed US$75,000. For claims above US$75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases.  
      
    Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator and/or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).  
      
    The Parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS’s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification. The Parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 16 while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction.  
      
    The Parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
    
    16.3. _Location._ If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside of the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, and you and Tailscale agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
    
    16.4. _Class Action Waiver._ The Parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the Parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND TAILSCALE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The Parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.
    
    16.5. _Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims._ Notwithstanding the Parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its Intellectual Property Rights (but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court that are within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court in your state and county of residence. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under the Agreement.
    
    16.6. _30-Day Right to Opt Out._ You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Tailscale Inc., 125-720 King St. West Suite 585 Toronto, ON M5V 3S5. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Tailscale also will not be bound by them.
    
    16.7. _Changes to this Section._ Tailscale will provide 30 days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 30th day. If you continue to use the Site or the Tailscale Solution after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Tailscale does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.  
      
    For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Tailscale agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, NY. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.  
      
    The Terms and the relationship between you and Tailscale shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.
    
17. **General**
    
    17.1. _Statute of Limitations._ You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Service or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
    
    17.2. _Section Titles._ The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
    
    17.3. _Export Restrictions._ Customer agrees not to directly or indirectly export, re-export or import all or any portion of the Service without first obtaining all required licenses, permits and permissions. Tailscale makes no representation or warranty that the Service may be exported without Customer first obtaining appropriate licenses or permits under applicable law, or that any such license or permit has been, will be, or can be obtained.
    
    17.4. _Construction_. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, the Parties’ rights and remedies under the Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity or otherwise. The terms “include” and “including” mean, respectively, “include without limitation” and “including without limitation.” The headings of sections of the Agreement are for reference purposes only and have no substantive effect.
    
    17.5. _Force Majeure._ Neither Party will be liable for delays caused by any event or circumstances beyond that Party’s reasonable control, including acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labour problems (other than those involving that Party’s employees), Internet service failures or delays, or the unavailability or modification by third parties of telecommunications or hosting infrastructure or third-party websites (“Force Majeure Event”).
    
    17.6. _Assignment._ Tailscale may, upon giving written notice to you, assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement to any of its Affiliates or pursuant to a merger, amalgamation or other corporate reorganization or a sale of all or substantially all of its assets relating to that portion of its business that delivers the Service. In this case, such assignee will have and may exercise all the rights, and will assume all of the obligations, of Tailscale under the Agreement, except that the assignment will not release Tailscale from liability for Tailscale’s obligations under the Agreement. Except for such permitted assignment, neither Party may assign the Agreement or any rights or obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of each of the other Party. The Agreement enure to the benefit of and is binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
    
    17.7. _Severability_. Any provision of the Agreement found by a tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable will be severed from the Agreement and all other provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
    
    17.8. _Waiver_. A waiver of any provision of the Agreement will be in writing and a waiver in one instance will not preclude enforcement of such provision on other occasions.
    
    17.9. _Independent Contractors._ Tailscale’s relationship to you is that of an independent contractor, and neither Party is an agent or partner of the other. Neither Party will have, and neither Party will represent to any third party that it has, any authority to act on behalf of the other Party.
    
    17.10. _Entire Agreement._ The Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations or other communications between the Parties, whether written or oral. Any terms and conditions appearing on a purchase order or similar document issued by Customer, or in Customer’s procurement, invoicing, or vendor onboarding portal: (i) do not apply to the Tailscale Solution; (ii) do not override or form a part of this Agreement (including without limitation any Order Form); and (iii) are void.
