The Charges are the prices quoted on our site at the time you submit your order. Your

change your paid subscription plan to a free plan or cancel your subscription. At the time of

automatic renewal, the subscription will be charged to the Credit Card last used by you. You can

Credit Card. If you have not changed to a free plan (if available) or cancelled on our website, you

will be presumed to have authorised us to charge the subscription fee to the Credit Card last used

by you.



If you wish to change the scope of the Services after we accept your order, and we agree to such

change, we will modify the Charges accordingly.



We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices stated for the Services are correct at the time

when the relevant information was entered into the system. However, please see clause 8.7 for

what happens if we discover an error in the price of the Services you ordered.



Our Charges may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order you have already

placed. We may change the price of any Service or charge for use of Services that are currently

available free of charge. Any increase in charges will not apply until the expiry of your then current

billing cycle.

you must pay us such additional amounts in respect of VAT, at the applicable rate, at the same

time as you pay the Charges.



It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Services on our site may be

incorrectly priced. If the correct price for the Services is higher than the price stated on our site,

we will contact you as soon as possible to inform you of this error and we will give you the option

of continuing to purchase the Services at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not

process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the

contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and

notify you in writing. However, if we mistakenly accept and process your order where a pricing

error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a

mispricing, we may cancel supply of the Services and refund you any sums you have paid.

following payment. For any failed or cancelled payments, a 20 Euro administration fee will be

the Contract:

(a) we will contact you as soon as reasonably possible to notify you; and

(b) our obligations under the Contract will be suspended and the time for performance of

our obligations will be extended for the duration of the Event Outside Our Control. We

will arrange a new date for performance of the Services with you after the Event Outside

Our Control is over.



You may cancel the Contract affected by an Event Outside Our Control which has continued for

more than 30 days. To cancel please contact us. If you opt to cancel we will refund the price you

have paid, less the charges for performing the Services up to the date of the occurrence of the

Event Outside Our Control.



16. Non-solicitation



You must not attempt to procure services that are competitive with the Services from any of our

directors, employees or consultants, whether as an employee or on a freelance basis, during the

period that we are providing the Services to you and for a period of six months following

termination of the Contract.



17. Communications between us



When we refer to "in writing" in these Terms, this includes email.



Any notice or other communication given under or in connection with the Contract must be in

writing and be delivered by confirmed email.



A notice or other communication is deemed to have been received by email, at 9.00 am CET the

next Czech Republic working day, after transmission.



In proving the service of any notice, it will be sufficient to prove, in the case of an email, that such

email was sent to the specified email address of the addressee.



The provisions of this clause will not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents

in any legal action.



18. General



Assignment and transfer

(a) We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under the Contract to another

entity.

(b) You may only assign or transfer your rights or your obligations under the Contract to

another person if we agree in writing.



Variation. Any variation of the Contract only has effect if it is in writing and agreed by you and us

(or our respective authorised representatives).



Waiver. If we do not insist that you perform any of your obligations under the Contract, or if we

do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have

waived our rights against you or that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do

waive any rights, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically

waive any right related to any later default by you.



Severance. Each paragraph of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority

decides that any of them is unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in

full force and effect.



Third party rights. The Contract is between you and us. No other person has any rights to enforce

any of its terms.



Governing law and jurisdiction. The Contract is governed by German law and we each irrevocably

agree to submit all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Contract to the exclusive

jurisdiction of the courts of Hannover, Germany.
