**1\. Acceptance of Terms**
---------------------------

Welcome to American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders (“**APFED**,” “**we**” or “**us**”) and our Website Terms of Use (these “**Terms**”).  These Terms are important and affect your legal rights, so please read them carefully.  Note that Section 18 of these Terms contains a mandatory arbitration provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis and limits the remedies available to you in the event of certain disputes.

By accessing or using the website located at [www.apfed.org](https://www.apfed.org/) (“**Site**”), you agree to be bound by these Terms and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference. After reviewing these Terms, please indicate your acceptance by providing information regarding yourself, checking the box, and clicking the “I Agree” button, all at the bottom of the forms on apfed.org.

By accepting these Terms, you represent that you are 16 years of age or older and that, if you have accepted these Terms on behalf of any person or entity, you represent that you have legal authority to do so and that such person or entity agrees to be responsible to us if you or such person or entity violates these Terms. 

If you do not agree to every provision of these Terms, you may not, and we do not authorize you to, access or use the Site or any features provided on the Site.

By accessing or using the Site, you represent and warrant that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Site, or engaged in any activity that could result in suspension or removal from the Site.

These Terms may be revised at any time for any reason, and APFED may provide you notice of these changes by any reasonable means, including by providing notice through the Site.  You can determine when we last updated the Site by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of these Terms.  Except to the extent that your express consent to any revised Terms is required under data protection law, by continuing to access, browse or use the Site, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all the terms incorporated herein by reference.  We strongly recommend that you periodically visit this page of the Site to review these Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you may not access or use the Site.

----------------------------------------

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APFED BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE, INCOME OR PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, LOSS OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF ASSETS OR SECURITIES, OR DAMAGES FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, USER CONTENT, AND LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES), OR THE ORDER, RECEIPT OR USE OF ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THESE TERMS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM APFED, OR FROM EVENTS BEYOND APFED’s REASONABLE CONTROL, SUCH AS SITE INTERRUPTIONS, DELETIONS OF FILES OR EMAILS, ERRORS OR OMISSIONS, DEFECTS, BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO APFED RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SYSTEMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE).

**13\. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**
--------------------------------------------

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH APFED AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

YOU AND APFED AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS, OR THE SERVICES SHALL BE FINALLY DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION GOVERNING CONSUMER DISPUTES.  Arbitration uses a single, neutral arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury); arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in a court case; and the arbitration process and result is subject to very limited review by courts. In an arbitration you have the right, at your expense, to be represented by an attorney of your choosing.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief under these Terms that a court can award under these Terms. You and APFED agree that any in-person arbitral hearing would occur in the United States in the same county and state as your billing address.  APFED further agrees that your filing fee for an arbitration will be capped at the amount set by the American Arbitration Association.  You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and APFED are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and the termination of your use of the services. REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM, YOU AND APFED AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and APFED agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.

**14\. Modifications to the Site**
----------------------------------

We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site (or any features or parts thereof) at any time.

**19\. Severability**
---------------------
