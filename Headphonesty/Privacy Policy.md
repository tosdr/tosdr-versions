### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Headphonesty's websites choose to interact with Headphonesty in ways that require Headphonesty to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Headphonesty gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

Those who engage in transactions with Headphonesty are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.

Headphonesty does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Headphonesty will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Headphonesty discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Headphonesty believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Headphonesty, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Headphonesty website and have supplied your email address, Headphonesty may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Headphonesty and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Headphonesty takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Headphonesty uses cookies to help Headphonesty identify and track visitors, their usage of Headphonesty website, and their website access preferences. Headphonesty visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Headphonesty's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Headphonesty's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If Headphonesty, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Headphonesty goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Headphonesty may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Headphonesty and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Headphonesty collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Headphonesty's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Headphonesty's visitors use its website. From time to time, Headphonesty may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Headphonesty also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on www.headphonesty.com blogs/sites. Headphonesty only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Headphonesty's websites choose to interact with Headphonesty in ways that require Headphonesty to gather personally-identifying information.
