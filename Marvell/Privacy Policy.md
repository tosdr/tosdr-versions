**2\. Legal Bases for the Processing of Your Personal Data**  

Our processing of your Personal Data relies on the following legal bases:

* Based on the necessity to enter into or perform a contract with you:  To the extent that we enter into a contract with you in the context of your use of the Site (governing terms and conditions), your completion of a user registration, your request for customer or user support, your registration or attendance of events or webinars, or your use of similar functionalities of the Site, our related processing of your Personal Data is based on the necessity to enter into or perform such contract;
* Based on legitimate interests: Unless we enter into a related contract with you, our processing of your Personal Data in the context of the following activities is based on the necessity to pursue our legitimate interests to

Ø  administer the Site and provide you with content you access and request (e.g., information posted on the Site, download of content from the Site, etc.);

Ø  promote the safety and security of the Site, our IT connected to the Site and the users of the Site;

Ø  respond to requests you make when filling out a “Contact Me” web form, seeking customer or user support, or contacting us by other means through the Site;

Ø  develop and improve the Site or display personalized advertisements or other personalized content. Detailed information about the analytics and advertising solutions used for these purposes can be found in Section 3 below;

Ø  send you marketing communications as described in Section 3 of the Privacy Statement via email\].  You will be offered the option to opt out of further marketing communications in the context of each marketing communication you receive from us.

**4\. Data Recipients in Third Countries**  

We and many of our affiliated entities and third-party service providers are located in the United States or other jurisdictions outside of the EU/EEA that are not subject to an unqualified adequacy decision by the EU Commission finding them to provide a level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU.

However, to ensure an appropriate level of protection of your Personal Data, we enter into data processing and data transfer agreements with our affiliated entities and third-party service providers outside of the EU/EEA that incorporate the provisions of the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission or implement other appropriate safeguards with them. 

**5\. Data Retention**  

We implement appropriate retention periods for your Personal Data collected or otherwise processed on or through the Site. Personal Data processed in the context of a contract with you will be retained by us for the term of the contract and for a reasonable time afterwards as might be required to determine and settle any related claims. Where our processing of your personal data is based on legitimate interests or the compliance with legal obligations, it will be deleted as soon as the underlying purpose has expired. Personal data processed based on your consent will be deleted if and when you withdraw such consent.

**6\. Your Rights Relating to Your Personal Data**  

Depending on the circumstances and subject to the conditions set out in the applicable law, you have, without limitation, the right to do the following in connection with our processing of your Personal Data:

* Request access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to inquire whether and what kind of Personal Data we hold about you and how it is processed, and to request a copy of such Personal Data, provided always that this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others;
* Request correction and supplementation of the Personal Data that we hold about you that is incorrect, incomplete or out-of-date in light of the purposes underlying the processing;
* Request the erasure of your Personal Data where it is no longer necessary for the purposes underlying the processing, processed based on withdrawn consent, processed for legitimate interests that, in the context of your objection (see below), do not prove to be compelling, or processed in non-compliance with applicable legal requirements;
* Object to our processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests where there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to our use on this ground;
* Where applicable, withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Data with future effect. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer use your Personal Data for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law;
* Request the restriction of our processing of your Personal Data in certain situations where you feel its processing is inappropriate. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy; and
* To the extent technically feasible, request portability of Personal Data you have provided to us, where the processing of such Personal Data is based on consent or a contract with you and is carried out by automated means.

You may enforce your rights (as may be applicable) by contacting us via the contact details stated in Section 1 of the Privacy Statement.

We are committed to working with you to address any privacy concern.  However, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.

**7\. Your Provision of Personal Data to Us**  

Your use of the Site and your provision of Personal Data to us in the process is purely voluntary on your part. Subject to your sole discretion, you can, at any point, cease use of the Site or, where applicable, opt out of certain data processing operations while using the site as described in this Supplemental Statement. An exception applies if and to the extent that you want to enter into or perform a contract with us on or through the Site. In this event, providing us with your related Personal Data is a condition to our ability to enter into the contract with you or provide any contractual services to you.
