IX. **Information on data transfers outside of the EEA.**
---------------------------------------------------------

We mainly process the data you submit within the EEA and the servers located there. Note, however, that TIDIO LLC, as the entity entering into the Agreement with you, is a U.S.-based entity, and therefore some of your data may be transferred from the EEA and/or the United Kingdom and processed in the United States.

**Information for individuals in the EEA and UK  
**Because we operate globally, Tidio may transfer your Personal Information from the EEA or the UK to the United States and other countries. This may include Personal Information that we receive from individuals residing in the EEA or the UK who visit our Websites, use our Services, or otherwise interact with us. When we transfer Personal Information, we rely on the Adequacy Decisions of the European Commission (“EC”), based on Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) and UK Secretary of State,  
based on Article 45 of the UK GDPR and Section 17A of the Data Protection Act 2018 or the EC’s Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office’s International Data Transfer Addendum (“IDTA”), as applicable, supplemented by additional security measures as recommended by the European Data Protection Board.  The EC’s and the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) have determined that the SCCs and IDTA may provide sufficient safeguards to protect personal data transferred outside the EEA and the UK. Where we transfer data, we perform transfer impact assessments (“TIAs”) and continually monitor the circumstances surrounding such transfers to ensure that these maintain, in practice, a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by the EEA and UK data protection laws.    

**Additional information for individuals from the EEA and Switzerland: EU-US Data Privacy Framework** In addition to utilizing SCCs, as part of our commitment to maintaining high data protection standards when transferring Personal Information between EEA/Switzerland and the United States, we participate in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (“EU-US DPF”) and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-US DPF”).  Tidio complies with the EU-US DPF and the Swiss-US DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. We have certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-US DPF Principles (“EU-US DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-US DPF. We have certified to the US Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Swiss-US DPF Principles (“Swiss-US DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-US DPF Principles and/or the  
Swiss-US DPF Principles the Principles shall govern.  Use hyperlinks to learn more about the [Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”)](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/) program and to [view our certification](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search).  

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks, Tidio is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks, should direct their query to [privacy@tidio.net](mailto:privacy@tidio.net). If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We will provide an individual opt-out choice or opt-in for sensitive data before we share your data with third parties other than our agents or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to  
limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written  
request to [privacy@tidio.net](mailto:privacy@tidio.net).  In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement  
requirements.  Tidio’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles. In particular, Tidio remains responsible and liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Tidio proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In compliance with the EU-US DPF Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information transferred to the United States pursuant to the EU/SWISS DPF Principles.  European Union and Swiss individuals with DPF inquiries or complaints should first contact Tidio: Data Protection Officer, [privacy@tidio.net](mailto:privacy@tidio.net). We will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints or disputes regarding the processing of Personal Information within 45 days of receiving your privacy complaint.    
   
Tidio has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU/SWISS DPF Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, Data Privacy Framework Services, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit the [BBB National Programs website](https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-%20consumers/ProcessForConsumers) for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.   If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms, see [DPF Arbitration Procedures](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-%20Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2). Tidio is subject to the jurisdiction of the US Federal Trade Commission for the purposes of DPF enforcement.

**CCPA Correction Request** – You may request that we correct the PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining by sending us a CCPA Request for correction through the channels set forth below. 

**CCPA Deletion Request** – You may request that we delete the PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining and to direct those parties with whom we have shared your data to do the same. However, we may have a basis for the retention of your PI under the CCPA. Our retention rights include (i) to complete transactions and services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated; (ii) for security purposes; and (iii) for legitimate internal business purposes, including to maintain business records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement. Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.

**Making CCPA Requests**

* To make a CCPA request, you or an Authorized Agent (as indicated below) may email us [here](mailto:support@tidio.net?subject=CCPA%20Request), or write us at Tidio LLC, 149 New Montgomery Street (San Francisco, CA 94105 U.S.A.) (Attn: **CCPA Request**).
* **Authorized Agent Request** – As permitted by the CCPA, any request submitted to us is subject to an identification and verification process, and confirmation of the agent’s authority, which may include attestation under penalty of perjury. Absent a power of attorney, we will also require the consumer to verify his or her own identity. We may verify identity based on matching information you provided with data we have maintained on you in our systems. This data could include email address, mailing address, or phone number.

**Third-Party Marketing and Other California Privacy Rights**

* We provide California residents with the option to opt in to sharing of “personal information,” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law, with third parties, other than our affiliates, for such third parties’ own direct marketing purposes. California residents may prospectively withdraw that consent, and/or request information about our compliance with the Shine the Light law, and obtain a disclosure of third parties we have shared information with in accordance with the law for those companies direct marketing purposes and the categories of information shared. To obtain such information, email us [here](mailto:support@tidio.net?subject=Shine-the-Light), or write us at 149 New Montgomery St 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA (Attn: **California Privacy Rights Request**). Requests must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided email address or postal address. As these rights and your CCPA rights are not the same and exist under different laws, you must exercise your rights under each law separately.
* **California Minors** – As noted above, Tidio is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than thirteen (13) years of age.

XIV. **Nevada Residents**
-------------------------

Nevada law allows customers to “opt out” of the sale of certain personal information, called “covered information.” We do not sell covered information as defined in the law, and we have no plans to change that practice. If you want to be notified if we do change that practice, you may email us [here](mailto:support@tidio.net?subject=Nevada%20Opt-Out) and provide your name, Nevada resident address, and email address. We will contact you if there are any changes, and you can complete your opt out at that time. If your contact information changes at any point, contact us in the same manner to update your contact information. We may share your data as explained in this Privacy Policy for different purposes, such as to make your experience and our Application Services better, and those activities are separate from your opt-out request.

XV. Links to Other Sites
------------------------

We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

Our Service may contain links to other websites operated by unrelated companies and persons (“Third-Party Website(s)”). These links are provided for your information only. The inclusion on the Service of any link to a Third-Party Website does not mean that we accept any responsibility for that Third-Party Website, its content or use, or the use of any features, products and/or services made available through that Third-Party Website.

We have no control over Third-Party Websites or any information or materials contained on them and have not investigated, monitored, or checked any Third-Party Websites for accuracy, completeness, or conformance with applicable laws and regulations. We are not responsible for any damages or caused as a result of your use of, or reliance on, Third-Party Websites or any information or materials contained on them. You access and use Third-Party Websites at your own risk.

XVI. Children’s Privacy
-----------------------

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 (“Children”).

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us [here](mailto:support@tidio.net?subject=Children's%20Data). If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

XVII. Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------------

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You can see this from the date of the last update, posted at the beginning of the Privacy Policy. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
