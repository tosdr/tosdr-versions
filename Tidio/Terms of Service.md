Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

Availability and Termination of our Services
--------------------------------------------

**Availability of Our Services.** Our Services may be interrupted, including for maintenance, repairs, upgrades, or network or equipment failures. We may discontinue some or all of our Services, including certain features and the support for certain devices and platforms, at any time. Events beyond our control may affect our Services, such as events in nature and other force majeure events.

**Reservations for Services Operation.** As permitted by applicable law, Tidio reserves the right, without limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of the Services’ security or Tidio’s information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and Conditions and any applicable terms, (iii) use any information obtained by Tidio in accordance with its [Privacy Policy](https://www.tidio.com/privacy-policy/) in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with applicable laws and use and/or disclose any information obtained by Tidio to comply with law enforcement requests or legal requirements in accordance with our [Privacy Policy,](https://www.tidio.com/privacy-policy/) (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and Conditions and any applicable additional terms, and (vi) discontinue the Services, in whole or in part, or, suspend or terminate your access to them, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party. Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to Tidio under these Terms and Conditions or any applicable additional terms. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Services, or upon notice from Tidio, all rights granted to you under these Terms and Conditions or any applicable additional terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Services. The provisions of these Terms and Conditions and any applicable additional terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to Tidio in these Terms and Conditions, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.

**Termination by Us.** We may modify, limit, suspend, or terminate your access to or use of our Services anytime for no reason in our sole and exclusive discretion, especially if you violate the letter or spirit of our Terms or create harm, risk, or possible legal exposure for us, our users, or others. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.

We may also, at our sole and exclusive discretion, partially limit your use of the Services. In particular, this includes our right to disable your access to our technical support, especially when you abuse our support. 

**Termination by You.** You can cancel your recurring subscription at any time to stop further charges to your account. You will maintain access to all of the features in your payment plan until the expiration of your subscription.

**Survival.** The following provisions will survive any termination of your relationship with Tidio: “Licenses,” “Disclaimers,” “Limitation of Liability,” “Indemnification,” “Dispute Resolution,” “Availability and Termination of our Services,” “Other,” and “Special Arbitration Provision for the United States or Canada Users.”

Changes
-------

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is a material we will try to provide at least fifteen (15) days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. You will be notified about changes in Terms and encouraged to review new conditions.

EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN-APPLICABLE TERMS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF NEW TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING-FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE NEW TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.  Any new Terms or additional terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised, or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You can reject any new, revised or additional terms by discontinuing the use of the Service.

* We reserve all rights not expressly granted by us to you. In certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights as a consumer, and our Terms are not intended to limit such consumer legal rights that may not be waived by contract.

Special Arbitration Provision for United States and Canada Users
----------------------------------------------------------------

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS. IF YOU ARE A TIDIO USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, TIDIO REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION. FINALLY, THIS SECTION WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.**

“Excluded Dispute” means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents). For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.

**Federal Arbitration Act.** The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” section, including any question whether a Dispute between Tidio LLC and you is subject to arbitration.

**Agreement to Arbitrate for Tidio Users Located in the United States or Canada.** For Tidio users located in the United States or Canada, Tidio and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes. Tidio and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. Tidio and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.adr.org&sa=D&ust=1526889861088000) . The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, we will reimburse you for all the AAA administrative fees in Disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.

**Opt-Out Procedure.** You may opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt-out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms; and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt-out:

Tidio LLC  
149 New Montgomery St, 4th Floor,  
San Francisco, California 94105  
United States of America

You must include: (1) your name and residence address; (2) the mobile phone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt-out of our Terms’ agreement to arbitrate.

**Small Claims Court.** As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local “small claims” court’s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local “small claims” court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.

**Time Limit to Start Arbitration.** We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.

**No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, or Representative Actions for Users Located in the United States or Canada.** We and you each agree that if you are a Tidio user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people. We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.

**Severability.** If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption “Special Arbitration Provision for the United States or Canada Users” will be null and void as to that Dispute.

**Place to File Permitted Court Actions.** If you opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the “Forum and Venue” provisions in the “Dispute Resolution” section set forth above.

**UCITA.** The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act or any version thereof, adopted by any state in any form (“UCITA”), shall not apply to these Terms and Conditions and, to the extent that UCITA is applicable, the user and Tidio hereby opt-out of the applicability of UCITA.

**Legal Notice for New Jersey Residents.** Under the New Jersey Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice ACT (“TCCWNA”), N.J.S.A. 56:12-14 et seq., consumers may not be offered any written contract which includes any provision that violates any clearly established legal right of a consumer, or responsibility of a seller, as established by state or federal law. In addition, under the TCCWNA, no consumer contract may state that any of its provisions are or may be void, unenforceable or inapplicable in some jurisdictions without specifying which provisions are or are not void, unenforceable or inapplicable in New Jersey. Therefore, the following provisions of these Terms of Use shall not be applicable to New Jersey residents: (i) the provisions concerning limiting the Service’s liability for any loss or damage is not applicable to New Jersey residents to the extent the Service was negligent or has breached its obligation; (ii) the provisions concerning the exclusion or limitation of certain damages is not applicable to New Jersey residents with respect to punitive damages, loss of data, and loss of or damage to property; and (iii) the provisions concerning the indemnification by you is not applicable to New Jersey residents unless you were negligent or have breached these Terms of Use.

**California Consumers.** Please note specific rights available to California Consumers in our [Privacy Policy.](https://www.tidio.com/privacy-policy/)

If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.
