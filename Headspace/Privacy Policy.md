**Effective:** June 17, 2024

If you are visually impaired, have another disability, or seek support in other languages, you may access this Privacy Policy by emailing us at help@headspace.com.

As part of our company values, especially putting members first, we at Headspace are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy in connection with your use of our content and products via our websites, including www.headspace.com (“**Websites**”), our applications, including the Headspace mobile app (“**Apps**”), or other delivery methods (Websites, Apps, and other delivery methods are collectively referred to as our “**Products**”). Headspace may deliver coaching services, psychotherapy services (i.e. therapy), and psychiatry services (collectively the “**Services**”) using the Products or via other delivery methods, as applicable. Headspace provides the Services through its affiliated medical providers and partners, including Ginger.io of California Medical P.C. (“**Ginger Medical**”) or third party medical providers (Ginger Medical and these third party medical providers will be collectively referred to as our “**Care Providers**”). Throughout this Privacy Policy, we will collectively refer to all of our Products and Services as our “**Platform**.” This Privacy Policy covers the “**personal information**,” meaning information about an identified or identifiable individual that is collected through our Product or Services.

Depending on how you interact with us, the following may also apply to you:

* Our Services are delivered by our Care Providers. For those Care Providers in the US, they are classified as covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Headspace is subject to HIPAA as our Care Providers’ business associate. Our Care Providers may provide you an additional privacy notice during enrollment which we encourage you to review. For example, if you receive Services from Ginger Medical, you can access [their Notice of Privacy Practices here](https://www.headspace.com/notice-of-privacy-practices). If you are outside the US and use our international Care Providers, you may still receive an additional privacy notice from them as relevant to the applicable law in your area.
* Some components or features of our Platform may include additional privacy notices, such as an optional feature that uses your personal information in a unique way. Similarly, you may have been given access to our Product or Services in a manner that includes additional terms or privacy notices such as from your employer. The language of those terms and privacy notices supplement this Privacy Policy unless there is a conflict, in which case those additional terms and privacy notices will apply.
* You may follow links contained in our Platform or provided to you by other users to third-party websites or products not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or products. We strongly suggest you review their privacy policies to understand how your personal information is used and stored by those third parties.
* Similar to the above point, you may use single sign-on (SSO) features to access our Platform, such as through your social media accounts or through your employer. That use may be subject to your SSO provider’s terms and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them prior to using those features.
* This privacy policy does not apply to Headspace employees or applicants to Headspace. Applicants can learn about how we use their personal information by reading our [Applicant Privacy Notice here](https://www.headspace.com/applicant-notice), and employees will be provided further details as part of onboarding.

Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information. We also encourage you to review our [end-user terms and conditions here](https://www.headspace.com/terms-and-conditions).

3\. Sharing of personal information
-----------------------------------

We may disclose your personal information with the following categories of third parties:

* **Our service providers.** In some circumstances we may need to disclose your personal information to a third party so that they can provide a service on our behalf, such as to help deliver Products or Services that you have requested. These service providers may include services such as analytics, payment processing, advertising and marketing, website hosting, customer and technical support, and other services. Our service providers have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, based on our instructions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of your personal information, and to not disclose or use your personal information for any other purpose inconsistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
* **Your integrations.** You may connect your account through supported integrations with third parties and we will share your personal information with those third parties. If you do connect an integration, that third party’s terms and privacy policy may apply to the personal information shared as a result and we encourage you to review those before setting up the integration. For example, if you are on iOS, you may connect our Products to Apple’s Health Kit. If you do, iOS Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply, and can be reviewed at www.apple.com/legal/privacy.
* **Community Activity.** If you engage with other Platform users using our community features, we will share some information about you such as your name associated with your comment on a forum or other information you choose to share with other users.
* **Your Benefit Sponsor.** In limited cases, we may provide certain personal information to your Benefit Sponsor, including your name, email address, your registration date, and the date on which you last used our Platform. Generally, we restrict this sharing to not include specific details of your in-app activity or any details about your use of Services, like therapy. This restriction may not apply where sharing some of your activity is necessary for your treatment, payment, or healthcare operations such as if your Benefit Sponsor is your other healthcare provider, health insurance provider, or health plan.
* **Third party business partners.** In limited cases, we may provide certain personal information to third party businesses with which we have a joint promotional relationship, bundled subscription offer, or other trusted partnership. This type of sharing will most often be consistent with your notice, consent, direction, and/or reasonable expectations in light of the circumstances in which you provided the personal information.
* **Third party advertising platforms.** We work with third party platforms who provide us with analytics and advertising services. This includes helping us understand how users interact with our Platform serving advertisements on our behalf to those who may be interested, and measuring the performance of those advertisements.
* **Compliance and harm prevention.** If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceeding, similar legal process, or in order to enforce our agreements with you; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Headspace, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may also disclose personal information where we believe that doing so would be in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process.
* **Affiliates and business transfer.** We may share your personal information with any member of our business group, which includes our subsidiaries and our affiliates including Ginger Medical and its medical professional corporation affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If Headspace, including any of our subsidiaries, brands, or affiliates, is involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or other corporate combination, your personal information may be transferred to the acquiring or surviving entity. If such transfer results in a material change to the use of your personal information, we will provide notice before your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

4\. Data security and retention
-------------------------------

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards, practices, and procedures to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect the security of your personal information against unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or misuse.

No security can be fully guaranteed, though. If you have an account with us and you suspect unauthorized use of your account or its credentials, you should contact us immediately using the contact information in Section 9 below or contact our security team directly at security@headspace.com.

We will keep your personal information for as long as needed to perform our obligations to you, or for as long as legally permitted. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations). For example, we keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account exists so that you may access it.

5\. Your privacy rights
-----------------------

We believe that you should have control of your personal information. To that end we provide the following rights to make requests regarding your personal information. You may make these requests by contacting help@headspace.com or in some cases using features within the Platform:

* **Access.** You have the right to know what personal information we collect about you and how we use it. This Privacy Policy serves to inform you about that collection and use. If we have personal information about you, you may also request a copy of that information.
* **Correction.** You have the right to request the correction of your inaccurate personal information.
* **Portability.** You may request an export of your personal information in a structured and machine readable format such as a .csv or .pdf. Where feasible, we can send that export to a third party you identify.
* **Deletion.** You have the right to request, under certain circumstances, the deletion of your personal information that we collect.
* **Restriction.** You have the right to request that Headspace restrict the use of your personal information in certain circumstances. Please note that in some cases we may not be able to place a restriction due to the use being necessary for Product functionality or delivery of the Services.
* **No retaliation or discrimination.** You have the right not to receive discriminatory or retaliatory treatment for making a request.

Upon receiving your request, we may ask for additional information from you in order to verify the request or confirm how you would like to proceed. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable request without undue delay. If we require an extended amount of time, we will inform you using the email associated with your account or the email you used to make the request.

We do not charge a fee to process your verifiable request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or clearly unfounded. If we determine that your request requires a fee, we will tell you why and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Your rights are not absolute, and exceptions may apply. These exceptions can arise from different factors including our legal obligations, the rights of others, your or another’s safety, and our ability to bring or defend against legal claims. Additionally, we will not fulfill your request if you do not provide sufficient information to verify your identity or to verify that a third party making the request is authorized to act as your representative.

Some US jurisdictions provide residents with certain rights with respect to their personal information as defined under applicable law. These rights are subject to the specific laws of that jurisdiction and that certain other rights might apply. Please review our Supplemental Notices, including our [Privacy Notice for EU and UK](https://www.headspace.com/privacy-policy#10a), our [Privacy Notice for California](https://www.headspace.com/privacy-policy#10b), and our [Privacy Notice for Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada](https://www.headspace.com/privacy-policy#10c) for more information on rights and terms specific to your location or place of residence.

If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with their personal information without parental consent, please contact us at help@headspace.com and we will take steps to remove that personal information from our servers.

**Your California privacy rights.** The CCPA provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and sensitive personal information.
