2.3 SUBSCRIPTIONS & PURCHASES
-----------------------------

(a) **Free Trials.** You may have access to a free trial period of certain Products (“Free Trial”). You are only allowed one Free Trial regardless of your subscription method. We reserve the right to determine eligibility for Free Trials, which may vary based on factors including the Product or Service you select and whether you have redeemed a Free Trial previously. Free Trials automatically convert to a paid annual or monthly subscription term after a certain period of time. You can disable the automatic conversion by following the cancellation instructions set forth in Section 3 prior to the date of conversion.  
  
(b) **Automatically Renewing Subscriptions.** Members may access the Products or Services via a subscription fee-based program (“Subscription”). Subscriptions may be available via monthly or annual options (“Subscription Term”). For the purposes of our monthly and annual subscriptions, a month constitutes 30 calendar days and a year constitutes 365 calendar days. Subscriptions may be charged separately for Products and Services. If you activate a Subscription, you authorize Headspace to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis all accrued sums (“Subscription Fee”) on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. Your account will be charged automatically on the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Product or Service (“Subscription Billing Date”) for all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period. The Subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your Subscription or Headspace terminates your Subscription or your account.  
  
(c) **Subscription Cancellation.** You may cancel your Subscription at any time, but you must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. See more about cancellation at Section 3.  
  
(d) **No Refunds on Subscriptions.** Refunds cannot be claimed for any partial Subscription Term. Headspace will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information) (“Payment Method”). You will only have access to the Products and Services while your Subscription is active and subsisting.  
  
(e) **Subscription Methods.** You may subscribe via: (i) purchasing a subscription to the Products or Services from the Website, within the Apps, where allowed by the App marketplace partners, (ii) a Benefit Sponsor (as defined in Section 2.5) or (iii) a bundle with one or more of our bundle subscription partners. Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone application, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Apple’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. If you purchase a subscription through the Google Play store, the sale is final and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Google’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. If your Subscription is through a Benefit Sponsor or one or more of our bundle subscription partners, additional terms and policies may apply, and your Subscription may be paid for, partially paid for, or managed by the Benefit Sponsor or the bundle subscription partner.  
  
(f) **Gift Subscriptions.** “Gift Subscriptions” are pre-paid memberships to the Products. A person who purchases the gift is the “Giftor.” A person who receives and redeems a Gift Subscription is the “Recipient.” Gift Subscriptions are paid for by a one-time upfront payment. Once bought, the Giftor will receive an Order confirmation and receipt. The Gift Subscription will be sent to the Recipient on the Giftor’s specified date with a gifting code to redeem the Gift Subscription. Gifting codes can only be used once in the country for which they were purchased and cannot be redeemed for cash, resold or combined with any other offers, including free trial unless expressly stated otherwise. Please note that gifting codes cannot be redeemed if the Recipient has already purchased a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store,our iPhone application, the Google Play Store, or our Android application. We will automatically bill the Payment Method that the Giftor provided for any purchased Gift Subscriptions at the time of purchase, not upon delivery to or redemption by Recipient. There are no refunds or other credits for Gift Subscription that are not redeemed. Headspace will notify the Recipient prior to the end of the Gift Subscription that the gift period is about to expire. Headspace is not responsible if a Gift Subscription is lost, stolen or used without permission.  
  
(g) **Purchases.** You may access some Products or Services by paying Headspace or our App marketplace partners a non-recurring fee at the time of registration (“Purchase”). If you make a Purchase, you authorize Headspace or our App marketplace partners, as applicable, to charge all accrued sums (“Fees”) on the payment due date for the accrued sums. Your account will be charged automatically on the date when you purchase the Product. Please note that the sale is final for all Purchases, and we will not provide a refund.  
  
(h) **Discounts.** Headspace may offer certain special discount pricing options (the “Special Discount Pricing Options”). Such Special Discount Pricing Options will only be available to qualified users (the “Qualified Users”). Headspace reserves the right to determine if you are a Qualified User in our sole discretion. Additional terms may apply to such Special Discount Pricing Options.  
  
(i) **Prices in US Dollars and Euros include local taxes.** Prices in Pound Sterling include VAT unless otherwise stated. You agree not to hold us responsible for banking charges incurred due to payments on your account. If payment is not received by us from the Payment Method you provided, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.

2.4 PAYMENT TERMS
-----------------

(a) Your use of the Products and Services may require you to pay fees. We reserve the right to determine pricing for the Products and Services. The fees you owe may vary based on many factors, including but not limited to your employer, healthcare provider, health plan or other Benefit Sponsor’s agreement with us, or the coverage offered by your applicable health insurance provider. We are not responsible for whether your health insurance offers any amount of coverage for the Products and Services. We will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on our Website up-to-date.  
  
(b) You are responsible for all applicable fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes, unless otherwise stated in your Benefit Sponsor terms and conditions or otherwise agreed to in writing between the parties.

You agree to promptly notify Headspace of any changes to your Payment Method while any payments remain outstanding. You authorize Headspace or a third-party payment processor to charge all fees for the Products and Services, including all applicable taxes, to the Payment Method. If you pay any fees with a credit card, we (or a third-party payment processor) may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit to cover your purchase. If we use a third-party payment processor, such as Stripe or Zuora, their use of your personal information is subject to their applicable terms of service and privacy policy. For Stripe, those terms are available at [https://stripe.com/legal](https://stripe.com/legal) and [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy).  
  
(c) In the course of your use of the Products or Services, Headspace and its third-party payment processor may receive and use updated credit card information from your credit card issuer to prevent your Subscription from being interrupted by an outdated or invalid card. This information is provided to Headspace and Headspace’s third-party payment processor at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt-out of the update service. Should you desire to do so, please contact your credit card issuer. You agree not to hold us responsible for banking charges incurred due to payments on your account.

2.5 BENEFIT SPONSORS
--------------------

Many groups, including but not limited to employers, healthcare providers, health plans, universities, government entities, municipalities or hospitals (“Benefit Sponsor” or “Benefit Sponsors”) purchase and introduce the Products and Services to their employees, eligible dependents and members. In some cases, our Benefit Sponsors may supplement these Terms with their own terms and conditions, which may include additional terms around subscription redemption, usage or supplementary payment for access to Products and Services. In such event, the Benefit Sponsor terms and conditions will also apply to your use of the Products and Services. In the event of any conflict with such additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms will prevail.

9.1 Meditation Assumption of Risk
---------------------------------

While there is research that meditation can assist in the prevention and recovery process for a wide array of conditions as well as in improving some performance and relationship issues, Headspace makes no guarantees that the Products and Services provide a physical or therapeutic benefit. There have been rare reports where people with certain psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression have experienced worsening conditions in conjunction with intensive meditation practice. People with existing mental health conditions should speak with their health care providers before starting a meditation practice.

9.2 Coaching Assumption of Risk
-------------------------------

If you access and engage with our mental health coaching service, you will work with mental health coaches who will provide personal support, encouragement and motivation (“Coaches”). The Coaches who provide the mental health coaching services do not provide medical advice, professional clinical counseling or other clinical or psychotherapy services. None of the advice provided by the Coaches, the Website or the Products should be considered medical or clinical advice and none of such information is intended as medical or clinical advice. You should always talk to your physician or other other healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment, including information regarding which drugs or treatment may be appropriate for you. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking professional advice because of information you have read on our Website, Apps or received through a Coach. Do not stop taking any medications without speaking to your physician or other healthcare professional. The information provided in or through our Website, Apps or the Coaches is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment that can be provided by your doctor or physician, nurse, or any other medical or clinical healthcare professional.

14\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION & BINDING ARBITRATION
---------------------------------------------

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH HEADSPACE, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM HEADSPACE, INCLUDING A LIMITATION ON THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. FOR PROCEDURES RELATED TO MASS ARBITRATIONS, PLEASE REVIEW [SECTION G](https://www.headspace.com/terms-and-conditions#APMA), BELOW.

(a) Jury Trial Waiver. Except where prohibited by law, you and Headspace waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and Headspace elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Headspace over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Headspace waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge. ‍‍  
  
(b) Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND HEADSPACE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Headspace are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 15.9 below. ‍  
  
(c) Informal Dispute Resolution. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Headspace, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us via email to help@headspace.com or at our mailing address at Headspace, ATTN: Legal, 2417 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 9040, and providing us with your email address. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days after submission, you or Headspace may bring a formal proceeding subject to these Terms.  
  
(d) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products and Services, including claims related to privacy or data security, will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Headspace retain the right: (1) to bring an individual action informally (as provided in section c above) or in small claims court, or (2) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ‍‍All submissions to the arbitrator, the proceedings, and the award shall be confidential, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or as otherwise required by law. ‍  
  
(e) Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The then-current version of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) will govern the arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. ‍  
  
If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution. ‍  
  
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Headspace. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Headspace for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. ‍  
  
(f) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, including any unconscionability challenge or other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable, or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will also have the exclusive authority to determine the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Headspace. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under Applicable Law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Headspace.  
  
(g) Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitrations. These Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitrations (in addition to the other provisions of this arbitration provision and the applicable AAA Rules) shall apply if twenty-five (25) or more similar disputes are asserted against Headspace or against you by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (collectively "Mass Arbitration"). These Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitrations are designed to lead to the streamlined and cost-effective resolution of claims and to ensure that large volume filings do not impose unnecessary burdens or impediments to the resolution and cost-effective adjudication of similar claims. You understand, acknowledge, and agree that Mass Arbitrations may delay resolution of your dispute. The parties agree that as part of initiating a Mass Arbitration, their counsel shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of Disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties' and the AAA's resources.  
  
If at least one hundred (100) disputes are submitted as part of the Mass Arbitration, counsel for each party shall each select fifty (50) disputes to be filed, assigned to different arbitrators (no arbitrator shall shall be assigned more than 3 disputes) and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of this process. The remaining disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties shall participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining disputes, and Headspace shall pay the mediator's fee. If counsel cannot agree on a mediator, one will be selected by the Arbitrator.  
  
If at the end of the process described in the immediately preceding paragraph, twenty-five (25) or more similar disputes have not been resolved, then the remaining disputes shall be arbitrated subject to the AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings and the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule. If fewer than twenty-five (25) disputes remain, the remaining disputes shall proceed individually.  
  
(h) Enforceability. If any portion of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms and severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 14.  
  
(i) Opt-out. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. If you do so, neither you nor Headspace can force the other to arbitrate. To opt-out, you must notify Headspace in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and mailing address, and the email address you used to set up your Headspace account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to one of the following physical or email addresses: Headspace, ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 2417 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90404; or ADR@headspace.com. If you opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate, the opt-out shall not waive or affect any other portion of these Terms.  
  
(j) Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Headspace.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Products and Services, and you will defend and indemnify Headspace, your employer, your health plan, or provider (as applicable) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the “Headspace Entities”) from and against any claim brought by a third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or connected with: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Products or Services; (b) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement referenced in these Terms, or any Applicable Law; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party. The foregoing indemnification obligation is subject to a Headspace Entity promptly informing you in writing of any such claim, demand, action, or suit; provided that any failure to so inform you will not prejudice your obligation of indemnity, except to the extent materially prejudiced thereby. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.

15.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE HEADSPACE ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY HEADSPACE ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE. ‍

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR AN ASSUMPTION OF RISK, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

15.4 NO WAIVER

These Terms and any additional terms or policies expressly referred to in these Terms constitute the whole agreement between us and supersede all previous oral or written discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between us relating to the Products and Services. We each acknowledge that neither of us relies on, or will have any remedies in respect of, any representation or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms or the additional terms or policies expressly referred to in these Terms. Each of us agrees that our only liability in respect of those representations and warranties that are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently or negligently) will be for breach of contract. Nothing in this Section limits or excludes any liability for fraud.

15.8 THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
-----------------------

A person who is not party to these Terms will not have any rights under or in connection with these Terms, except as described in Section 11 (DMCA).

15.9 EXCLUSIVE VENUE
--------------------

To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Headspace agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products and Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products and Services will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Headspace consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.

15.10 CHOICE OF LAW
-------------------

The laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims, except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.

‍15.11 SEVERABILITY
-------------------

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. ‍  
  
Headspace is located at 2417 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90404.
