Welcome to this Digimedia.com, L.P. (“Digimedia”) website. This policy describes the information collected on this website and how it may be used and/or shared. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you may not utilize this website.

Some Digimedia websites may collect personal information when you choose to voluntarily provide it via an email or when you complete and submit a contact form. This type of information may include your name, company name, address, email address, and/or phone number.

  
Regarding IP addresses and other Data.  
Digimedia and/or third parties may collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser user agent, referral website, and a cookie id.  Information collected may include:

* Website traffic (for example: the domain name and host from which you access the internet and the internet address of the website from which you came to ours),
* Statistical data and analytics (for example: the date and time you access our website, the keywords and/or links clicked, and/or the pages you visit),
* Browsing behavior (for example: the pages you visit, the services or products you sought); and/or

Regarding cookies.  
Digimedia and/or third parties may be placing or reading “cookies” on your internet browser. Cookies are bits of text transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your browser. They allow Digimedia and/or third party systems to recognize your browser, remember your information and link your activities to you. Should you block or disable these cookies, this website may not work and/or appear as intended. Nevertheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following instructions related to your browser.

  
Regarding use of SSL.  
Some Digimedia websites may utilize SSL, the current industry standard encryption protocol. You will know you are on such an SSL page when you see a picture of a closed lock at the bottom or top of some Web browsers. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to look at the address or URL of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select “Properties”.) These secure SSL encrypted pages have URLs that start with https:// instead of http://.

Digimedia may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, to comply with a legal process served on Digimedia and/or this website, and/or to protect the property and/or people of Digimedia, third parties, or the public.
