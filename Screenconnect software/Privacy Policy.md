Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site; however, session cookies are held temporarily in your computer's memory and disappear after you close your browser or shut off your computer.

If you have arrived at any ConnectWise Website by clicking on a banner ad for one of ConnectWise's products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie contains an identification number for the advertisement that you clicked on, and it helps ConnectWise determine which of its ads attracts the most visitors. If you choose to request further information from us about ConnectWise's products and services, the Personal Information that you provide in that request will be linked to the Personal Information in the session cookie.

In order to better understand how our sites are used, ConnectWise Websites may also use persistent cookies along with other Personal Information collected in our servers' files (e.g., IP Address, referring URLs, etc.). Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you reject or block cookies, ConnectWise Websites may not function as intended.

The Personal Information ConnectWise collects from these commercial sources may be combined and cross-referenced with Personal Information we collect through our Services. We use this Personal Information for communication purposes to provide direct marketing materials for our business customers or prospects.

From time to time, we may also ask our partners or clients to voluntarily provide us with the email addresses of contacts of other organizations, so they too can benefit from the various products and services offered by ConnectWise and ConnectWise's trusted affiliates. Where we do, we will confirm that they have the permission to pass on these details to us.

For example, we, address any enquiries or complaints you may have, endeavor to improve the Services we provide, or provide you with information about other products and services we offer that we think you may be interested in.

_For Direct Marketing._ If we have the right to do so, we will use your Personal Information for the purposes of direct marketing communications to your organization, such as by adding your contact and other details to a marketing database. Where we do, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out in accordance with section III.

_For Internal and Service-Related Purposes._ We may use any Personal Information we collect through the Services and/or any ConnectWise Websites for internal and service-related purposes, including providing it to third parties as necessary to allow us to provide the Services, maintain or improve ConnectWise Website security, and/or invoicing for example.

_Anonymized and Aggregate Data._ From time to time, we will aggregate Personal Information collected through our Services for analytics purposes, product improvement purposes and other service-related purposes.

###### **How We May Disclose Personal Information Collected through Our Services and ConnectWise Websites**

We may share Personal Information with the following categories of recipients and/or in the following circumstances:

_With Our Group Companies including those listed in Schedule 1, Third-Party Vendors and Service Providers._ As appropriate, we may share Personal Information with any of our group companies including those listed in Schedule 1, vendors and/or service providers in connection with the provision or marketing of the Services, ConnectWise Websites. These third parties have access to Personal Information to the extent necessary to permit them to do their jobs, however, they are bound by confidentiality agreements before any Personal Information is provided to them, and they are restricted from using the Personal Information for other purposes.

For Personal Information previously transferred to us from EEA countries and UK under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, we will remain liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles if our agents or service providers process such Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, unless we will prove that we are not responsible. A list of service providers and partners that we use with ConnectWise Websites is available on ConnectWise’s Privacy Center.

_As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures._ We may disclose Personal Information: if we believe it is necessary: to comply with national security or law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; to respond to your requests; to prevent or address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others, or to protect the vital interests of others.

_Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers._ If we are involved in a potential or actual merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider Personal Information collected through the Services or ConnectWise Websites (or both) may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.

Other than as stated in this Privacy Notice, we will not release Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties, and we will not cross-reference Personal Information collected through one Client’s use of our Services with that of any other Client or entity.

###### **How We Use Personal Information Collected for Targeted Advertising.**

We share Personal Information with companies involved in targeted (i.e. interest-based) advertising. Targeted advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time through the use of Cookies and other devices. This targeted advertising consists of ConnectWise \[and third-party ads\] that are personalized and displayed on ConnectWise Websites and through other channels. We share various types of de-identified Personal Information (i.e. Personal Information that does not disclose your name) to enable interest-based advertising.

You have the option to restrict the use of Personal Information for targeted advertising and to opt-out of receiving targeted ads.

You can control whether companies serve you targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (U.S.) [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (EU). The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser.

As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. If you block browser cookies, some parts of ConnectWise Websites may not function correctly. Also, blocking cookies will not stop third parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.

Social Network Widgets. ConnectWise Websites may include social network sharing widgets that provide Personal Information to their associated social networks or third parties about your interactions with ConnectWise Websites that you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget. Personal Information may be transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address, and the URL of the web page where widget appears. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use, and share.

###### **How do we transfer and store your Personal Information?**

ConnectWise Websites Services and systems use servers located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, the Personal Data we collect will be processed and stored in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the data protection and privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country where you are located.

-----------------------------------------

If you wish to request access to, correction, or deletion of Personal Information you have submitted through the ConnectWise Websites, you can log into your account or contact ConnectWise at [privacy@connectwise.com](mailto:privacy@connectwise.com). If you are located in the EEA or the UK, you may have additional rights which we have set out in Section 6 below.

###### **Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**

ConnectWise will use Personal Information only for the purpose of or in ways compatible with the purposes for which it was collected.

###### **Information Retention**

We keep Personal Information we need to provide our Services only for as long as we have a valid business purpose, in accordance with applicable law and our Client agreements. For example, we retain Personal Information for as long as it is needed to provide you with Services you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will delete it. If immediate deletion is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible or unless as otherwise required by law.

###### **User Choices**

We include an “unsubscribe” hyperlink in ConnectWise marketing emails for those users who wish to stop receiving email communication from ConnectWise. The hyperlink will connect to one the ConnectWise Websites, which will confirm the email address that has been automatically unsubscribed and will no longer receive emails from ConnectWise.

Security

###### **Legal Basis for processing your Personal Information**

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We normally collect Personal Information from you only where we need the Personal Information to perform our contract for our Services with our Clients, where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided these interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms), or otherwise if we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you, such as Know Your Customer checks or tax information.

If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to contact you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are and before doing so will ensure that we have considered your rights and interests

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us at [privacy@connectwise.com](mailto:privacy@connectwise.com).

ConnectWise complies with the Australian Privacy Principles as set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (“Privacy Act”) regarding the collection, storage, use and disclosure of Personal Information from Australian users.

In addition to the uses set out in the section titled “How We Use Information Collected through Our Services and ConnectWise Websites”, we may also use your information, including Personal Information, for a secondary purpose that is related to a purpose for which we collected it, where you would reasonably expect us to use your Personal Information for that secondary purpose.

Under the Privacy Act, we have an obligation (the “Obligation”) to take reasonable steps, in the circumstances, before disclosing Personal Information to an overseas recipient to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach privacy laws in relation to that information. However, should we obtain your consent to disclose your Personal Information to an overseas recipient, the Obligation does not apply.

These risks may include the overseas recipient not being subject to any privacy obligations or privacy principles similar to the APPs and the overseas recipient being subject to foreign law that could compel the disclosure of your Personal Information to a third party, such as an overseas authority.
