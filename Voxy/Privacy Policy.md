**Accountability for Onward Transfer**

In the event Voxy discloses Personal Data covered by this Policy to a non-agent third party, it will do so consistent with any notice provided to Data Subjects and any choice they have exercised regarding processing and disclosure. Voxy will only disclose Personal Data to third parties that have given us contractual assurances that they will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Policy and the Principles and that they will process Personal Data for limited and specific purposes consistent with any consent provided by the individual. If Voxy has knowledge that a third party to which it has disclosed Personal Data covered by this Policy is processing such Personal Data in a way that is contrary to this Policy and/or the Principles, Voxy will take steps to prevent or stop such processing. Voxy complies with the Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

**Security**

Voxy has put in place technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data covered by this Policy from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures take into account the risks involved in the processing, the nature of the Personal Data, and the state of the art and best practices in the industry for security and data protection.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**

Voxy will only collect Personal Data covered by this Policy that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used, and only use such Personal Data in a way that is compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized. Voxy will take reasonable steps to ensure that such Personal Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

**Access**

Data Subjects have the right to access Personal Data about them that is covered by this Policy and to correct, amend, or delete such Personal Data if they can demonstrate that it is inaccurate or incomplete (except when the burden or expense of providing access, correction, amendment, or deletion would be disproportionate to the risks to the Data Subject’s privacy, or where the rights of persons other than the Data Subject would be violated). Data Subjects may also provide instructions, including withdrawal of consent they may have given, regarding the processing or disclosure of such data.

Data Subjects should note that before Voxy is able to provide them with any access to information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete your personal data, Voxy may ask the Data Subject to verify the identity and to provide other details to help Voxy to respond to the request. Voxy will contact a Data Subject within 30 days of a request to [support@voxy.com](mailto:support@voxy.com)

**Enforcement; Recourse**

Inquiries and complaints relating to Voxy ’s treatment of Personal Data and its compliance with the Principles may be directed to:

[datacontroller@voxy.com](mailto:datacontroller@voxy.com)

or

Voxy, Inc 64 Bleecker St. #241 New York, NY 10012-2410 (212) 529-7600 Attention: Chief Technical Officer

Voxy will respond to any such inquiries or complaints within forty-five (45) days. In the event that Voxy fails to respond or its response is insufficient or does not address the concern, Voxy has registered with American Arbitration Association/International Centre for Dispute Resolution (AAA/ICDP) to provide independent third party dispute resolution at no cost to the complaining party. To contact AAA/ICDP and/or learn more about the company’s dispute resolution services, including instructions for submitting a complaint, please visit: [https://go.adr.org/dpf\_irm.html](https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html)

Complaining parties may also, in absence of a resolution by Voxy and AAA/ICDP, seek to engage in binding arbitration through the DPF channel.

Voxy also commits to periodically reviewing and verifying the accuracy of this Policy and the company’s compliance with the Principles, and remedying issues identified. All employees of Voxy that have access to Personal Data covered by this Policy in the U.S. are responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this Policy. Failure of a Voxy employee to comply with this Policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
