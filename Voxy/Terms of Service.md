The failure of Voxy to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and any supplemental terms, policies, rules and guidelines posted on the Site or in connection with the Content or Services, shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under the Terms and any supplemental terms, policies, rules and guidelines posted on the Site or in connection with the Content or Services, without the prior written consent of Voxy, and any assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be null and void.
