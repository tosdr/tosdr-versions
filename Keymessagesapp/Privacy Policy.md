Very very good app, I've been a user for 2 years now and definitely worth the premium. I only have one complaint, When I receive a text from an unopened sender, usually the bank for authentication. I don't receive the latest message in the pop-up notification, I get the previous unopened massege which is annoying since I have to press on the notification and go into the app manually to check the code instead of seeing it clearly in the pop up. I hope you can fix this.

Very good now. I like it a lot! Have used it for years now. It is foolproof in blocking any SMS from anyone not in your contacts list. It does not ever let a stray text in. With some keyboards for some reason you can't see what you're typing in landscape mode until you rotate the phone and then rotate back again, a hit and miss situation. Would like to see that corrected and it would be great if we could put emojis right on other people's texts. But like I said it never fails even once to block.

Does what it promises but runs slow Like many of you, I was getting multiple spam messages a day (for me, from WinRed). It got to the point that I was ready to change my number. This app saved me. It sends messages from unknown numbers into a separate list that you can check later. At the end of the day, I can check what I call the "moron net" and see what was caught. The only reason that I am not giving this app 5 stars is because it started operating very slowly. If they fix it, 5 starts
