Very very good app, I've been a user for 2 years now and definitely worth the premium. I only have one complaint, When I receive a text from an unopened sender, usually the bank for authentication. I don't receive the latest message in the pop-up notification, I get the previous unopened massege which is annoying since I have to press on the notification and go into the app manually to check the code instead of seeing it clearly in the pop up. I hope you can fix this.

Been using this app for years. Does great with blocking spam texts (best feature: you can block based on word content, eg "Trump", "Biden", "election", etc). But the app is buggy and often crashes. It's also slow, and sometimes fails to download a text, which can be very annoying. I wish the app didn't run so poorly.

The only app I've found to filter by content! I get spam from services which use the same sms provider as my bank, so I can't block by number. This app saves me from 20-30 interruptions per day. It's not the prettiest app, and there are features I miss like swipe-to-archive, but only cave-dwellers and bots actually use sms these days, so it will do.
