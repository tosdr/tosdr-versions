Our website at [https://www.thenational.academy/teachers](https://www.thenational.academy/) and [https://thenational.academy/#pupils](https://www.thenational.academy/#pupils) provides two collections of lesson content, which are made available on different licences.

Lesson content consists of digital materials provided on this website including, but not limited to:

This is made available to you on a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited licence to use for non-commercial educational purposes. Where Oak allows, lessons (consisting of slides, quizzes, and worksheets) may be downloaded by the user for the aforementioned purposes; however, no licence is granted for the download, recording or reproduction of lesson videos for any reason.

* **Collection 2: Lesson content which has been published after September 2022**

Lesson content published after 1st September 2022 is made available to use under an [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) (OGL) v3.0, except where otherwise stated.

Please see our [Guide to website licensing](https://support.thenational.academy/a-guide-to-our-website-licensing) for further help in identifying those resources which contain third-party copyright or other licensing restrictions and how you can correctly use this content.

However, lesson content (including third-party content) is always available for teachers to use for non-commercial educational purposes in the UK. For all other uses, users must comply with the terms of the licence marked or contact the rightsholder directly.

* Oak's AI lesson planning assistant endeavours to make quality lesson output across a wide range of subjects; however, the quality and depth of content may vary between subjects, particularly in certain subject areas such as mathematics and modern foreign languages (MFL).

* Users must exercise professional judgement and expertise when utilising the content, especially in adapting and revising materials to keep pace with educational advancements and specific learning objectives.
