**Terms of Service**
====================

If your usual residence is outside of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland

**Please read carefully:** These Terms of Service (these “**Terms**”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Bending Spoons Operations S.p.A., with offices at Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy, VAT, tax code and registration number with the Milan Monza Brianza Lodi Company Register 13368510965, REA number MI 2718456 (collectively with its successors in interest and permitted assigns, “**Bending Spoons**,” “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”). For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” refer to any customer or end user of the Apps, any visitor to the Sites, or any person who otherwise accesses or uses our Service. These Terms govern your access to and use of our websites where these Terms are posted (the “**Sites**”), our mobile applications (each, an “App” and, collectively, the “**Apps**”), and our related content, products, and services (collectively, and together with the Sites and the Apps, the “**Service**”).

**THESE TERMS CONTAIN VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU. THESE TERMS ALSO CONTAIN PROVISIONS REGARDING THE AUTOMATIC RENEWING OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.**

**THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT AND CLASS-ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS YOU AND BENDING SPOONS AGREE TO RESOLVE MOST DISPUTES IN BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND NOT BY MEANS OF A CLASS ARBITRATION, A CLASS ACTION, ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR A JURY TRIAL. (SEE SECTION** **18 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION)). YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE WHEN THESE TERMS ARE NOTIFIED TO YOU; INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTING OUT ARE IN SECTION** **18 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION) BELOW.**

By downloading, installing or using the Service in any manner, you agree to these Terms and you agree to comply with and be bound by any applicable specific, supplemental or third-party licenses or terms when using the Service.

**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS AND IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SERVICE, CANCEL ANY ACCOUNT, AND IMMEDIATELY UNINSTALL AND DELETE ANY COPIES OF ANY APPS OR SOFTWARE INCLUDED IN THE SERVICE IN YOUR POSSESSION.**

These Terms were originally drafted in English. If there is any conflict between the English-language version of these Terms and a version translated into another language, the English-language version will prevail.

If you have questions or complaints with respect to these Terms or our Service, visit our [support center](https://support.bendingspoons.com/) or the App-specific support pages linked below.

1. **Changes to the Terms and the Service**
    

We may update these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion (for example, when we remove or release new features, technologies, or services, to comply with legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements, or in response to exceptional or unforeseen circumstances). In such cases, we will take reasonable measures to inform you, in accordance with the significance of the changes performed, for example, by revising the date at the top of the updated Terms, via email or as a pop-up or push notification within the Service. It is your responsibility to review the Terms regularly, and to check the Service for updates to these Terms regularly. Unless otherwise noted, the updated Terms will be effective as of the time at which we post the updated Terms in the Service. By continuing to access or use our Service after updates become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must immediately stop using our Service, uninstall and delete any copies of any Apps or any software included in the Service in your possession, and cancel your subscription and any account.

We may also update, change, suspend or discontinue the Service (or any part, content or feature) at any time, without notice and without liability to you or anyone else (for example, to offer or test new or different features, technologies, or services, to repair, improve or further develop the Service, to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements, or in response to exceptional or unforeseen circumstances).

Some services and features may not be available in all countries, in all languages, or in all operating systems.

2. **Privacy**
    

Please refer to the applicable privacy policy available in the App or in the relevant App Marketplace (as defined below) for information on how we process your personal data, treat your information and protect your privacy when you use the Service.

3. **Eligibility**
    

**OUR SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF 16.** If you are over the age of 16 but under the legal age of majority in your state or country of residence, your parent or guardian must review and agree to be bound by these Terms on your behalf and must supervise your use of the Service. The parent or legal guardian of a user under the legal age of majority is fully responsible for the acts or omissions of that under-age user in relation to our Service.

You may not download and use the Apps in any jurisdiction expressly prohibited by Bending Spoons. You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

4. **End User License**
    

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and your payment of the applicable subscription fees, we hereby grant you, for your personal and non-commercial purposes, a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use the Service and to download and install a copy of the applicable App provided to you by us or on our behalf on a permitted device that you own or control (a “**Device**”).

Except as expressly permitted by these Terms and the terms applicable to the mobile application store where we make the applicable App available (each, an “**App Marketplace**”), you agree that you will not: (a) rent, lease, lend, sell, distribute, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or make available the Service; (b) copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, alter, mimic, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Service, any updates, content or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open source components included with the Service); (c) violate any applicable law, contract, intellectual property right, or other third-party right or commit a tort; (d) develop or use any applications or software that interact with our Service without our prior written consent; or (e) use our Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, or engage in, encourage, or promote any activity that violates these Terms.

5. **Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes**
    

Promotions, contests, and sweepstakes that you enter on the Service or in connection with the Service (each, a “**Promotion**”) may be subject to official rules or conditions that are supplemental to these Terms, and which may provide eligibility requirements, entry instructions, deadlines, prize information and restrictions. If you wish to participate in a Promotion, please refer to the applicable official rules or conditions. If a Promotion’s official rules or conditions conflict with these Terms, the provisions contained in the official rules or conditions govern and control the relevant Promotion. Your entry into a Promotion constitutes User-Generated Content and is subject to all provisions of these Terms that govern your submission and our use of your User-Generated Content, and we may also use such User-Generated Content for advertising, marketing, and promotional purposes.

6. **Purchases, Subscriptions, Promotional Codes, and Auto Renewals**
    

We may offer free trials in our sole discretion. Upon installation or expiration of a free trial offer (if applicable), or a redeemed Virtual Item or Promotional Code, you will be charged the applicable subscription fees (if any) for your use of the Service. **Upon expiration of the initial term of your subscription, whether such subscription is weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or otherwise, your subscription will automatically renew at the then-current subscription fee for recurring subscription periods of the same duration unless and until you affirmatively cancel your subscription. If you have purchased your subscription through an App, you can cancel your subscription or automatic renewals at any time in accordance with the App-specific terms provided below and to the policies of each App Marketplace.** **If you have purchased your subscription through the Site, you can manage and cancel your subscription and any automatic renewals at any time following the instructions in your subscription purchase or renewal confirmation emails, or by following the instructions in the applicable support page of the Service.** Uninstalling an App will not result in the cancellation of your subscription. If you have begun a subscription period and you then decide to cancel your subscription during such period, you will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for such subscription period, and you will continue to be able to use the Service for which you subscribed until the end of such subscription period. **We may change the applicable subscription fees at any time at our sole discretion.** Changes to the subscription fees will not apply retroactively.

The Service may enable you to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use virtual items or in-app consumables (collectively, the “**Virtual Items**”), which could include virtual cards, tokens or other units that can be redeemed for additional features, enhancements, functionalities, content, or services within the Service. You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items through the Service and you may only redeem or use Virtual Items through the Service in which the Virtual Items are purchased. We may manage, regulate, change, or remove Virtual Items at any time at our sole discretion. **All consumable in-app purchases made through the Service and all Virtual Items (and all redemptions of Virtual Items) are final and non-refundable. You acknowledge that you will not receive any refund or compensation for unused Virtual Items when your access to the Service or your account (if any) is suspended or terminated for any reason.**

We may provide you with gift cards or promotional codes that can be redeemed for additional features, enhancements, functionalities, content, services, or Virtual Items within a specified Service and for a limited period of time, subject eligibility requirements (the “**Promotional Codes**”). Promotional Codes have no cash value, are personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and we are under no obligation to provide any compensation in connection with a Promotional Code. The Service may require that you create or log in to your account to use Promotional Codes.

The validity of these Terms and the validity of any purchase associated with the Service will be considered independently from each other, meaning that the termination of such associated purchase will not affect the validity of these Terms, and the termination of these Terms may not affect the validity of such associated purchase.

To complete your purchase, you must have a valid billing address within a country that can be selected as part of the checkout process using the Service (the “**Territory**”). We make no guarantees that any subscription, promotion, or Virtual Items will be appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory. No aspect of the Service or purchase made in connection with the Service is authorized for resale. We may place at our own discretion a limit on the quantities that may be purchased per order, per account, per payment card, per person, or per household. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to refuse service to you or reject any order at any time and refund any money you have paid for such order.

Prices shown on our Service exclude all taxes and other associated fees, which will be added (if any) to the amount of your purchase and itemized on the checkout page. You will have an opportunity to review such taxes and fees before you confirm your purchase. All prices on our Service are subject to change at any time without notice.

If you wish to make a transaction, you may be asked to supply certain relevant information, such as your payment card number and its expiration date and your billing address to us or our payment processors. You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any payment card that you submit in connection with a transaction. We may receive updated information from your issuing bank or our payment service provider about any payment method you have stored with us. You authorize us to charge your payment method, including any updated payment method information we receive, for any charges you are responsible for under these Terms. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any transaction. You will pay all charges incurred by you or on your behalf through the Service, at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred, including all taxes and associated fees applicable to your transactions. In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, you will reimburse us and our vendors or agents for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses.

We expressly disclaim any duty or obligation to undertake any monitoring or review of any User-Generated Content and, should your User-Generated Content violate these Terms, we may terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Service, take any action with respect to your User-Generated Content that is necessary or appropriate, or cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or court order with respect to the User-Generated Content.

If the Service allows you or requires you to provide registration information and create an account, these Terms also govern your account.

When you choose a username or otherwise create a nickname, you agree not to use any name that is unlawful, fraudulent, deceptive, harmful, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, offensive, threatening, hateful, violent, harassing, discriminatory or racist, or any name that infringes or violates another person’s rights (including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights, and rights of privacy and publicity).

17. **Governing Law**
    

These Terms, and any dispute, claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims), or matters arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of New York, U.S., excluding any conflict-of-laws rule or principle that might refer the governance or the construction of these Terms to the law of any other jurisdiction.

18. **Dispute Resolution; Binding Individual Arbitration**
    

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND BENDING SPOONS TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND BENDING SPOONS FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND BENDING SPOONS AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. BENDING SPOONS AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.**

**THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS IN THIS SECTION ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF ANY PARTY’S CLAIMS.**

**FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IN SECTION 18(l) IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.**

> **a) Claims Subject to this Section**. The dispute resolution and binding arbitration terms in this Section 18 apply to all Claims between you and Bending Spoons. A “**Claim**” is any dispute, claim, cause of action, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed below) between you and Bending Spoons, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory for which either party wishes to seek legal recourse and that arises from or relates to these Terms or our Service, including any related to privacy or data-security or to the formation, validity, enforceability, revocability, performance, breach, or scope of the Terms or arbitration agreement or any portion of it or arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of the Terms or arbitration agreement.
> 
> **b) Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration**. If you have a Claim against Bending Spoons or if Bending Spoons has a Claim against you, you and Bending Spoons must first attempt to resolve the Claim informally in order to try to resolve the Claim faster and reduce costs for both parties. You and Bending Spoons will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Claim for 45 days, or such longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties (“**Informal Resolution Period**”), from the day either party receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party (a “**Claimant Notice**”) in accordance with these Terms.
> 
> You will send any Claimant Notice to Bending Spoons by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet, 20154 Milan, Italy or by email to bspoperations@legalmail.it. Bending Spoons will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to Bending Spoons or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to Bending Spoons. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must (i) include the sender’s name, address, email address, telephone number, and any relevant purchase information; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought.
> 
> The Informal Resolution Period is intended to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You or Bending Spoons cannot initiate arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or Bending Spoons file a Claim in court or initiate arbitration without first providing a compliant Claimant Notice and waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court or arbitrator to enjoin the filing or arbitration and seek damages from the party that has not followed the informal dispute-resolution process to reimburse it for any costs and fees—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.
> 
> The statute of limitations and any filing-fee deadlines for a Claim shall be tolled for the duration of the Information Resolution Period for that Claim so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.
> 
> **c) Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions**. Except for individual disputes that qualify for small-claims court (provided that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar representative actions or relief) and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual-property rights of you or Bending Spoons, including any disputes in which you or Bending Spoons seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use or infringement of your or Bending Spoons’ intellectual property (“**IP Claims**”), all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 18(b) will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
> 
> **d) Binding Individual Arbitration**. Subject to the Terms of this Section, Claims may only be adjudicated by binding individual arbitration conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“**NAM**”), [https://namadr.com](https://namadr.com/), according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., (“**FAA”**) and NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Claim arose (the “**Rules”**), as modified by these Terms.
> 
> If NAM notifies the parties in writing (email suffices) that it is not available to arbitrate any Claim, then that Claim may only be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”), [https://www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). For Claims that must be arbitrated by AAA, if you are a “Consumer,” meaning that you only use the Service for personal, family, or household purposes, the then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules apply to Claims between you and Bending Spoons, as modified by these Terms. For Claims that must be arbitrated by AAA, if you are not a “Consumer,” the then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures apply to Claims between you and Bending Spoons as modified by these Terms.
> 
> These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section 18 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Claim and to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are individual to you or Bending Spoons to satisfy one of our individual Claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).
> 
> **e) Arbitration Procedure and Location**. You or Bending Spoons may initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period by filing a demand for arbitration with NAM (or with AAA if applicable pursuant to Section 18(d)).
> 
> Instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by emailing NAM at commercial@namadr.com, and instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling AAA at 800-778-7879. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to Bending Spoons by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy or by email to bspoperations@legalmail.it. Bending Spoons will send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to Bending Spoons or via reasonably available means of notice if you have not provided certified mail or email contact information to Bending Spoons.
> 
> The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the English language. You and Bending Spoons both agree that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.
> 
> For Claims in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000 or less, the arbitrator will decide the matter solely based on written submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For Claims in which the claimant seeks more than USD $10,000, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing is necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in New York, New York, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules.
> 
> The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve all Claims in arbitration. Unless you and Bending Spoons agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each Claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.
> 
> An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; they cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case except to enforce the award itself unless the parties agree prior to issuance of the award. Any arbitration decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement.
> 
> **f) Arbitration Fees.** Except for circumstances outlined in Sections 18(g) and 18(h), each party will be responsible for arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules and these Terms.
> 
> **g) Frivolous or Improper Claims.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs and fees incurred by the defending party—including arbitration, attorney, and expert fees—related to a Claim if an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was frivolous or (ii) the Claim was filed for any improper purpose, such as to harass the responding party, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution.
> 
> **h) Offers of Settlement.** Either party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer for a Claim. If an arbitration decision or award is later issued that is less favorable to a party than the latest written offer of settlement that party rejected, that party must pay all arbitration costs and fees incurred by the other party after the written settlement offer was made.
> 
> **i) One Year to Assert Claims. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY CLAIM BY YOU OR BENDING SPOONS AGAINST THE OTHER MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU OR BENDING SPOONS WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THAT CLAIM.**
> 
> **j) Confidentiality.** If you or Bending Spoons submits a Claim to arbitration, you and Bending Spoons agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and Bending Spoons agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.
> 
> **k) Coordinated Filings.** If 25 or more Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “**Coordinated Claims**” and will be treated as mass filings, mass arbitrations or multiple case filings according to the Rules (including, when applicable, AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules), if and to the extent Coordinated Claims are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Terms. You or Bending Spoons may advise the other of your or its belief that Claims are Coordinated Claims, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of “Coordinated Claims” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. The following procedures are intended to supplement the Rules, and to the extent the procedures conflict with those Rules, to supersede them.
> 
> **COORDINATED CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE FILED IN ARBITRATION AS PERMITTED BY THE BELLWETHER PROCESS SET FORTH BELOW.** **APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS WILL BE TOLLED FOR CLAIMS ASSERTED AS COORDINATED CLAIMS FROM THE TIME A COMPLIANT CLAIMANT NOTICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY A PARTY UNTIL THESE TERMS PERMIT SUCH COORDINATED CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN ARBITRATION OR COURT.**
> 
> Initial Bellwether: The bellwether process set forth in this Section will not proceed until counsel representing the Coordinated Claims has advised the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or substantially all the Claimant Notices for the Coordinated Claims have been provided.
> 
> After that point, counsel for the parties shall select 20 Coordinated Claims to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow each side to test the merits of its claims and arguments. Each side shall select 10 claimants who have provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Coordinated Claims will be delayed by this bellwether process. Any remaining Coordinated Claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those Claims, unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as set out in this Section 18(k).
> 
> A single arbitrator shall preside over each Coordinated Claim chosen for a bellwether proceeding, and only one Coordinated Claim may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.
> 
> Mediation: Once the arbitrations that are part of the bellwether process have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the other party agree), counsel for the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Claims, with the mediator’s fee paid for by Bending Spoons. Counsel for the claimants and the other party must agree on a mediator within 30 days after the conclusion of the last bellwether arbitration. If counsel for the claimants and the other party cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. All parties will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.
> 
> Remaining Claims: If the mediation does not yield a global resolution of all remaining Coordinated Claims, the arbitration requirement in this Section 18 shall no longer apply to Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party but that were not resolved in the bellwether proceedings. Such Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in accordance with Section 18.
> 
> To the extent you are asserting the same Claim as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable.
> 
> If Coordinated Claims released from the arbitration requirement are brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in Coordinated Claims for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party. Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis.
> 
> A court shall have authority to enforce the bellwether and mediation processes defined in this Section 18(k) and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.
> 
> **l) Opting Out of Arbitration**. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days from the date when these Terms first become binding on you by providing us with notice of your decision to opt out via email at bspoperations@legalmail.it or by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy. To be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. If you opt out of this updated arbitration clause and were previously subject to an arbitration clause in effect prior to this updated arbitration clause, then that prior arbitration clause shall remain as the arbitration clause between us. If you are a new user and did not previously consent to the prior arbitration clause and you choose to opt-out of this updated arbitration clause, then we will also not be bound by this updated arbitration clause.
> 
> **m) Rejection of Future Arbitration Changes.** You may reject any change we make to Section 18 (except address changes) by sending us notice of your rejection within 30 days of the change via email at bspoperations@legalmail.it or by certified mail addressed to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy. Changes to Section 18 may only be rejected as a whole, and you may not reject only certain changes to Section 18. If you reject changes made to Section 18, the most recent version of Section 18 that you have not rejected will continue to apply.
> 
> **n) Severability**. If any portion of this Section 18 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 18 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 18; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 18 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief whose primary purpose and effect is to prohibit and enjoin conduct harmful to the general public), that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 18 will be enforceable. To the extent that you prevail on a Claim and seek public injunctive relief, the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration.

19. **General**
    

Unless otherwise stated in these Terms, we may issue any notice that is required or referenced in these Terms to you by (a) email, (b) posting notice through the Service, or (c) any other legally accepted means. It is your responsibility to keep your information current to receive notifications and to check the Service regularly (for example, by opening the App once a month). Notices sent by email will be effective when we send the email to the address you provided to us; and notices we provide by posting will be effective upon posting. To give us notice under these Terms, you must contact us as follows: (1) by email to bspoperations@legalmail.it, or (2) by personal delivery, overnight courier or registered or certified mail to Via Nino Bonnet 10, 20154 Milan, Italy, Attention: Legal. Notices provided by personal delivery will be effective immediately. Notices provided to us by email or overnight courier will be effective one business day after they are sent. Notices provided to us by registered or certified mail will be effective three business days after they are sent.

You will not assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or your rights and obligations hereunder, without obtaining the prior written consent of one of our authorized representatives, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be void. We may assign these Terms or delegate our obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without your consent, to any person or entity at any time.

Any failure by us to exercise or enforce any of our rights under these Terms does not waive our right to enforce such rights. Any waiver of such rights will only be effective if it is in writing and signed by one of our authorized representatives. The rights and remedies under these Terms are cumulative and are in addition to and not in substitution for any other rights and remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise.

If any provision or part of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision, or the affected part thereof, will be deemed amended so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as narrowly as possible in order to give effect to as much of these Terms as possible. Any unaffected provision of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

These Terms will be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Except as expressly provided in Sections 8 (**Our Intellectual Property Rights**), 10 (**Third-Party Services, Materials and Advertising**), 12 (**Indemnification**), 19 (**General**), and 20 (**Additional Terms for App Marketplaces**) there are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms other than each of our affiliates.

Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of these Terms to the extent such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, epidemic, flood, act of terrorism, or any other event beyond the control of such party.

**Call Recording Feature**. Certain states or countries may have laws prohibiting the recording of calls without consent from all parties to the call. You may violate a state’s or country’s criminal law or create civil liability for yourself by listening in on or recording a telephone conversation without first informing all other parties that you are doing so. Bending Spoons may, in its discretion, add beeps, tones, or other auditory notification features to the Apps. Bending Spoons makes no warranties, express or implied, that use of such features, alone, constitute adequate notice under the laws of your state or country. By installing or using the Services, you agree (i) to comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including obtaining consent to record, where applicable); and (ii) that Bending Spoons has no liability for your failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

**Notice to Government End Users**. Any Service provided by Bending Spoons or its affiliates installed for or on behalf of the United States, its agencies and/or instrumentalities ("**United States Government**"), are provided with restricted rights as "commercial products" or “commercial services,” as those terms are defined at 48 CFR § 2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such terms are used in 48 CFR §12.212 or 48 CFR § 227.7202 et seq., as applicable. Pursuant to 48 CFR §12.212, the United States Government shall have only those rights specified in the license contained herein. The United States Government shall not be entitled to (i) technical information that is not customarily provided to the public or to (ii) use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation except as specified herein. Use, duplication, or disclosure by the United States Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in 48 CFR § 252.227-7013 or 48 CFR § 52.227-19, as applicable.

20. **Additional Terms for App Marketplaces**
    

When you access, purchase, or download an App from the Apple App Store, you acknowledge and agree that:

* These Terms are between you and Bending Spoons, and not Apple Inc. or its subsidiaries (collectively, “**Apple**”), and as between Bending Spoons and Apple, Bending Spoons is solely responsible for the App and the content thereof.
    
* You may only use the App on an Apple-branded product that you own or control and as permitted by the _Usage Rules_ set forth in the terms and guidelines that govern your use of the Apple App Store (including the _Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions_), except that the App may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with your account from which you made your purchase via Family Sharing or volume purchasing.
    
* Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
    
* In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App to you where applicable. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of Bending Spoons.
    
* Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation.
    
* In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Apple and Bending Spoons, Bending Spoons will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.
    
* You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the App or any component or product thereof except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the App was obtained. You also agree that you will not use the App or any component or product thereof for any purposes prohibited by such laws. In particular, but without limitation, the App may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List.

* Apple is a third-party beneficiary of this Section of these Terms, and Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Section of these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
    

When you access, purchase, or download the App from Google Play, you acknowledge and agree that:

* To the extent that these Terms conflict with the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement, the Google Play Terms of Service or the terms and guidelines that govern your use of Google Play (the “**Google Play Terms**”), the Google Play Terms will prevail solely with respect to your use of the Google Play site, including your downloading of Apps.
    
* Google LLC or its subsidiaries will not be responsible for and will not have any liability under these Terms.
    

21. **Additional Terms for Robokiller**
    

**General**. Robokiller offers among other things, the ability to automatically block nuisance calls (robocalls, telemarketers, etc.), forward nuisance calls to an Answer Bot selected by you or a default voicemail greeting, record and transcribe nuisance calls, blacklist and whitelist specific numbers and, if enabled, block SMS spam messages. RoboKiller also offers automated call screening assistance. When an unrecognized number calls that is not (i) a contact, (ii) on your whitelist, or (iii) not clearly identified as spam, the automated call screening assistance feature will prompt the caller to state a name and purpose for the call, all of which is recorded, transcribed, and made available for your review. Android users will actively need to enable this feature. iOS users can disable this feature in the RoboKiller’s settings. Certain features may not be available in earlier versions of the application or on Android devices.

**Functionality**. If you upgrade your operating system version, it is recommended that you disable/deprogram your Device, uninstall, and reinstall Robokiller to ensure you have the best experience. Instructions on how to disable/re-program Robokiller can be found in the settings menu of the App.

**Call Blocking/Forwarding**. Activating the call blocking/forwarding feature means that certain incoming calls (e.g., declined calls, silenced calls or unanswered calls) are forwarded to Robokiller in order to identify and block nuisance and unwanted calls accordingly (or send them back to your Device as a safe call—all before your phone rings). Calls from your Device’s contacts go directly to your Device. When you dial the number provided to you during the setup process, a message will appear to inform you that calls will not be forwarded to that number.

Please note that you are solely responsible for any charges imposed by your mobile service provider for (i) using the call forwarding feature, (ii) local or long distance usage, and (iii) text message and data usage.

**Number Monitoring**. You agree to check the numbers and messages from blocked calls on your Device regularly to ensure that you whitelist any legitimate phone number so that it will not be blocked in the future. The Service also provides you the ability to create and modify a personal whitelist ("**Allow List**") and blacklist ("**Block List**"). You can use the whitelist feature to ensure that a specific number is never blocked. You can add or remove users from your personal Allow List and Block List at any time. Please note that if you have requested a call from, or have an existing relationship with a debt relief company, collections company or if you provided your number to authorize a sales call to any company and you desire to continue receiving those calls, we advise you to add the number to your contacts or Allow List and to monitor your Robokiller messages for calls you may wish to return.

**Access to Microphone**. When you download Robokiller and begin the setup and activation process, Robokiller will ask permission to access your Device’s microphone. You must give Robokiller permission to access your Device’s microphone in order for the App to properly function. The Service uses your Device’s microphone to ensure you can talk to the caller when Robokiller initiates a VoIP call with a safe caller.

**Access to Contacts**. In order to provide the Service, Robokiller must access the numbers in your Device’s address book.

**Answer Bots**. Robokiller provides you the option to use its Answer Bots to respond to unwanted spam and robocallers. Answer Bots are pre-recorded audio messages. You can choose whichever Answer Bot you like or make your own audio content and recordings (“**Audio(s)**”). If you choose not to use Answer Bots, unwanted spam and robocallers will hear a very polite but concise default recording. When unwanted spam and robocallers engage with one of Robokiller’s Answer Bots, the conversation is recorded as a voicemail and saved within the App (“**Answer Bot Recording**”). By using Robokiller’s Answer Bot feature, you expressly authorize us to record Answer Bot conversations on your behalf.

Robokiller provides users the ability to share Audios and Answer Bot Recordings. For every Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording you decide to share, you represent and warrant that:

* you will share Audio and/or Answer Bot Recordings strictly from unsolicited, unwanted spam and robocallers and you will not share any Audio and/or Answer Bot Recordings from people with whom you have an established relationship with (e.g., signing up to receive offers);
    
* to the extent there is an identifiable person mentioned in your Audio and/or the Answer Bot Recording, you have obtained the appropriate rights, permissions and/or licenses from such person in order to share the Answer Bot Recording;
    
* Bending Spoons will not need to obtain any rights, permissions and/or licenses from any third party or pay royalties to any third party in order to make the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording publicly available;
    
* the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording do not infringe any third party’s rights, including intellectual property rights and privacy rights; and
    
* the Audio and/or Answer Bot Recording comply with these Terms, all applicable laws as well as the terms of use of any social media platform or application.
    

Users may also share their own unique Answer Bot Audio creations with Robokiller either directly within the App or via email. As between you and Bending Spoons, you own the Audios that you create and submit to Robokiller. By submitting your Audios, you grant Bending Spoons and its affiliates, a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right to access, use, copy, transmit, reproduce, distribute, publicly perform and display (through all media now known or hereinafter created) and make derivative works from your Audios for the purpose of: (i) making the Audios available for review by Bending Spoons; (ii) providing the Audios on social media and other platforms; (iii) allowing other Robokiller Users to play, download and use your Audios within the App; (iv) promoting Robokiller’s Answer Bots, provided you have made your Audios publicly available; and (v) archiving or preserving the Audios for disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations. You further grant all Robokiller Users the ability to view your Audios for personal, non-commercial purposes. This includes the right to copy and make derivative works from the Audios solely to the extent necessary to view the Audios. The aforementioned licenses will continue unless and until you remove your Audios from the App, in which case the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely.

For every Audio you create and upload, post or transmit to Robokiller, you represent and warrant that:

* you have the right to submit the Audios to Robokiller and grant the licenses set forth herein;
    
* your Audio is civil and respectful;
    
* your Audio does not contain any sexually explicit content or pornography;
    
* the Audio does not contain hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incites hatred against any individual or group;
    
* your Audio does not harm or exploit minors;
    
* your Audio does not discuss unlawful acts or extreme violence; and
    
* the Audio does not promote fraudulent or dubious business schemes.
    

**Voicemail and Call Screening Transcriptions**. Your version of Robokiller may include transcription capabilities. Should you decide to deploy the transcription features, you acknowledge and expressly agree that Bending Spoons may transcribe or have transcribed by a third party and store or have stored by a third party, voicemail messages and call screening recording, and to make such transcriptions available to you.

**Call Recordings**. Your version of the App may include call recording capabilities. If so, by using the App, you acknowledge and expressly agree that (i) you are the sole party responsible for initiating a call recording, and (ii) you have provided appropriate notice or obtained appropriate consents, as necessary under the laws of your state or country, to record all parties to the call.

**Call Data Retention**. Your personal data will be retained according to the retention periods outlined in the App’s Privacy Policy. We make no guarantees that we will retain certain call data such as calls, call recordings, voicemail, call screens, Answer Bots and transcriptions for greater than six months, after which we may delete any such call data. If you would like to retain this information, you can go to the App’s call details and share the information to your email or cloud storage account. You acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for the back-up of this information. If you delete your account, your calls, call recordings, voicemail, call screens, Answer Bots and transcriptions will be deleted from our servers and no longer accessible. If you delete a recording, it will be deleted from our servers and no longer accessible. If you want to retain recordings or other call data for longer, you should go to call details and share information with your email or cloud storage account. You acknowledge and agree that you bear sole responsibility for the back-up of this information.

**SMS Spam Protection**. Robokiller provides you with the option to enable a SMS spam protection feature which will filter SMS and MMS messages from individuals not in your Device’s contacts. When you enable the SMS spam blocking feature and grant us permission, we will filter SMS text messages from individuals that are not in your Device’s contacts and attempt to block any spam messages.

**Personal Data Protection.** Robokiller provides you with the option to purchase a personal data protection feature within the App. If purchased, the personal data protection service will regularly use your information to scan online data broker websites (“**Data Sites**”) for personal information about you. Sometimes these Data Sites are called people search sites. If online personal information about you is identified at these Data Sites, Bending Spoons or its designated third party partner will submit opt-out requests on your behalf to remove such personal information (“**Opt-Out**”). You can go to the App at any time to see if online personal information about you was found on these Data Sites and whether the Opt-Out was successful. Bending Spoons may change the Data Sites that are being scanned at any time without notice to you. In order to submit an Opt-Out request to remove your personal information from Data Sites, Bending Spoons, or its designated third party partner, may need to interact with Data Sites on your behalf. Solely in connection with and for the purpose of providing the personal data protection service, you expressly authorize Bending Spoons, its agents, service providers, and its employees, to act as your personal representative in order to submit Opt-Out requests to Data Sites and:

* obtain information on your behalf;
    
* submit your personal information to the Data Sites;
    
* communicate with the Data Sites or other third parties on your behalf;
    
* agree to applicable terms and conditions imposed by these Data Sites;
    
* complete and sign or execute documents on your behalf necessary to assist in fulfilling your opt-out request; and
    
* take other actions that Bending Spoons may believe are reasonably necessary to complete an Opt-Out request from a Data Site or to implement the personal data protection feature.

**Call Blocking Feature**. In order to take advantage of TrapCall's call blocking feature, you may be asked to enable call forwarding/blocking features on your Device during the installation and App setup process. Activating the call forwarding/blocking features means that certain incoming calls (e.g., declined calls, silenced calls or unanswered calls) are forwarded to TrapCall in order to identify and block nuisance and unwanted calls accordingly (or send them back to your Device as a safe call—all before your phone rings). Calls from your Device’s contacts go directly to your Device. When you dial the number provided to you during the setup process, a message will appear to inform you that calls will not be forwarded to that number. Please note that you are solely responsible for any charges imposed by your mobile service provider for (i) using the call forwarding feature, (ii) local or long distance usage, and (iii) text message and data usage.

If you want to retain this information longer, you should go to the App’s call details and share the information to your email or cloud storage account. You acknowledge that you bear sole responsibility for the back-up of this information. If you delete your account, your calls, call recordings, voicemail, call screens, Answer Bots and transcriptions will be deleted from our servers and no longer accessible.

The rights and remedies under these Terms are cumulative and are in addition to and not in substitution for any other rights and remedies available at law.

If any provision or part of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision, or the affected part thereof, will be deemed amended in order to achieve as closely as possible the same effect as originally drafted. Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as narrowly as possible in order to give effect to as much of these Terms as possible. Any unaffected provision of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

These Terms will be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
