### 4.1 Available Service Plans

The Kahoot! services are available under different Service Plans. Our Websites provide details of the available Service Plans, which can be categorized as one of the following:

1. **Free Service Plans:**Our free Service Plans offer access to a limited set of features in the Kahoot! Services. The free Service Plans can be used for non-commercial purposes only.
2. **Paid Service Plans**: Our paid Service Plans give access to more features and functionality. The Paid Service Plans are permitted for use in professional and commercial settings, such as training, surveys and events, both for internal and external audiences. The features and functionalities available depend on the plan type. Each plan has limitations on the number of licenses and participants.

The Service Plans vary based on the Kahoot! Service you have chosen to subscribe to, and the content and features of a Service Plan may vary based on when you signed up and whether you have signed up through our Website or via the App. Details about the different Service Plans are available on our website.

You can manage your Service Plans from your Kahoot! user account. If you have purchased a Paid Service Plan through a distribution platform such as Google Play or Apple App Store, you must manage your account through such platforms.

### 4.2 Content Subscriptions

In addition to your chosen Service Plan, you may purchase certain Content Subscriptions from the Kahoot! Platform, such as the Kahoot!+ AccessPass or subscriptions to Verified Creator channels.

A Content Subscription gives you access to a library of content that is curated at Kahoot!’s sole discretion.  
You acknowledge that the content available through each Content Subscription is subject to change at Kahoot!’s sole discretion, including without limitation the removal and addition of content or change of existing content.

You agree to only use the content available through Content Subscriptions in accordance with all terms and conditions applicable to Kahoot!

5\. Payments, cancellations, upgrades
-------------------------------------

### 5.1 General

Paid Service Plans and Content Subscriptions can be purchased directly from Kahoot! in the App or on our Website, through third parties or through an Enterprise Agreement with Kahoot!. This section of the Terms only applies where you have signed up for one of our paid Service Plans or Content Subscriptions directly from us through our App or website.

You promise that your registration information, payment details (if you have signed up for a paid Service Plan subscription) and any other information that you submit to us are true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times. If you have provided incorrect or inaccurate information, you should return to the log-in screen or correct such information in your account settings. You promise that no other person shall be allowed to use or access your account, or in any other way make use of the rights conferred to you pursuant to the Agreement.

### 5.2 Payments and Subscription Periods

All Paid Service Plans and Content Subscriptions are payable in advance of each Subscription Period, non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in an Enterprise Agreement or to the extent permitted by applicable law, non-refundable.

You will be charged prior to being granted access to your Paid Service Plan or Content Subscriptions. At the end of your current Subscription Period, your Paid Service Plan and/or Content Subscriptions will automatically renew and you will be charged for the next Subscription Period in accordance with your registered payment information.

If you don’t pay for your Paid Service Plan on time, Kahoot! reserve the right to suspend your account or remove Paid Service Plan features.

### 5.3 Right to Withdraw

If you are a Consumer you may cancel your Service Plans within 14 days from the day you subscribed, depending on your jurisdiction.

If you want to use your right to withdrawal, send your cancellation to us within the 14 day period. If the 14 day period ends on a Saturday, Sunday or any public holiday, the period is extended to the next working day.

If your cancellation is made within the 14 day period, the cancellation is timely. The burden of proof for making a timely cancellation rests with you. You should therefore cancel in writing. You can use our [support request form](https://support.kahoot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to cancel your subscription.

You may test the Services to determine the nature, characteristics, or functions of the Services before using your withdrawal right. We cannot charge you for using your right to withdrawal, and we will refund you all payments made to Kahoot! for the Services, without undue delay.

**Exception for Content Subscriptions**  
However, if you are a Consumer purchasing Content Subscriptions or other content, you will lose your right to withdraw and receive a refund since you gain access to the content immediately. You will be asked through the purchase process to consent to the delivery of the Services starting immediately, and to acknowledge that the right of withdrawal therefore does not apply.

### 5.4 Cancellations

If you do not wish to renew your Subscription Period for a Paid Service Plan or Content Subscriptions, you are entitled to cancel your Paid Service Plan and/or Content Subscriptions before the end of your current Subscription Period. If you are a consumer in Norway, we will notify you of your right to cancellation every sixth month during your Subscription Period, either by email to your registered email account, in-App or in-Service notifications. You can cancel by notifying customer service [here](https://support.kahoot.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Any cancellation will become effective on the first day after the last day of your current Subscription Period. Upon cancellation, your access to features that are exclusive to the Paid Service Plans or Content Subscriptions will cease, and your subscription will be automatically downgraded to a Free Service Plan for the Kahoot! Service you subscribe to (if available).

### 5.5 Upgrades and downgrades

You may at any time upgrade or downgrade your Paid Service Plan subscription to a different Paid Service Plan. If you downgrade your subscription to a lower tier Service Plan, the downgrade will take effect on the day after the last day of the current Subscription Period. If you upgrade your subscription to a higher tier Service Plan, the upgrade will take effect immediately subject to payment of the applicable upgrade fee.

Upon upgrading, your Paid Service Plan will be subject to the new subscription term. You will be credited for any remaining term under your previous Paid Service Plan.

### 5.6 Price changes and new Service Plans

Kahoot! may change the price for a Paid Service Plan and/or Content Subscription.  If such price change applies to you, it will not be effective until the beginning of your next Subscription Period. Your continued use of the Kahoot! Services constitute your acceptance of the price change. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your subscription prior to your next Subscription Period renewal.

If you are a Consumer in Norway Kahoot! will notify you of a price change within reasonable time before it becomes effective, either by email to your registered email account, or by in-App or in-Service notifications. If the price change exceeds the annual change of the consumer price index in Norway, you may terminate the Agreement with effect from when the price change starts to run.

We do not provide any refunds if the price for a Paid Service Plan or Content Subscription drops, or if we offer subsequent promotional pricing or change the content or features of a Service Plan.

Kahoot! may decide to change or replace our Service Plans. If the Service Plan you have subscribed for is changed or replaced, your subscription will automatically be for the Service Plan that corresponds with the pricing of your original plan unless you chose to upgrade your subscription.

### 5.7 Trials

We may, at our own sole discretion, offer you a Trial. We reserve the right to revoke the Trial and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible. Separate terms and conditions, including restrictions on available features or areas of use, may apply when using a Kahoot! Service under a Trial.

For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. In such cases, your Trial will automatically be converted to a paid subscription for the selected Service Plan and/or Content Subscription as of the first day after the end of your Trial period. We will use the payment details you provided when you started the Trial to charge you. If you do not want to continue using your selected Service Plan on a paid subscription basis, or a Content Subscription, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the Trial period.

### 5.8 Pre-paid subscription Codes

If you have received a Code, separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.
