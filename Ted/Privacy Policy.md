We use various technologies, such as Sailthru, Mixpanel and Google Analytics cookies, to help manage TED offerings, track the use of the content we provide, understand how our audiences are using our TED offerings, and to better personalize them. Another tool used in conjunction with cookies relates to the use of pixels, which are used on specific landing pages on TED.com to identify our users to help advertise on third party sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn to help grow our community.

TED also uses Sailthru to help us understand preferences with respect to TED courses, podcasts, blog articles, TED talks, and other available content to determine what is most relevant to users based on their prior behavior, both individually and collectively, to help gauge which content is most relevant while accessing TED content on TED.com, the TED app, or retrieving via email or other channels.

##### Behavioral Advertising

In order to help TED better market on third party platforms, TED works with third parties to collect information about your use of our website so that TED can provide advertising about TED’s offerings (such as products and services) tailored to your interests, including free educational resources and content recommendations. That advertising may appear either on our website, on our apps, or on other websites.
