Personal Use (Non-Commercial)
-----------------------------

**Personal Use only (non-commercial):**  
We encourage you to share TED Talks, under our Creative Commons license, or ( CC BY–NC–ND 4.0 International, which means it may be shared under the conditions below:

* **CC:** means the type of license rights associated with TED Talks, or Creative Commons
* **BY:** means the requirement to include an attribution to TED as the owner of the TED Talk and include a link to the talk, but do not include any other TED branding on your website or platform, or language that may imply an endorsement.
* **NC:** means you cannot use TED Talks in any commercial context or to gain any type of revenue, payment or fee from the license sublicense, access or usage of TED Talks in an app of any kind for any advertising, or in exchange for payment of any kind, including in any ad supported content or format.
* **ND:** means that no derivative works are permitted so you cannot edit, remix, create, modify or alter the form of the TED Talks in any way. This includes using the TED Talks as the basis for another work, including dubbing, voice-overs, or other translations not authorized by TED. You may not add any more restrictions that we have placed on the TED site content, such as additional legal or technological restrictions on accessing the content.

**Embedding TED Talks on your blog or site:**

* **Type of site/company:** Bloggers, news/information websites and nonprofits (by which we mean registered 501(c)3 organizations in the United States, and the equivalent in all other countries), may share one or more TED Talks under a Creative Commons license, provided that they follow the rest of the guidelines on this page, and sharing the TED Talks is not the central purpose of your site. This means that we expect the usage under Creative Commons to be for the purpose of sharing ideas, not to use TED Talks as the main content for your site, which generates revenue or other sources of income (including from ads) that relies on content we are providing. If you are interested in licensing TED Talks for other purposes, or for general usage, please contact us for more details.
* **Transcripts and subtitles** may be used under the same Creative Commons license in conjunction with the TED Talk video. Copyright on the transcripts is owned by TED and any edits, alternate usage rights or changes to these documents are not permitted without permission. Therefore, if you wanted to publish a TED Talk in a book, test, play, or any other publication, permission is required.
* **Video player:** You must use the TED embeddable player. This allows us to further our overall mission by tracking video usage. Scraping video from TED.com is not permitted.
* **Attribution:** You must attribute TED as the owner of the TED Talk and add a visible link back to TED.com
* **Running talks in their entirety:** You may not edit TED Talks, or alter them in any way, including by sharing truncated versions or clips. This is essential for preserving the integrity of the speaker's ideas.
* **Lists on blogs and articles:** If you are posting a blog or article that contains curations of TED Talks that can be easily integrated by an organization into its learning program (e.g. talks relating to leadership, DEI, wellness, etc.), which constitutes commercial use, please include the following attribution and link to TED@Work: For more information on these topics and how TED can be used for corporate learning, please visit [https://tedatwork.ted.com](https://tedatwork.ted.com/?utm_source=ted_com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=usage_policy)/

Commercial / Corporate Use
--------------------------

Using a TED Talk in a commercial context requires a license. This type of use is not limited to uses that generate profit, but includes employee learning, on an intranet system, at a company event, in training materials, within a TED-branded video offering or editorial program, in tv/film including documentaries, in an online or virtual course, in a podcast, and more. Non-profit or educational institutions may also require licenses if the use is commercial in nature.

To license TED Talks for use within your organization, we’ve created a new program called [TED@Work](https://tedatwork.ted.com/?utm_source=ted_com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=usage_policy). This program is designed for organizations interested in using TED Talks for initiatives including Learning and Development, Leadership, or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I). [Learn more about TED@Work here](https://tedatwork.ted.com/?utm_source=ted_com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=usage_policy) - you can make inquiries through a form on that page.

A TED@Work license enables:

* access to an exclusive library of TED@Work learning content and tools that make TED Talks actionable learning experiences;
* curation and metadata created for organizational use, that doesn't exist on ted.com or YouTube; and
* distribution of TED Talks for other uses within your organization.

Companies and organizations considering embedding or hyperlinking TED content in other contexts; such as internal communications, company websites and one-off licenses must [inquire here](https://media-requests.ted.com/). Please note that no promotional applications of TED content are permitted. Licenses for commercial applications involve a fee, which supports TED’s nonprofit mission of Ideas Worth Spreading.

If you are a for-profit company seeking to: create a TED-branded video offering, television series or film (including documentaries), podcast, online or virtual course, original editorial program or other service offering -- please check if your company’s business aligns with one or more of the categories listed below, as a formal distribution partnership with TED is required. To submit an inquiry, please fill out our [media licensing request form](https://media-requests.ted.com/).

* Internet Video Service
* Audio Service (including podcasts)
* Specialized Cable/Satellite Channel
* Home Entertainment Device
* IPTV Service and Set Top Box Manufacturer
* Mobile and Tablet Manufacturer
* Web Browser Applications and Stores
* Subscription-Based Educational Service (Online Education Company)

Projecting TED Talks to a group
-------------------------------

We encourage you to find creative ways to share TED Talks with your friends, family, students, colleagues and communities. See below for specific examples. Please note that some of the below use cases require a license.

**TED Talks in the classroom**  
Many educators use TED Talks to stimulate discussions with students or to complement course materials and we encourage you to do so as well. You can stream TED Talks from TED.com or from TED’s official YouTube channel, as long as you comply with the terms of the Creative Commons license outlined above. Feel free to share links to TED.com or TED’s official YouTube channel with students on online forums or class websites.

**TED-Ed videos**  
On YouTube.com/TEDEducation are made available under YouTube's standard policy, not Creative Commons. For more information about licensing TED-Ed videos, please fill out our [media licensing request form](https://media-requests.ted.com/).

**TED Talks at non-TED conferences**  
Conference presenters can stream TED Talks from TED.com or TED’s official YouTube channel in a non-commercial, educational context. Commercial entities require a license to show TED Talks at a conference or industry event and should fill out our [media licensing request form](https://media-requests.ted.com/). Presenters using TED in a non-commercial context can stream TED Talks from TED.com or TED’s official YouTube channel, as long as you comply with the terms of the Creative Commons license outlined above. In particular, the talks must be shown unedited, including the TED visuals and if applicable those of the partner conference or TEDx event, and those of the TED Talks sponsor, as well as the copyright information. For more information about using TED Talks in a commercial context at conferences or industry events, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ted.com).

If you’re interested in organizing a TED-like event in your own community, please learn more about how to do so through our [TEDx initiative](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program).

**Screening to groups**

Media requests FAQ
------------------

**How long will it take to hear back regarding my media request?**  
We ask for a minimum of two weeks to review and process all media requests. As an organization dedicated to spreading worthy ideas, processing can take longer due to our [conference schedule](https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences) or [company holidays](https://blog.ted.com/why-ted-takes-two-weeks-off-every-summer/). Please know that we are working as quickly and as diligently as possible, however, to address your request!

**I have a great person in mind to be a TED speaker. How can I share this with TED?**  
If you would like to nominate a speaker for a TED Talk, [please go here](https://www.ted.com/participate/nominate).

**How can I bring TED into the classroom for English language learning?**  
TED is currently partnered with National Geographic Learning to license our content directly to schools for ELL. You can learn more about this initiative [here](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/national-geographic-learning-with-ted). For additional questions, please submit a [media request](https://media-requests.ted.com/).

**Can I use TED content in my song or music?**  
It is important for TED that the integrity of the speaker's idea is protected and that the talk is not edited or used in a context not intended. With that in mind, we cannot permit using TED content in this way.

**Where do I direct press related inquiries for TED content?**  
For press information, images and media resources about TED conferences, TED.com and TED Talks, please use our [contact form](https://help.ted.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (select "Press Inquiry" from the topic dropdown) with a relevant subject line.

**Can I translate TED content for my YouTube channel?**  
We do not permit individuals and/or organizations to translate or dub outside of the official TED Translator community, as modifying the content in this way is not covered under TED's Creative Commons license. Please also note TED and TED-Ed have official channels on YouTube, and our distribution policy does not permit re-uploading TED content onto other YouTube channels. If you are interested in making ideas more accessible to your community, join our [TED Translator community](https://www.ted.com/participate/translate/our-translators)!
