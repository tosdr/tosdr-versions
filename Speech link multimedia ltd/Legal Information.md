Speech & Language Link
----------------------

We help schools to support children with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). We do this by providing evidence based interventions, standardised screening assessments and training in the use of these tools. Everything we offer is designed by our speech and language therapy team and backed up by our specialist help desk.  
We work with individual schools, MATs, Local Authorities and NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams

**![Teddy holding a help sign](/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Teddy-with-help-sign-3.jpg)We are currently undertaking a [nationwide research project](https://speechandlanguage.info/working-with-you/research-opportunities-for-schools/infant-language-link-study/) to standardise a measure of language on school entry. Would your school like to take part? (You can get Infant Language Link free for a year!)**
