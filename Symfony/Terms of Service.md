Symfony strongly encourages visitors to regularly review the TOS and the [privacy policy](https://connect.symfony.com/privacy-policy).

I. Description of the services offered by the site
--------------------------------------------------

### 1\. Presentation of the Site

The Site is an online platform which offers services from Symfony (the “Services”).

Symfony provides its users ("Users") the Site for non-commercial, personal use. To use the Site, Users must open an account (the “Account”).

The use of the Services is free (except for the cost of connecting to the internet) and requires a terminal.

### 2\. Joining the community by creating and managing an Account

By creating an Account, Users can join the Symfony community and :

* Edit their profile, which may contains their personal data (picture, birthday, company, job position, city, country and biography) in the “real-life” and online (link to their GitHub®, Twitter®, blog URL, blogsite, etc.);
* Edit and administrate their Account;
* View their profile accessible to the other Users (the “Public Profile”) and which contains their content;
* Manage and publish their content;
* Consult their notifications from Symfony;
* Collect badges (“Badges”) and redeem a badge code to get a new one;
* Cancel their Account;
* Purchase tickets for Symfony® conferences;
* Subscribe to SymfonyInsight®, an automated code quality analysis service.

The Site enables Users to create and share content ("Users Content" or “Their Content”).

Each User can also personalize a page accessible to the other Users and associated with a specific URL (the "Public Page"). The others Users may see the User’ biography, the city where he/she leaves, the name of his/her company, the date of creation of the Account, the Badges and the link to other websites.

### 3\. Research on the Site

Users can use the search engine on the Site and access the Public Profiles of the other Users pages.

II. Accessing the services
--------------------------

To access and use the Services, Users must be legally capable of entering into a binding agreement and abide by all applicable statutes (French and/or foreign).

Users also acknowledge that the activity of creating and sharing their Content may give rise to various types of legal liabilities and Users represent that their Content complies at all times with the TOS and all applicable laws.

Users understand that Symfony does not exercise any control over and does not pre-screen Their Content and may not be held liable for their communication to the public.

III. Creation of the account
----------------------------

To Use the Services, Users will need to create an Account by providing:

* their name;
* their country;
* a username;
* a valid email address;
* a password of their choice.

The provided email address must remain valid as long as the associated Account remains active and it is the User’s responsibility to update it should it no longer be accurate or current.

Users password is strictly personal and confidential and Users shall not share it with any third-party.

Users should immediately contact Symfony if they have reason to believe that their password is being used by an unauthorized third party. Users shall be liable for all actions taken with their password as well as for any loss or liability consequential to such use. Symfony may cancel the Account of any User without notice in the case of any violation of the TOS.

* To respect the privacy of others, including that of the other Users, and the confidentiality of the information they may receive and not to post, email or otherwise transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials or any other form of solicitation;
