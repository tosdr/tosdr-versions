OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU
---------------------

1.3          **Our contract.** These terms and conditions (**Terms**) apply to the order by you and supply of goods by us to you (**Contract**). No other terms are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.

1.4          **Entire agreement.** The Contract is the entire agreement between us in relation to its subject matter. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise or representation or assurance or warranty that is not set out in the Contract.

1.5          **Language.** These Terms and the Contract are made only in the English language.

PLACING AN ORDER AND ITS ACCEPTANCE
-----------------------------------

**2.1          Placing your order.** Please follow the onscreen prompts to place an order. Each order is an offer by you to buy the goods specified in the order (**Goods**) subject to these Terms.

**2.2          Correcting input errors.** Our order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us. Please check the order carefully before confirming it. You are responsible for ensuring that your order is complete and accurate.

**2.3          Acknowledging receipt of your order.** After you place an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received it, but please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Our acceptance of your order will take place as described in clause 2.4.

**2.4          Accepting your order.** Our acceptance of your order takes place when we send the email to you to accept it, at which point the Contract between you and us will come into existence.

**2.5          If we cannot accept your order.** If we are unable to supply you with the Goods for any reason, we will inform you of this by email and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Goods, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as possible.

OUR GOODS
---------

3.1          The images of the Goods on our site are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer’s display of the colours accurately reflect the colour of the Goods. The colour of your Goods may vary slightly from those images.

3.2          The packaging of your Goods may vary from that shown on images on our site.

3.3          We reserve the right to amend the specification of the Goods if required by any applicable statutory or regulatory requirement.

RETURN AND REFUND
-----------------

4.1          You may cancel the Contract and receive a refund, if you notify us as set out in clause 4.3 within 14 days of the creation of the Contract (i.e. the date the order was placed).

4.2          However, this cancellation right does not apply in the case of any Goods which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery.

4.3          To cancel the Contract, please email us at info@paladone.com or contact our Customer Services team by telephone on +44 (0)1273 230037 or by post to Apex House, Dolphin Way, Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, United Kingdom, BN43 6NZ.

If you send us your cancellation notice by email or by post, then your cancellation is effective from the date you send us the email or post the letter to us.

4.4          If you have returned the Goods to us under this clause 4 because they are faulty or mis-described, we will refund the price of the Goods and will refund you on the credit card or debit card used by you to pay.

4.5          If Goods have been delivered to you before you decide to cancel the Contract then you must return them to us without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days after the day on which you let us know that you wish to cancel the Contract. Please email us for details of our returns address and how to arrange a return.

4.6         Orders cancelled more than 14 days after the creation of the Contract are subject to a cancellation charge of 5% of the original order (capped at £50).

DELIVERY, TRANSFER OF RISK AND TITLE
------------------------------------

5.1          Delivery is complete once the Goods have been unloaded at the address for delivery set out in your order and the Goods will be at your risk from that time.

5.2          You own the Goods once we have received payment in full, including of all applicable delivery charges.

5.3          If we fail to deliver the Goods, our liability is limited to the cost of obtaining replacement goods of a similar description and quality in the cheapest market available, less the price of the Goods. However, we will not be liable to the extent that any failure to deliver was caused by an Event Outside Our Control, or because you failed to provide adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of goods.

5.4          If you fail to take delivery within 10 days after the day on which we notified you that the Goods were ready for delivery, we may resell part of, or all the Goods.

NO INTERNATIONAL DELIVERY
-------------------------

PRICE OF GOODS AND DELIVERY CHARGES.
------------------------------------

8.1          The prices of the Goods will be as quoted on our site at the time you submit your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Goods are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system. However, please see clause 8.5**.** for what happens if we discover an error in the price of Goods you ordered.

8.2          Prices for our Goods may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order you have already placed.

8.3          The price of Goods excludes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate chargeable in the UK for the time being. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Goods in full before the change in VAT takes effect.

8.4          The price of the Goods does not include delivery charges. Our delivery charges are as advised to you during the check-out process, before you confirm your order. To check relevant delivery charges, please refer to our Delivery Charges

8.5          We sell a large number of Goods through our site. It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Goods on our site may be incorrectly priced. If we discover an error in the price of the Goods you have ordered, we will contact you via the contact details you provided when ordering to inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Goods at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. If we mistakenly accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may cancel supply of the Goods and refund you any sums you have paid.

HOW TO PAY

9.1          You can only pay for Goods using a debit card, credit card or PayPal, unless you have been offered a credit account.
