---------

The length of time we retain particular categories of personal information is determined based on whether it is sufficient to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including to satisfy legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements, establish or defend legal claims, enforce our agreements, resolve disputes or fraud prevention. We may either delete or anonymize personal information we no longer require.

Your Choices
------------

**Your privacy rights.** You can make certain requests regarding your personal information as described in the section below entitled “[Your Privacy Rights](#privacy__your-privacy-rights).”

**Opt-out of marketing emails.** You may opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. You may continue to receive Services-related and other non-marketing emails.

**Text message alerts.** We may offer text news alerts for your phone or wireless device via short message service (“SMS”) or similar technology. You must register with us to receive this service, which may require providing us your name, telephone number, and other personal information. You can cancel or modify your alerts by accessing your account through the Services or by texting “STOP” to the number associated with the text news alert. Message and data rates may apply for this service.

**Advertising choices.** You can limit use of your information for targeted advertising by:

* Browser settings. Blocking third party cookies in your browser settings.
* Ad industry tools. Opting out of targeted ads from companies participating in the following industry opt-out programs:
    * Network Advertising Initiative: [https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)
    * Digital Advertising Alliance: [optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/).
    * AppChoices mobile app, available at [https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices](https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices), which will allow you to opt-out of interest-based ads in mobile apps served by participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance.

You will need to apply these opt-out settings on each device and in each browser from which you wish to opt-out.

We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals except where we expressly indicate otherwise. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [https://www.allaboutdnt.com](https://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

**Cookies.** Most browsers let you remove and/or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, our Services may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**Declining to provide information.** We need to collect personal information to provide certain Services. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide those Services.

Other Sites and Services
------------------------

The Services may contain links to other websites and online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or other online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions.

We also make our third-party partners’ content, products or services available through our Services, whereby our partners’ brands appear on the Services in connection with such content, products or services. We may share with our partners information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our partner. In some cases, the partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our partner applies to the partner’s use of your information. For example, we make our audiocasts available through a third-party host. When you register for an audiocast, the host will collect information from you directly and will share it with us. The host will provide its privacy policy at the point of registration.

The privacy policy of our partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our partners, you should contact the partner directly for more information.

Security
--------

The security of your personal information is important to us. We employ organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

International Data Transfers
----------------------------

Our Services are intended to be used only by residents of the United States.

We are headquartered in the United States, and your personal information may be transferred to the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, or country where privacy laws may not be as protective.

Children
--------

Our services are not intended for children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 16. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a user under the age of 16 as part of the Services, we will delete such information from our records.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the applicable Service(s). Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Services after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.

Your Privacy Rights
-------------------

Residents of certain states have the rights described below under state privacy laws. However, we honor requests described in this section from all users of our digital properties who reside in the United States, regardless of your state of residence.

For purposes of this section, “personal information” has the meaning given to “personal data”, “personal information” or similar terms under the applicable privacy laws of the state in which you reside.

**Verification of Identity; Authorized Agents.** We may need to verify your identity to process your information, access, deletion, and correction requests, and we reserve the right to confirm your residency. To verify your identity, we may require authentication into your account on the Services, government identification, a declaration under penalty of perjury or other information, where permitted by law. Furthermore, your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agent’s identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable state law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you and/or your agent to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as information required to verify your identity and that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

The rights described above are subject to exemptions and, in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it. You can ask to appeal any denial of your request in the same manner through which you may submit a request.
