The Site also may include e-commerce functionality that is operated by our third-party vendor that allows you to purchase products and services directly from the Site.

We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding a vendor, its online store, its privacy policies, and/or any additional terms and conditions that may apply, visit that vendor's website and click on its information links or contact the vendor directly.

You agree to be financially responsible for all purchases made by you or someone acting on your behalf through the Site. You agree to use the Site, and to purchase services or products through the Site, for legitimate, non-commercial purposes only.

---------------

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and each of our and their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, agents, representatives and licensors, from and against any and all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that arise out of your use of the Site (including any materials you submit for display via the Site), violation of these Terms of Service by you or any other person using your account, violation of applicable laws or regulations, or your violation of any rights of another. We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this section. In such event, you agree to provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us.

Suspension and Termination of Access
------------------------------------

You agree that, in our sole discretion, we may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Site, or any part of the Site, and remove and discard any materials that you submit to the Site, at any time, for any reason, without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third-party for any suspension or termination of your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Site, or any removal of any materials that you have submitted to the Site. In the event that we suspend or terminate your access to and/or use of the Site, you will continue to be bound by the Terms of Service that were in effect as of the date of your suspension or termination.

App Stores
----------

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the mobile app is dependent on the third party from whom you received the mobile app license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play ("App Store"). You acknowledge that the Terms of Service are between you and TEGNA and not with the App Store. TEGNA, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Site, including the mobile app, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the mobile app, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Site, including the mobile app. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the mobile app is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store's terms and policies) when using the Site, including the mobile app. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms of Service and will have the right to enforce them.

Territorial Applicability
-------------------------

The Site is intended for use only by residents of the United States over the age of 13. Other countries may have laws and regulatory requirements that differ from those of the United States, and our privacy practices as described in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.king5.com/privacy) may not strictly comply with the privacy laws of such other countries. By using this Site, you agree that we will transfer any personal information that we obtain in connection with the operation of the Site to the United States.

Other
-----

This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter contained in this agreement and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals and communications, written or oral. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use the products or services of a third party that are provided through the Site. In the event of any conflict between any such third-party terms and conditions and these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will govern.

This Agreement is entered into in the State of New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of its choice of law rules. Each party to this Agreement hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the County of New York in the State of New York, and waives any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. In any action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

These Terms of Service are not intended to benefit any third party, and do not create any third-party beneficiaries. Accordingly, these Terms of Service may only be invoked or enforced by you or us. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Service must be filed by you within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
