### Responsibility for User-Provided Content.

The Site may include features that enable you to provide feedback to us and that allow users to interact with each other on the Site and post content and materials for display on the Site. By accessing and using any such features, you represent and agree: (i) that you are the owner of any material you post or submit, or are making your posting or submission with the express consent of the owner of the material; (iii) that you are making your posting or submission with the express consent of anyone pictured in any material you post or submit, (iv) that you are 13 years of age or older; (v) that the materials will not violate the rights of, or cause injury to, any person or entity; and (vi) that you will indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and each of our and their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, agents, representatives and licensors, from and against any liability of any nature arising out of related to any content or materials displayed on or submitted via the Site by you or by others using your username and password. You also grant us a license to use the materials you post or submit via such features, as described above under the header "Rights and Restrictions Relating to Site Content."

You will not use the Site to collect, upload, transmit, display, or distribute any user-provided content (i) that violates any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) that is unlawful, harassing, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful, invasive of another's privacy, vulgar, defamatory, false, intentionally misleading, trade libelous, pornographic, obscene, patently offensive, promotes racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual or is otherwise objectionable; (iii) that is harmful to minors in any way; or (iv) that is in violation of any law, regulation, or obligations or restrictions imposed by any third party.

You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Site's registration form.

Responsibility for Your Account
-------------------------------

To use certain features of our Site, you will need to create an account. We reserve the right to terminate the use of any account, or to deny access to the Site or any features of the Site, to anyone who violates these Terms of Service or who, in our sole judgment, interferes with the ability of others to enjoy our website or infringes the rights of others. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, and are responsible for all activities (whether by you or by others) that occur under your account.

Online Commerce
---------------

Certain sections of the Site may include links to third-party websites where you can purchase products and services online from those websites. When you click on one of these links and are redirected to the third-party website, your dealings from that point forward are with the operator of that website and not with us. We are not responsible for the quality, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or any other aspect of the third-party website or any products and services you purchase from such website.

The Site also may include e-commerce functionality that is operated by our third-party vendor that allows you to purchase products and services directly from the Site. If you purchase any of these products or services via the Site, the information that you provide as part of the transaction, such as your credit card number and contact information, will be collected by the third-party operating that portion of the Site. Our vendor may have privacy and data collection practices that are different from ours, and your purchase of products or services on or through the Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions that specifically apply to your purchase or use of such products or services, as indicated on the page of the Site where you make such purchase. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding a vendor, its online store, its privacy policies, and/or any additional terms and conditions that may apply, visit that vendor's website and click on its information links or contact the vendor directly. You release us from any damages that you incur, and agree not to assert any claims against us, arising from your purchase or use of any products or services made available through third parties via the Site.

You agree to be financially responsible for all purchases made by you or someone acting on your behalf through the Site. You agree to use the Site, and to purchase services or products through the Site, for legitimate, non-commercial purposes only. You also agree not to make any purchases for speculative, false or fraudulent purposes or for the purpose of anticipating demand for a particular product or service. You agree to only purchase goods or services for yourself or for another person for whom you are legally permitted to do so. When making a purchase for a third party that requires you to submit the third party's personal information to a vendor, you represent that you have obtained the express consent of such third party to provide such third party's personal information.

Modifications to, or Discontinuation of, the Site
-------------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site, or any portion thereof, with or without notice at any time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Site or any portion thereof.

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the mobile app is dependent on the third party from whom you received the mobile app license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play ("App Store"). You acknowledge that the Terms of Service are between you and TEGNA and not with the App Store. TEGNA, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Site, including the mobile app, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the mobile app, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Site, including the mobile app. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the mobile app is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store's terms and policies) when using the Site, including the mobile app. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms of Service and will have the right to enforce them.

Other
-----

This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter contained in this agreement and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals and communications, written or oral. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use the products or services of a third party that are provided through the Site. In the event of any conflict between any such third-party terms and conditions and these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will govern.

This Agreement is entered into in the State of New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of its choice of law rules. Each party to this Agreement hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the County of New York in the State of New York, and waives any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. In any action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

These Terms of Service are not intended to benefit any third party, and do not create any third-party beneficiaries. Accordingly, these Terms of Service may only be invoked or enforced by you or us.
