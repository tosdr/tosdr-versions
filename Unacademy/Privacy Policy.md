This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains the types of information collected by Unacademy when you use the Platform (as defined in [Terms and conditions](https://unacademy.com/terms)) that references this Policy, how we collect, use, share and store such information collected and also explains the rationale for collection of such information, the privacy rights and choices you have regarding your information submitted to us when you use the Services.

  

For ease of reference, use of the terms “Unacademy”, “we”, “us, and/or “our” refer to Sorting Hat Technologies Private Limited – a company incorporated in India and all of its affiliates which have license to host the Platform and offer Services. Similarly, use of the terms “you”, “yours” and/or “User(s)” refer to all users of the Platform and includes all Learners and Content Providers _(as more particularly defined under our [Terms and conditions](https://unacademy.com/terms))_.

  

The Services are governed by this Policy, [Terms and conditions](https://unacademy.com/terms), and any other rules, policies or guidelines published on the Platform as applicable to you. Please read this Policy carefully prior to accessing our Platform and using the Services. By accessing and using the Platform, providing your Personal Information (defined below), or by otherwise signalling your agreement when the option is presented to you, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure, sharing and storing of information described in this Policy, Terms of Service and any other rules, policies or guidelines published on the Platform as applicable to you (collectively referred to as the **“Platform Terms”**), and Unacademy disclaims all the liabilities arising therefrom. If you have inadvertently submitted any Personal Information to Unacademy prior to reading this Policy statements set out herein, or you do not agree with the way your Personal Information is collected, stored, or used, then you may access, modify and/or delete your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy (refer to the sections about **Your Choices** and **Your Rights**).
