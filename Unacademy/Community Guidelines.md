Your password should be at least eight characters in length, combine numbers and letters, and not include commonly used words.  
Select a word or acronym and insert numbers between some of the letters.  
Include Special characters.  
Mix capital and lowercase letters.  
Don't reuse passwords associated with any other type of account.  
Log out of all devices to ensure that your log-in credentials are secure.  
Register with our phone number in order to ensure you have a back up in case you forget your login details.
