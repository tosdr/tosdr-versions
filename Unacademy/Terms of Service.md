Unacademy Learner Referral Program **(“Referral Program”)** is made available through the Platform to all Learners (as defined in our [Terms and Conditions](https://unacademy.com/terms)) who are paid Subscribers on the Platform.  
  
When we refer to **“you”/ “your/s”**, we collectively mean you as the Learner on the Platform. Similarly, when we speak of **“Unacademy”, “we”, “us”,** and **“our”**, we collectively mean **Sorting Hat Technologies Private Limited** – a company incorporated in India and all its affiliates which have a license to host the Platform and offer Services. Kindly refer to the [About Unacademy and the Platform](https://unacademy.com/terms#about) section of the Terms and Conditions to know which Unacademy entity your Agreement (_as defined in [Terms and Conditions](https://unacademy.com/terms)_) will be with.  
  
Participation in our Referral Program is subject to the following terms and conditions (**“Referral Terms”**). Please take the time to read our Referral Terms and Platform Terms (as defined below). By participating in our Referral Program, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Referral Terms along with the Unacademy’s [Terms and conditions](https://unacademy.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://unacademy.com/privacy) and any other terms and conditions updated on the Platform or communicated to you from time to time (collectively referred to as the **“Platform Terms”**). If you do not agree to any of the terms and conditions, then please do not participate in our Referral Program or use our Service (as defined in our Terms and Conditions).  
  
Capitalized terms not defined in these Referral Terms shall have the meaning set forth in our Platform Terms.  
  
We may change these Referral Terms from time to time and will post any changes on the Platform or notify you via email, at our option, as soon as such changes are in effect.  
  

* **Eligibility and Participation:** Participation in the Referral Program is voluntary, and all Learners on the Platform are eligible to participate in the Referral Program. Accordingly, the ‘[Age Requirements](https://unacademy.com/terms#rights_to_accounts)’ as stated in our Platform Terms shall continue to apply to all Learners participating in the Referral Program.  
      
    
    1. Once registered on the Platform as a Learner, you will have the option to generate a referral code within your account on the Platform or otherwise as directed on the Platform or as may be communicated to you by Unacademy in writing (emails included)**(“Referral Code”)**.
    2. You may refer friends or anyone by sending them the Referral Code via the Platform, email or through any other mode or platform.
    3. Once a person registers on the Platform as a Learner and purchases a Subscription (as defined in our [Terms and conditions](https://unacademy.com/terms)) using your Referral Code, such person shall be considered as your **“Qualified Referral”**.
    
      
    Please note that Referral Codes are unique to each Learner, and only when the person registering as a Learner applies your Referral Code will he/she/they be considered as your Qualified Referral. In other words, if the person you referred has failed to enter/apply the Referral Code that is unique to you while registering as a Learner or purchasing a Subscription (as applicable) on the Platform, then such person shall not be considered as your Qualified Referral, and you shall not be eligible to receive any Referral Rewards (defined below) in respect of that person. Similarly, any failure on your part to display or share the correct Referral Code shall not be the responsibility of Unacademy.
  
* **A ‘Qualified Referral’ does NOT include the following:**

So, if your personal details, including but not limited to, last name, email address, IP address or website details, are the same as your Qualified Referral(s), then such referral will be deemed as a **“Self-Referral”**. Unacademy, in its sole discretion, will determine the classification of any referral as a **“Self-Referral”**.
    2. Referrals made to any existing Learners on the Platform shall not be deemed as Qualified Referrals; only a new user registering on the Platform using your Referral Code shall be considered as your Qualified Referral.
    3. If a Learner referred by you initiates cancellation or refund of the Subscription on the Platform within 30 (thirty) days (or such other number of days as mentioned on the Platform) from the date of purchase of the Subscription on the Platform, or if there have been any chargebacks by such Learner, then such Learner referred by you shall not be deemed as a Qualified Referral, and you shall not be entitled to any Referral Rewards in respect of such Learner.
    4. No referral by you shall be considered as a Qualified Referral, if Unacademy suspects any fraudulent activity by you to increase your Qualified Referrals, including without limitation, the use of any software that generates real and fictitious information, multiple accounts from the same users referred by you, or any activity that does not comply with the Referral Terms and/or the Platform Terms. In these cases, Unacademy shall also have the right to terminate your account and access to the Platform at its sole discretion.
    5. Where any Learner referred by you receives from or was offered coupons, refunds, credits or discounts by you to purchase a Subscription on the Platform and such offering was a not authorised by Unacademy, then such purchase by the Learner referred by you shall not amount to a Qualified Referral.
    6. If it is found by Unacademy that you have adopted marketing practices in contravention to these Referral Terms or that we deem to be unethical or are likely to attract fraudulent signups, then such Learners referred by you shall not be deemed as Qualified Referrals.
