**1\. How this Privacy Policy applies**

By visiting our Mediums or using any of our products or services, you agree and consent to your personal information being used and disclosed in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

You do not have to provide your personal information to us, but if you do not provide certain information we will only be able to provide limited products and services to you. Where you refuse to provide mandatory travel information or allow us to disclose it to required governmental agencies and as otherwise required, we will not be able to transport you.

This Privacy Policy applies even if you have booked flights via a third party (such as a travel agent or holiday company), as this Privacy Policy forms part of your [Conditions of Carriage](https://www.airarabia.com/conditions-carriage) and your contract with us for the travel and/or those products or services.

If you book a flight on behalf of someone else, you must have their consent to use their personal information.  
We will combine the information that we collect automatically from you with any other information that we collect directly from you or about you.

**4.  Sensitive personal data**

Sensitive personal data includes data about an individual's health and religion and other categories of personal data which are closely protected. We do not generally collect this information from you (or those you are booking for), but where we do, we seek to minimize the collection and use of it.

Where you have notified us of a health issue that you or someone in your booking:

* may require medical permission to fly, or special conditions or assistance whilst travelling (for example oxygen);
* is pregnant; or
* requires special assistance either on our planes, at destinations or activities or at airports,

You agree that you have voluntarily provided that information to us and that you consent (and those you are booking for consent) for us to use that information to provide you with these products or services and/or determine your fitness to avail yourself of our products or services.  
Where your religion or health status could be inferred from meal preferences, we will not link this information or use it in any other way other than to fulfil your meal request.

In each case, you specifically consent (on your behalf and on behalf of those you are booking for) that we can use your sensitive personal data and transfer outside your local country to anywhere in the world where you are travelling or have travelled from or where we provide products or services from (or the Air Arabia Group or our service providers do or your travel agent does) (see "**Disclosing your personal information**" below).

If you do not allow us to process any sensitive personal data, this may mean we are unable to provide all or parts of the services you have requested from us. Please be aware that in such circumstances you will not be entitled to cancel or obtain a refund of any price you have paid.

**5\. Using the Mediums**

(a) when you register an account with us we collect - title, first name, surname, nationality, country of residence,  date of birth (if required), phone number, email address, password;

(b) when you join Air Rewards– we collect the same information as when you register an account with us, plus in addition we collect preferred language, and the additional terms set out in the Air Rewards Program terms and conditions apply;

(c)  when you book a flight or other products or services with us we collect - passport details, date of birth, emergency contact and details of next of kin. We may collect your email address and / or phone number for boarding pass delivery during online check-in and to provide relevant information for your booking. In some countries we also need to collect your nationality and other information for tax purposes. When you visit our Mediums, we may retain some of the above information to assess the reasons in case of incomplete booking, such as lost internet connection and to support you with completing the bookings.

(d) when you are making payment we will collect different information depending on the payment method. For example for credit card payments we will collect - credit cardholder name, card number, expiry date and CVC code. You may also choose to store your credit card details with us for future use. However, we do not store your CVC/CVV code (the security code on the back of a credit card); and

(e) for adding new information and preferences to your Air Rewards profile. For example recording your preferred seat or meal on our flights.

**6\. Information about others**

You may provide us with information about others, for example:

(a) If you ask us to provide them with information or allow them to manage your booking on your behalf;

or

(b)    If you make or manage a booking for or on behalf of another person who has allowed you to do so. We need to know the names of all passengers travelling. If you are booking a flight on behalf of someone else (whether adult or a child), you must obtain their consent to use their personal information, including their sensitive personal data as described above. We proceed on the basis that you have obtained these consents. Where required by local laws, we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to, this policy. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a reference to an illness or health condition).

You may also provide information about others for purposes such as referring a friend to use so we can offer them our products or services. You must contact only those individuals via our Mediums who you know would be happy to hear from you and you must not use our products or services to send unsolicited 'spam' messages.

**7\. How and why we use your personal data**

We use the information provided in the following ways:

(a) **To fulfil our contract with you** and/or dealing with your booking or intended booking, including processing your booking, sending you your itinerary or other details relating to your booking, or contacting you if there is a problem with your booking (for example by sending you a service message or calling you to inform you when your booking has not been completed);

We will take appropriate steps to protect the personal information you share with us. We invest significant resources to protect your personal information, from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.

**11\. Cookies or other tracking technologies**

We have implemented safeguards to ensure that our service providers treat personal information in a way that is consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, and that it is not used except to fulfil products or services to us or where we believe it is necessary for a legitimate reason connected with the products or services we offer, or as set out in the **"Sensitive Personal Data"** section above.

These service providers and group companies may be located in your country, countries in the European Economic Area, in the United Arab Emirates or elsewhere in the world. Different privacy laws may apply in these countries See further detail in our **"Transfer of Your Personal Information"** section below.

**15\. Retention**

We keep records for as long as required to manage bookings and provide the other relevant products or services anticipated by this Privacy Policy, including keeping you up-to-date with our marketing, and where we are required to by law or for records purposes. We also retain your information to make your future interactions with us convenient and to personalize the products, services and communications with you.

We will retain your personal data for as long as we need it in order to fulfil our purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or in order to comply with the law.

**16\. Consent**

By choosing to provide us with your personal information you are consenting to its use in accordance with the principles outlined in this Privacy Policy and as outlined at the time you are asked to provide any personal information. We and other members of the Air Arabia Group may contact you by phone, email, SMS and mobile device messages or notifications (and gaining your consent where we are required to do so) in order to provide you with updates pertaining to our products or services as well as information about additional offers, products, services or events that we believe may be of interest to you.

**17\. Withdrawing your consent**

You do not have to provide us with your personal information. However, if you choose not to provide certain personal information we request and/or require or consent to its use and disclosure, you will still be able to visit our Mediums but you may be unable to access certain options, products or services, and in some cases we may not be able to fulfil your booking.

All marketing communications we email to you will provide you with a way to withdraw your consent to future marketing.

To opt out of mobile device messages or notifications from Air Arabia applications go into “settings” on your device and turn off notifications for the Air Arabia application.

Be aware that if you unsubscribe completely from our marketing communications we may be unable to notify you of tailored offers to meet your needs.

Please note that if you unsubscribe from marketing communications you will still receive operational and service messages from us regarding your booking and responses to your enquiries made to us, and that we may hold your details on a suppression list so we don't send you marketing communications in the future.

You also have the ability to change your cookie settings to block certain types of cookie - this is explained in more detail in our [Cookies Policy](https://www.airarabia.com/cookie-policy).

**18\. Aggregate data, data analytics and social media functionality**

We may aggregate personal information and remove any identifying elements in order to analyze patterns and improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Medium use, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize our Mediums’ content, layout, products and services, and we may appoint third parties to do this on our behalf, as set out above.

We gather certain usage information like the number and frequency of visitors to our Mediums. This information may include which webpage you just came from, which webpage you next go to, what browser you are using, your device and your IP address. This collective data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of our Mediums, and do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you.

If you use buttons on our Mediums linked to social media or similar sites (for example "Like" and/or "Share" buttons), content from our Mediums may be sent back to that other website or service and, depending on your privacy settings, may be privately or publicly visible (for example to friends, followers or generally to anyone who has access to your profile page).

**19\. Do Not Track**

Currently, our systems do not honor browser do-not-track requests; you may delete cookies and other tracking technologies using the processes specified in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.airarabia.com/cookie-policy).

**20\. Transfer of your personal information**

Some parties that process or store personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy may be located in jurisdictions outside your country of residence or our country of incorporation. Therefore, you understand and unambiguously agree that your information may be processed and stored in these jurisdictions and that different privacy laws may apply in these countries which may not ensure the same level of data protection as granted in your country of residence. We only make these arrangements or transfers where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect any information held in that country or that the service provider acts at all times in compliance with applicable privacy laws. Where required under applicable laws we will take measures to ensure that personal information handled in other countries will receive at least the same level of protection as it is given in your home country.

In the event your personal information is transferred to a foreign jurisdiction, it may be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction and we may be required to disclose it to the courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities in those jurisdictions but we will only do so where required by applicable laws.
