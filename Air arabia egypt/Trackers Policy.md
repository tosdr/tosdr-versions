Terms and conditions

Cookie policy
=============

Cookie Settings

**Overview**

By using this airarabia.com website and our mobile applications and mobile websites (the “Mediums”) you agree and consent that we and third parties can store and access cookies, IP addresses and use other tracking technology methods to enable Medium functionality, collect aggregated data about website usage, improve your online experience and manage and tailor our advertising and service communications with you. There are means of disabling cookies as set out below if you choose to do so, however this may affect your use of our Mediums. See below for more information about what cookies are, the tracking technology we use, and how we use them.

**Learn about Cookies?**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize the device you are using and provide you with a better website experience.

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer or mobile device you are using via a randomly generated identifying tag.

**Find out how Air Arabia uses Cookies**

To make full use of the Mediums, your computer, tablet or mobile phone will need to accept Cookies. Air Arabia uses Cookies to give you a better experience. For example Air Arabia uses Cookies in the following ways:

* To enable progression through the booking process to ensure that you have a seamless booking experience on airarabia.com.
* To provide information that can help us to understand what interested you about our website and emails and what did not. This helps us provide you with more personalized features, and more relevant information on subsequent visits.
* To record information such as aspects of your last flight search to make subsequent searches faster and also to enable us to tailor airarabia.com to your preferences.
* To measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site.  
     

**See what types of Cookie Air Arabia uses & our Cookie policy**

Our Mediums use different types of cookies. Session cookies exist just for your session on our Medium and persistent cookies exist for a period of time after your visit. First party cookies are cookies set by our Mediums and third party cookies are set by third party platforms. We utilize both session and persistent cookies, and first and third party cookies.

We also use cookies for different purposes. For example, we use some cookies to provide a seamless service when you use Air Rewards or complete a booking, or where you don't complete a booking (so we can inform you of this and provide assistance) and other cookies to improve our use of advertising to make it relevant to you. To assist you, we've provided a more detailed explanation of the main types of cookies we use below categorized by the purpose of the cookies.

* **Strictly Necessary Cookies -** These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our websites, progress or complete a booking or make use of other online services we provide. They also include cookies that help us understand how users use our website, allowing us to improve the overall experience without being able to identify or target you or any other user individually. If you disable these cookies then you may not be able to use our Platforms fully or at all.
* **Analytical/performance cookies –** these allow us to count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Mediums. We aggregate this data and analyze it to improve the way our Mediums work and the user experience, for example, by improving the Medium’s layout. We use trusted third party analytics providers’ tools to enable this analysis.
* **Cookies for enhancing your experience -** these are used to recognize you when you return to our Mediums. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, provide your Air Rewards details if you are registered and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region) and to identify to us where you don't complete a booking (so we can inform you of this and provide assistance).
* **Targeting cookies -** These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
  
 

We also use third party cookie providers to assist us in providing you with a better service and to help us analyze our customers' behavior. Third parties we engage have the obligations set out in the our Privacy Policy.

**How can I reject cookies and/or delete existing cookies?**

Modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. You can set your browsers or devices to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalized features cannot then be provided to you and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website's features. Each browser is different, so check the ‘help’, 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

You can also visit https://www.aboutcookies.org/ which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. This site includes details on how to delete cookies from your computer as well as more general information about cookies.

We do not recommend turning cookies off when visiting our websites as this could disadvantage you by preventing you from making bookings with Air Rewards, or preventing you from booking certain types of fares on airarabia.com (i.e. Basic, Value and Extra). It may also mean that certain parts or functions of our websites do not work properly. Please also note that if you delete your cookies we may no longer automatically recognize that you have agreed to our Privacy Policy, this Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies policy and website terms and conditions and may ask for confirmation of this along with your language and country preferences.

**Other tracking technologies**

We use clear image files, pixel tags and other similar technology embedded within emails we send to you and on our Mediums. These files are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear images are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails. We may use clear images (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with the Mediums to, among other things, track the activities of Medium visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of the Mediums. We and our third party service providers also use clear images in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
