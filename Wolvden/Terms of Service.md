    2. Please read these Terms of Service carefully. They replace any previous versions. By registering for or playing our Game (as defined below) you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please print or save these terms for future use as we will not keep a file copy specifically for the transaction with you and we cannot guarantee that they will remain accessible on our website in future. These Terms of Service are available in the English language only.
2. **Definitions**
    1. Capitalised terms have the following meanings in these Terms of Service:

        2. "our Game" – our online game called "Wolvden" - including our website and any related software and services.
        3. "Currency" – our in-game virtual currencies including GC and SC.
        4. "GC" – "Gold Cones", one kind of Currency.
