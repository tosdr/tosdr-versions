Swish Fibre Cookies Policy
==========================

​
=

This policy is effective from 1st February 2024.

​

This policy applies to the Swish Fibre website, which is owned by Cuckoo Fibre Limited (a company incorporated in England and Wales with company registration number 15060036 and whose registered office is at 6th Floor, 33 Holborn, London, EC1N 2HT). Swish Fibre is a brand name of Cuckoo Fibre Limited. All references to “Swish” and “Swish Fibre” should be read accordingly.

The Swish website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users, to improve your experience on the Swish website and to recommend content that may be of interest to you. When you visit the Swish website we will ask you whether you agree to our use of cookies.

1\. COOKIES – PRIVACY AND YOUR RIGHTS

​

Cookies are used to uniquely identify a person, and therefore at Swish, we treat them as personal identifiable information.   Cookies are used for analytics and advertising to improve the experience and relevance of our website.  At Swish we want our customers to understand what cookies are by being jargon free, whilst also being transparent about how we use them. 

As a user of our website, we want you to have a choice and simply browsing our website does not mean that you agree to the use of cookies.  We notify you when you first visit our website that we use cookies via a pop-up notice which refers you to our Cookie Policy so that you can learn more about our cookies. The pop-up notice will prompt you to either accept the use of our cookies and continue to our website or review and, if you wish, change your cookie settings.

2\. WHAT ARE COOKIES?

​

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media and advertisements.   There are different types of cookies.   Cookies served by the company that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies”.   Therefore, cookies served by Swish while you are visiting at [www.swishfibre.com](http://www.swishfibre.com/) are first party cookies.

Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you are visiting are called “third party cookies”.  For example, we may allow Google to set a cookie on your browser while you visit [www.swishfibre.com](http://www.swishfibre.com/) and that would be a third party cookie.  Cookies may also endure for different periods of time.   “Session cookies” only last as long as your browser is open.  These are deleted automatically once you close your browser.  Other cookies are “persistent cookies”, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed.  For example they may recognise your device when you re-open your browser and browse the internet again.

3\. WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?

​

We use the following cookies:

Essential cookies

​

Our website won't work properly without our Essential cookies which cannot be turned off in our system. They help you move around the secure areas of the website and do things like shopping or eBilling.

Essential cookies remember things like products you put in your basket and information you enter in forms such as our checkout. Without these cookies, this information would be lost every time you go to a new page.

Analytical and performance cookies

​

These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the Swish website, how long they stay and how visitors move around the Swish website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way the Swish website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

The information generated relating to the Swish website may be used to create reports about the use of the Swish website. 

We may use analytics service providers in relation to the Swish website’s traffic analysis and reporting and the analytics service provider may also store relevant traffic analysis information. 

Advertising and targeting cookies

​

These cookies record your visit to the Swish website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other websites. We will use this information to try and make the Swish website and other websites that you visit more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.

Functionality cookies

​

We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made in relation to the Swish website so as to provide a more personalised experience and enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.

4\. THIRD PARTY COOKIES

​

We may have links to other organisations’ websites, apps or social plug-ins.   When we include these links , it gives those sites the flexibility to use cookies. They can’t read any cookies we set from our Swish website, and we can’t read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the Swish website, and it also lets them know whether you’re logged in. Other websites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.

5\. HOW DO I TURN COOKIES OFF?

You can use your browser settings to accept or reject new cookies and to delete existing cookies. You can also set your browser to notify you each time new cookies are placed on your computer or other device.

If you would like to opt out of cookies you can change the settings on your internet browser to reject cookies. You can find more detailed information about how you can manage cookies at the All About Cookies and Your Online Choices websites. Please note that if you do set your browser to reject cookies you may not be able to use the features of the Swish website.

This Cookies Policy may change from time to time and, if it does, the up-to-date version will always be available on our website. Please note that by continuing to use our website you are agreeing to any updated versions.
