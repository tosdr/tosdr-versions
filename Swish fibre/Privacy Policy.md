2.3 Information collected from others:
--------------------------------------

​We may supplement the information that we collect from you and about your use of our products and/or services, with information that we receive from third parties.

​

​This may include:

​

* Data accessible to us from publicly available sources such as councils, company registers, land registry, electoral rolls and online search engines

* Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with products or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.​
    

3\. WHY WE MAY COLLECT DATA ABOUT YOU
=====================================

​There are many reasons why we may legitimately collect and process your personal information and data, including:

3.1 Contractual Obligations
---------------------------

​We may process your personal information where it is necessary either to take steps at your request before entering into a contract with you for the provision of our products and/or services, or to perform our obligations under that contract.

Examples of these situations include:

​

* To provide you with a quote for our products and/or services
    
* To determine your eligibility for our products and/or services / whether they are available in your area
    
* To process your orders for our products and services and to bill you for the same
    
* To provide you with the products and services you have ordered from us
    
* To respond to any questions or complaints you may have regarding our products and services
    
* To administer, operate, facilitate and manage the products and services Swish provides to you
    
* To analyse your data for the purpose of improving your experience and protecting you on-line
    
* To manage the best way of routing your data usage through the various parts of our network, equipment and systems
    
* To contact you or, if applicable, your designated representative(s) by post, telephone, electronic mail, etc., in connection with your relationship and/or account
    

Examples of your personal information that we may process under this legal basis include:

​

* Your contact details, including name, address, phone number, date of birth, gender, email address, passwords and credentials (such as your security questions and answers), and other information needed to confirm your identity and your communications with us
    

* Your communications with us, such as calls, emails and webchats
    
* Your payment and financial information
    
* Details from the products and services we have provided to you, such as data usage, connected device details, routers, calls made and received.
    

3.2 Legal Compliance
--------------------

​If the law or any regulator in any competent jurisdiction requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data and also provide this to any such regulator. However, we would need to be satisfied that a request for information is lawful and proportionate and we would need appropriate assurances about security, how the information is used and how long it is kept.

We must consider the needs of vulnerable people, e.g. people with disabilities, the elderly and those on low incomes. We will take steps to identify and record information about our vulnerable customers’ needs so that we can provide them with the help and support that they need to use our services effectively. Please see our Vulnerable Customer Policy for more details.

If you order a voice service (e.g. call forwarding), we will ask if you want your details included in any telephone directory services, so your details can be included in phone books and be found using publicly available directory enquiry services. If you do, we will share that information with regulated providers of directory services. Ex-directory numbers will not be included and will not appear in any directory service database.

For health and safety compliance purposes and subcontractor assurance, we may be required to obtain training and competency records of sub-contractor staff deployed in the installation of our services.

3.3 Legitimate Interest
-----------------------

​
-

We may also use your personal data where it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) but only in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and only where such interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights, freedoms or interests.

​

It is in our interests to ensure that our processes and systems operate effectively and that we can continue operating as a business.

​

We may also process your personal data to negotiate and manage a wayleave agreement between us and you, as the land or property owner, to grant us permission to install, maintain and repair the network equipment on your property.

​

We may also use your personal information for the legitimate interest of helping to prevent and detect crime and fraud and to prevent and detect criminal attacks on our network or against your equipment. We monitor traffic over our network, trace nuisance or malicious usage, and track malware and cyber-attacks.

​

Examples of the personal information that we may process under this legal basis include:

-----------

​
-

5. SHARING YOUR DATA OUTSIDE THE UK
===================================

​
=

​The data and information that we collect and process may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the UK. We will only transfer your personal data outside the UK on the basis that anyone to whom we transfer it protects your data and information in a similar way to us.

​

In the event that we transfer your information to countries outside the UK, we will only do so where:

​

* the UK Government has decided that the country to which we are transferring your data is deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your information, or
    
* we have entered into a contract with the organisation, entity or individual with whom we are sharing your data and/or information on such terms as approved by the UK Government or the ICO to ensure your information is adequately protected.
    

6\. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATA
============================

​
=

The security of your information is important to us. Any information sent to us is protected using robust security methods. The methods we use are industry-standard ensuring data is safeguarded. Our security measures include:

​

* Encryption of data where appropriate
    
* Regular penetration testing of systems
    
* Security controls which protect the entire Swish Information Technology infrastructure from external attack and unauthorised access
    
* Regular cyber security assessments of all service providers who may handle your personal data
    
* Regular scenario planning and crisis management exercises to ensure we are ready to respond to cyber security attacks and data security incidents
    
* Internal policies setting out our data security approach
    
* Training for employees on security and privacy
    

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and although we will do our best to protect your information and/or personal data, we cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information you transmit to us using online methods.

7\. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION
=====================================

​By providing you with products or services, we create records that contain your information, and/or data such as customer account records, activity records, tax records and lending and credit account records. Records can be held on a variety of media (physical or electronic) and in a number of formats.

We manage our records to help us to serve our customers well (for example for operational reasons, such as dealing with any queries relating to your account) and to comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements. Records help us demonstrate that we are meeting our responsibilities and provide evidence of our business activities.

Retention periods for records are determined based on the type of record, the nature of the activity, product or service, applicable local legal or regulatory requirements. Retention periods may be changed from time to time based on business or legal and regulatory requirements. However, we will only retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it.

We may, on exception, retain your information for longer periods, particularly where we need to withhold destruction or disposal based on an order from any courts of competent authority, or in relation to an investigation by law enforcement agencies or our regulators. This is intended to make sure that we are able to produce records as evidence, if needed to those respective authorities.
