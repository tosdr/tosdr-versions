Swish Fibre Customer Complaints Policy
======================================

​This policy is effective from 1 February 2024.
===============================================

​
=

1\. Introduction
================

This customer complaints policy applies to Cuckoo Fibre Limited. Swish Fibre is a brand name of Cuckoo Fibre Limited. All references to “Swish” or “Swish Fibre” should be read accordingly.

Swish always aims to provide you with the best service possible. If you ever feel we’ve fallen short of this, please let us know. Our Customer Care team will always try to put things right straight away and limit any disruption or dissatisfaction you might be experiencing. We’re fully committed to addressing all complaints, fully and fairly, and in a reasonable timeframe. We will do what we can to resolve your complaint, and the feedback we receive from you will be used to help improve our services for other customers.

​

This Customer Complaints Policy explains how to go about making a complaint and how to take it further if you need to.

2\. Our Complaints Process
==========================

​
=

How to make a complaint

​

Our complaints procedure has four stages:

​

Stage 1: Contact our Customer Care Team. In the first instance, they will be able to investigate your complaint, and where you have contacted us by telephone, will do their best to resolve this while they are on the call with you.

​

Stage 2: If you are not happy with the solution our Customer Care Team have suggested, you can ask to escalate your complaint to a Complaints Specialist. The Complaints Specialist will aim to respond to you within one working day. They will either suggest a resolution to your complaint, or explain what is happening - for example, if the complaint has been escalated to another team. In these cases, you will be given a timeframe telling you when we will come back to you again.

​

Stage 3: If you feel the Complaints Specialist has been unable to satisfactorily resolve your complaint, you can ask for your complaint to be escalated to the Team Manager. They will review your complaint and respond to you within 5 working days.

​

Stage 4: If, after following the process above, you’re still not happy with the outcome of your complaint, you can refer it to independent adjudication (see Section 3).

​

3\. Independent Adjudication
============================

​
=

If your complaint is not settled within 8 weeks, you can refer it to the Ombudsman Service, using the Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme. The ombudsman can’t deal with complaints about commercial policy (like our prices or broadband availability) and they can’t help businesses with more than ten employees. But they will give you advice if you’re a home or small business customer who complained eight or more weeks ago, or if we have issued you with a “deadlock” letter. You may request a deadlock letter within the eight-week period, but we may refuse to issue one to you in this period if we believe we will be able to resolve your complaint shortly.

​

To use the Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme:

​

* Visit [https://www.ombudsman-services.org/complain-now](https://www.ombudsman-services.org/complain-now)
    
* Phone 0330 440 1614
    
* Textphone 0330 440 1600
    
* Email [enquiry@commsombudsman.org](mailto:enquiry@commsombudsman.org)
    
* Write to them at Ombudsman Services: Communications, PO Box 730, Warrington, WA4 6WU.
    

​

If you’d like any more help or advice, you can talk to your local Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) for free. Please be aware this isn’t part of the formal complaint process.

​

4\. How to Contact Us
=====================

​
=

There are three different ways to contact us if you need to make a complaint.

​

By Telephone

You can give our Customer Success team a ring on 0800 048 9415. We’ll do our best to resolve your complaint on the call, but sometimes we’ll need to investigate things in more detail and reaching a resolution may take longer.

​

By Email

​

You can email the team on [customercare@swishfibre.com](mailto:customercare@swishfibre.com). We always aim to resolve complaints in the first instance and aim to respond within 1 working day. If your complaint is more complex, this could take a little longer. This depends on the issues you’ve raised, as we always try to give your comments the attention they deserve. Please remember to give us your details, including:

​

* Your Customer number (if applicable)
    
* Your full address
    
* Your contact number
    

This way, we can get back to you as quickly as possible.

​

By Post

​

It’s not as quick, but if you prefer to send us a letter, you can write to us at:

Customer Care Team,

Swish Fibre Ltd

Swish Fibre

Milford House

Pynes Hill

Exeter

EX2 5TH

​

Your letter will be acknowledged within 2 working days of receipt and we aim to resolve all written complaints within 28 days once we’ve received them.

5\. How We Will Contact You
===========================

​
=

We always investigate every complaint and actively work to resolve things to your satisfaction. We’ll let you know as soon as we think we have a resolution. If you have contacted us by telephone, this could be on the original call, if we can sort things out there and then, or if we can’t, we’ll be back in touch to let you know.

​

In the first instance, we’ll try to contact you by your preferred contact method (if you have told us what it is). If your preferred contact method is telephone and we miss you, we’ll drop you a text with our telephone number so you can ring us back when you’re free during our opening hours.

​

If your preferred contact method is telephone and we can’t reach you to let you know about our proposed resolution, we’ll email you instead or we’ll write to your home address.

​

Your case will remain open for 28 days from the date of our response, so you’ll have enough time to review and consider our proposal. If you are happy with the resolution, please let us know so we can close your case down.

​

If we don’t hear from you within the 28 days from the date of our response, we’ll take this as confirmation you’re satisfied with the resolution and we’ll contact you again to let you know we’re closing your complaint.
