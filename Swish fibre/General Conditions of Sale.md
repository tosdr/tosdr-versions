Guidance on billing, compensation, refunds, and debt collection



This guidance is effective from 1 June 2023. Unless otherwise defined in this guidance, capitalised

terms have the meaning given to them in the Terms for Residential Services and Terms for

Business Service, as applicable. This guidance applies only to residential customers and business

customers who are either a Not-for-Profit Customer (which means a body for which no more than

10 individuals work as employees or otherwise (but excluding volunteers) or a Small Enterprise

Customer (which means a business for which no more than 10 individuals work (whether as

employees or volunteers or otherwise)).

Billing



1. Your Order Confirmation will set out your monthly charges, as well as any one-off fees such

as for activation and installation. Further information on our charges and fees is available from

the applicable Charges and Fees document in the Legal section of the Swish Fibre website

(swishfibre.com/legal).

2. You will pay for your services monthly in advance. Payments must be made by direct debit

unless another payment method is noted on your invoice. When paying by direct debt, your

first monthly payment will be taken within five days of your services being activated and on the

same day thereafter (or the next working day if the relevant day is a non-working day).

3. If we do not have a valid direct debit for you at any point, we will contact you to set one up. It

is important that you respond to this message and set up a new direct debit. Otherwise, you

are likely to miss a payment and begin falling into debt.

4. Please also contact us as soon as possible if you believe that there is anything wrong with your

monthly charges.



Compensation



5. We understand that your time is precious and that our Services are important for you

professionally and in your personal life. If we arrange an installation or service appointment for

a specific day and miss it, then unless we have given you at least 24 hours’ notice, we will

provide you with a £15 service credit.

6. If the activation of your service is delayed, and it is our fault, for example because we missed

an installation appointment without giving you 24 hours’ notice, then we will also give you £5

of service credit for every day of delay up to a maximum of 20 days.

7. If your service has stopped working, is not fully fixed two full working days after you first report

it to us and it is our fault, we will give you £5 of service credit for every day it is not fixed up to

a maximum of 20 days.

8. Please see the table in Annex A for more information.

9. Please note that if you are a Not-for-Profit Customer or are a Small Enterprise Customer, and

you have a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with us, then the compensation arrangements set

out in that SLA will apply and not the arrangements set out in this document.



Refunds



10. You may be entitled to a refund or pro-rata refund in the following circumstances:

a) If you are a Residential Customer and you cancel your order by contacting us within

14 days of the Initial Order Confirmation being sent to you.

b) If you are a Residential Customer and we terminate your contract on any date before

the Activation Date and you have paid for Services that have not been provided (e.g.

any upfront costs).

c) If you are a Residential Customer and you cancel your Voice Service during a monthly

billing period, less any Early Termination Charges or other fees or charges that you

may owe us.

d) If you terminate your contract in accordance with clause 9 of the Residential Terms or

clause 10 of the Business Terms, less any Early Termination Charges or other fees or

charges that you may owe us.

e) If we end the contract in accordance with clause 11 of the Residential Terms or

Business Terms.

11. Please contact our Customer Care team for more information, using the contact details below.



Missed Payments



12. If you miss a payment, we will contact you. We understand that circumstances can change. If

you are experiencing financial difficulties, please do get in touch with us. We are here to help,

and we can discuss options to support you, such as:

a) Lowering the cost of your monthly package by moving you to a less expensive speed

tariff or removing some of the additional services you take.

b) Setting up a payment plan to allow you to pay off any debts that you have built up over

a reasonable period.

c) Agreeing to a limited payment deferral period to allow you some time to put your

financial affairs in order.

13. If you are struggling financially, we would also advise you to contact Citizens Advice

(citizensadvice/org.uk) or a free debt charity such as Step Change (stepchange.org) or the

National Debtline (nationaldebtline.org), who can provide additional help and support.

14. If you miss a payment(s), we will make several attempts to contact you, using different

communications methods, such as phone, email, and letter. If you do not contact us in

response, we will likely suspend your services. Before we suspend your services for a failure

to pay, we will normally give you 20 working days’ notice. We will also give you a final warning

five days beforehand.

15. If you take our Voice Services, then if we suspend your Voice Services, then that we will stop

you from being able to make outgoing calls, except for calls to the emergency services.

16. If your account is suspended and you still do not contact us, then we will terminate your contract

and ask you to return any equipment to us, such as our router (sometimes also called a pod

or plume). Please note that if your contract is terminated, you may still be subject to early

termination fees and additional charges. Please see the applicable Charges and Fees

document in the Legal section of our website for more information (swishfibre.com/legal).

17. We reserve the right to turn any outstanding debt over to a debt collection agency or to bring

civil proceedings ourselves to recover any money owed. However, this is very much a last

resort that we wish to avoid. If you contact us, we will do everything we can to help if you are

experiencing financial difficulties.
