We process your Personal Data for the following purposes. Whenever We process your Personal Data, We do so on the basis of a legal "justification" (or legal basis) for processing, which We have identified in the table below.

| 6.  | To enable us to detect multi-accounts | This processing is based on BGA's legitimate interest. Indeed, the legitimate interest of the data controller is to ensure a friendly gaming environment by allowing an informational notice to be displayed when two players at the same game table have the same IP address. |
| 7.  | To provide You with commercial information about the Services and/or the Applications | We consider that it is in our legitimate interest to keep Users informed about our Services and Applications accessible from the BGA Sites, as this helps Us to ensure the continuity and development of our business. However, where the law requires BGA to obtain your consent before sending You such information, BGA will rely on your consent to process it. |
| 8.  | In connection with a restructuring operation and/or a merger-acquisition of BGA | We consider it to be in our interest to be able to make informed decisions about the future of our company in order to maintain and develop our business. |
| 9.  | The Content will remain associated with the Username even after deletion of your Account and/or your Personal Data | For the sake of consistency and comprehensibility of the Sites, We consider that it is in our legitimate interest to keep on the Sites your Content associated with the User Name that You have given to your profile during the legal retention periods. You may at any time request the specific deletion of Content that is harmful to a User's interest |
| 10. | For Us to comply with any applicable law, court order, legal process, or requirements of a regulatory body. | This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations. |
| 11. | To assert our legal rights and obligations and for any legal proceedings involving You, initiated by or against You. | We consider it to be in our legitimate interest to protect our organisation against any breach of a legal obligation owed to it and to defend Ourselves in the event of litigation. |
| 12. | To protect the rights of third parties. | This processing is necessary to comply with the legal obligations to which BGA is subject. This processing is also necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by BGA. We consider that we have a legitimate interest in ensuring that our activities do not infringe the rights of third parties. |
| 13. | To respond to your requests to exercise your rights under the conditions of Article 8 | This processing is necessary to comply with the legal obligations to which BGA is subject. |
| 14. | To provide you with business information about (i) Asmodee's and/or Partners' similar Products and Services (ii) [Asmodee Group](https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/corporate/uploads/Templates/Asmodee_group_companies_EN.pdf) and/or (iii) third-party partners. | We consider it in our legitimate interest to keep our customers informed about our Products and Services, but also the similar products and services offered by by the group to which we belong, its Partners or third-party partners, as this helps us ensure the sustainability and growth of our businesses. However, where the law requires BGA to obtain your consent before sending you such information, BGA will rely on your consent to proceed with the processing. |
| 15. | To provide you with personalized advertisements on social networks (using as a unique identifier the same email address you may have provided to create your user accounts on both BGA and the social network platforms). | If you are an existing customer and live in a relevant country (e.g., Canada, France, United Kingdom, United States), we consider that we have a legitimate interest in providing you with personalized advertisements about our Products and Services, as well as similar products and services offered by the Asmodee Group, as it helps us to sustain and develop our business.  <br>  <br>However, if you are not an existing customer or if you live in a country where the law requires BGA to obtain your consent before offering you personalized advertisements on social networks (for example, Germany), BGA will rely on your consent in order to proceed with the intended processing. |

In order to ensure compliance with the T&Cs and in particular with the rules of conduct, BGA has implemented a BGA Moderation Policy which allows it to sanction the behaviour of Users concerned

BGA uses automated tools to collect this Personal Data and to detect inappropriate behaviour by Users, in particular with a rating system (Karma score) based on a score of 100, which may vary according to the behaviour detected and, consequently, influence the User's reputation.

BGA also gives Users the opportunity to help it ensure compliance with the G.T. and the BGA Moderation Policy. In particular, on the Player Site, Users can "report" a User's behaviour by using the feature provided for this purpose on the User's profile or by clicking on the "Red Thumb" at the end of a game. These tools enable BGA to apply an automated decision to sanction the User concerned.

In this context, the User concerned receives an email informing them of the sanction taken by BGA against them.

In accordance with the BGA Moderation Policy, Users have the right to appeal the moderation decision that has been applied to them by contacting Us using BGA Contact page.

When You play Applications involving multiple Users, please note that some Personal Data will be made public and therefore accessible to other Users, such as your Username, statistical data and game performance data. The data of the Content published in the context of chats and forums may also be made public to Users and Internet Users.

#### 5\. Who do We share your Personal Data with?

We may share your Personal Data with different categories of recipients, in order to provide You with the Services:

| Internal recipients | External recipients |
| --- | --- |
| Authorized personnel from the marketing department, the departments responsible for customer relations and prospecting, the administrative and legal departments, the logistics and IT departments and their line managers. | \- other Asmodee Group companies;  <br>\- our Partners;  <br>\- social networks (Instagram and Facebook);  <br>\- court officers, if any;  <br>\- authorized personnel of subcontractors (data hosting/storage, software publishers, solutions allowing connection and access to our services, etc.). |

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and there may be other instances where We share your data with third parties where it is in BGA's legitimate interest, permitted by applicable law, or where it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which We are subject.

We may share your Personal Information with different categories of third parties, depending on our needs:

1\. Subsidiaries, a list of which is available [by clicking here](https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/corporate/uploads/Templates/Asmodee_group_companies_EN.pdf),

2\. Third party service providers (maintenance, payment, marketing services, etc.),

3\. Our professional advisors such as lawyers and accountants, auditors,

4\. Government or regulatory authorities,

5\. Professional insurers or any other relevant type of insurer,

6\. Regulatory authorities / tax authorities / company registers, and banks.

In this context, your Personal Data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), to countries that do not offer a level of protection to your Personal Data equivalent to that which You enjoy within the EEA, such as China, the USA, Canada, etc. In the absence of an adequacy decision by the European Commission, the transfer of your Personal Data will be governed by the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or any other legal protection mechanism in accordance with applicable law.

#### 6\. How long do we keep your Personal Data?

As a matter of principle, your Personal Data is kept only for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected.

Thus, when your Account is created, your identification data, your data relating to your personal life and your profile data are kept in an active database, until your Account is deleted.

Data relating to the behaviour and reputation of Users is kept in an active database, until the Account is deleted.

In the latter cases, your Personal Data will be archived and kept for a period of five (5) years from the date of your last connection, in accordance with the limitation period under ordinary law.

Statistical data of the Applications (history of games played on the Applications, preferences of your Applications, time spent playing on the Applications) is kept in an active database, until your Account is deleted.

However, in certain cases, Your Personal Data cannot be completely erased in order to ensure a consistent experience for Users of the BGA Sites. For example, games in the Applications that You have played that affect the data and scores of other Users will not be deleted. In this case, Your Personal Data will be kept for ten (10) years from the date of Your last connection and then anonymised.

Connection data (time and place of your activities, username and IP address) are kept for a period of one (1) year, in an active database, from your last connection. Other IP addresses are kept for a period of 30 days, in an active database.

Data of Content communicated on the Applications (in particular through chats) is kept for a period of three (3) months, in an active database, from the date of sending. Private messages are kept until they are expressly deleted.

However, in accordance with our General Terms of Service, the data of Content that You publish on the forums of the BGA Sites remains even after the deletion of your Account and/or of your Personal Data, it being understood that the Content remains associated with your Username and/or your avatar. You may at any time request the specific deletion of Content that would infringe your rights under the conditions of Article 8 of this Privacy Policy.

In addition, We may retain some of your data for a longer period of time, for example where We are required to do so by law or where the data is necessary to establish a right or contract. This is particularly the case for your data related to transactions, the amount of transactions you have made and the date and time of these transactions).

In this case, your Personal Data will be archived and kept for a period of ten (10) years in accordance with the statutory limitation period and/or in accordance with our tax and accounting obligations.

Once the retention periods have expired, we will ensure that your Personal Data is anonymised or deleted.

#### 7\. Security of your Personal Data

We are committed to ensuring the security of your Personal Data and have implemented information systems security policies and appropriate technical rules and measures to protect against unauthorised access, modification, use and disclosure, unlawful destruction or accidental loss of such data.

All of our employees, consultants, affiliates and subcontractors who have access to your Personal Data and are involved in its processing are required to maintain its confidentiality.

• Security of your password

We take every precaution to ensure the secure storage of your password associated with your Account. However, the security of this password also depends on its design. We therefore remind You that to be valid, your password must be composed of at least 8 characters, at least 3 of the following 4 types: upper case, lower case, numbers, special characters

The French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) recommends creating complex passwords, such as:

◦ Keep only the first few letters of words in a sentence; for example, the sentence "A Passwords needs to be remembered! " corresponds to the password "1p@ntbr!"

◦ By capitalizing the word if it is a noun

◦ By keeping punctuation marks (e.g.: !)

◦ By expressing the numbers using the digits from 0 to 9 (e.g.: One ->1)

• Security of transactions

In accordance with the T&Cs, the Player Site uses technology from third party service providers to secure Users' bank transactions.

Thus, during payment on the Player Site, Users' bank details are transmitted in encrypted form to third party service providers without BGA being able to access them or to know them in any way whatsoever.

BGA therefore does not collect the User's credit card number, its cryptogram or any other banking information.

Thus, to exercise their rights such as those identified in Article 8, relating to their credit card details, the User is therefore invited to contact payment service providers directly, if necessary.

#### 8\. What are your rights?

| 7.  | Pour Vous communiquer des informations commerciales sur les Services et/ou les Applications | Nous considérons qu'il est dans notre intérêt légitime de tenir les Utilisateurs informés de nos Services et des Applications qui sont accessibles depuis les Sites BGA, car cela Nous aide à assurer la pérennité et le développement de nos activités. Cependant, lorsque la loi exige que BGA obtienne votre consentement avant de Vous envoyer de tels renseignements, BGA s’appuiera sur votre consentement afin de procéder au traitement. |
| 8.  | En relation avec une opération de restructuration et/ou d’une fusion-acquisition de BGA | Nous considérons qu’il est dans notre intérêt d’être en mesure de prendre des décisions concernant l’avenir de notre entreprise de manière informée, dans le but de préserver et de développer nos activités commerciales. |

Vous pouvez à tout moment demander la suppression spécifique du Contenu qui porterait atteinte à l'intérêt d'un Utilisateur |
| 10. | Pour Nous conformer à toute loi applicable, ordonnance judiciaire, procédure judiciaire, ou aux exigences d'un organisme de réglementation. | Ce traitement est nécessaire au respect de nos obligations légales. |
| 11. | Pour faire valoir nos droits et obligations juridiques et pour toute procédure judiciaire Vous impliquant, initiée par ou contre Vous. | Nous considérons qu'il est dans notre intérêt légitime de protéger notre organisation contre toute violation d'une obligation légale qui lui est due et de Nous défendre en cas de litige. |
| 12. | Pour protéger les droits des tiers. | Ce traitement est nécessaire au respect des obligations légales auxquelles BGA est soumise. Ce traitement est également nécessaire aux fins des intérêts légitimes poursuivis par BGA.

| 13. | Pour répondre à vos demandes d’exercice de vos droits dans les conditions de l’article 8 | Ce traitement est nécessaire au respect des obligations légales auxquelles BGA est soumise. |
| 14. | Pour vous communiquer des informations commerciales concernant (i) les Produits et Services similaires d’Asmodee et/ou des Partenaires (ii) le [Groupe Asmodee](https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/corporate/uploads/Templates/Asmodee_group_companies_EN.pdf) et/ou (iii) des partenaires tiers. | Nous considérons qu’il est dans notre intérêt légitime de tenir nos clients informés de nos Produits et Services, mais aussi des produits et services similaires proposés par le groupe dont nous faisons partie, ses Partenaires ou des partenaires tiers, car cela nous aide à assurer la pérennité et le développement de nos activités. Toutefois, lorsque la loi exige que BGA obtienne votre consentement avant de vous envoyer de telles informations, BGA s’appuiera sur votre consentement afin de procéder au traitement. |
| 15. | Pour vous proposer des publicités personnalisées sur les réseaux sociaux (en utilisant comme identifiant unique la même adresse électronique que vous avez peut-être fournie pour la création de vos comptes d’utilisateur à la fois sur Asmodee et sur les plateformes de réseaux sociaux). | Si vous êtes un client existant et que vous vivez dans un pays concerné (par exemple, le Canada, la France, le Royaume-Uni, les États-Unis), nous considérons que nous avons un intérêt légitime à vous proposer des publicités personnalisées concernant nos Produits et Services, mais aussi les produits et services similaires proposés par le Groupe Asmodee, car cela nous aide à assurer la pérennité et le développement de nos activités.  <br>  <br>Toutefois, si vous n’êtes pas un client existant ou si vous vivez dans un pays où la loi exige que BGA obtienne votre consentement avant de vous proposer des publicités personnalisées sur les réseaux sociaux (par exemple, l’Allemagne), BGA s’appuiera sur votre consentement afin de procéder au traitement envisagé. |

Pour permettre de veiller au respect des CG et notamment des règles de conduite, BGA a mis en place une Politique de Modération de BGA quia lui permet de sanctionner le comportement des Utilisateurs concernés

BGA utilise ainsi des outils automatisés afin de collecter ces Données Personnelles et détecter les comportements inappropriés des Utilisateurs avec notamment un système de notation (score de Karma) basé sur un score de 100, lequel est amené à varier en fonction des comportements détectés et, par conséquent, à influer la réputation de l’Utilisateur.

BGA donne également la possibilité aux Utilisateurs de l’aider à veiller au respect des CG et de la Politique de Modération de BGA. Par exemple, sur le Site Joueur, les Utilisateurs peuvent « signaler » le comportement d’un Utilisateur, notamment en utilisant la fonctionnalité prévue à cet effet sur le profil de l’Utilisateur ou en cliquant sur le « Pouce Rouge » à la fin d’une partie. Ces outils permettent à BGA d’appliquer, par une décision automatisée, une sanction à l’Utilisateur concerné.

Dans ce cadre, l’Utilisateur concerné reçoit un courrier électronique l'informant de la sanction qui a été prise par BGA à son encontre.

Conformément à la Politique de Modération de BGA, les Utilisateurs ont le droit de faire appel de la décision de modération qui leur a été appliquée en Nous contactant via le formulaire de Support”.

Lorsque Vous jouez à des Applications impliquant plusieurs Utilisateurs, notez que certaines Données Personnelles seront rendues publiques et donc accessibles aux autres Utilisateurs, telles que votre Nom d’Utilisateur, vos données de statistiques et performances de jeu. Les données des Contenus publiés dans le cadre de chats et forums pourront également être rendues publiques aux Utilisateurs et Internautes.

#### 5\. Avec qui partageons-Nous vos Données Personnelles ?

| Destinataires internes | Destinataires externes |
| --- | --- |

Veuillez noter que cette liste est non exhaustive et qu'il peut y avoir d'autres cas où Nous partageons vos données avec des tiers, lorsque cela est dans l'intérêt légitime de BGA, permis par la loi applicable, ou encore lorsque cela est nécessaire au respect d’une obligation légale à laquelle Nous sommes soumis.

Nous pouvons être amenés à partager vos Données Personnelles avec différentes catégories de tiers, selon nos besoins :

1\. Filiales dont la liste est disponible en [cliquant ici](https://cdn.svc.asmodee.net/corporate/uploads/Templates/Asmodee_group_companies_FR.pdf),

#### 6\. Combien de temps conservons-Nous vos Données Personnelles ?

Vos Données Personnelles sont, par principe, conservées uniquement le temps nécessaire pour la réalisation des finalités pour lesquelles elles ont été collectées.

Ainsi, lors de la création de votre Compte, vos données d’identification, vos données relatives à votre vie personnelle et les données du profil sont conservées, en base dite active, jusqu’à la suppression de votre Compte. Les données relatives au comportement et la réputation des Utilisateurs sont conservées en base dite active, jusqu’à la suppression du Compte.

Dans ces derniers cas, vos Données Personnelles seront archivées et conservées pour une durée de cinq (5) années à compter de votre dernière connexion, conformément au délai commun de prescription.

Les données statistiques des Applications (historique des parties jouées sur les Applications, préférences de vos Applications, les progrès dans les Applications, le temps de jeu sur les Applications), sont conservées en base dite active, jusqu’à la suppression de votre Compte.

Cependant dans certains cas, Vos Données Personnelles ne peuvent pas être complètement effacées afin d'assurer la cohérence de l'expérience des Utilisateurs les Sites BGA. Par exemple, les parties des Applications que Vous avez jouées et qui affectent les données et les scores des autres Utilisateurs ne seront pas supprimées. Dans ce cas, Vos Données Personnelles seront conservées dix (10) ans à compter de Votre dernière connexion puis anonymisées.

Les données de connexion (temps et lieu de vos activités, identifiant et adresse IP) sont conservées pour une durée d’un (1) an, en base active, à compter de votre dernière connexion. Vos autres adresses IP sont également conservées pour une durée de 30 jours, en base active.

Les données de Contenus communiqués sur les Applications (notamment à travers les chats) sont conservées pour une durée de trois (3) mois, en base active, à compter de leur date d’envoi. Les messages privés sont conservés jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient expressément supprimés.

Toutefois, conformément à nos Conditions Générales de Services, les données des Contenus que Vous publiez sur les forums des Sites BGA persistent même après la suppression de votre Compte et/ou de vos Données Personnelles, étant entendu que les Contenus demeureront associés à son Nom d’Utilisateur et/ou son avatar. Vous pouvez à tout moment demander la suppression spécifique de Contenus qui porteraient atteinte à vos droits dans les conditions de l’article 8 de la présente Politique de confidentialité.

En outre, Nous pouvons conserver certaines de vos données pour une durée plus importante, notamment lorsque Nous y sommes tenus au titre d’une obligation légale ou encore lorsque ces données sont nécessaires pour établir la preuve d’un droit ou d’un contrat. C’est le cas notamment de vos données liées aux transactions), montant des transactions que Vous avez réalisées ainsi que date et heure de ces transactions).

Dans ce cas, vos Données Personnelles seront archivées et conservées pour une durée de dix (10) années conformément au délai légal de prescription et/ou conformément à nos obligations fiscales et comptables.

Dès lors que les délais de conservation auront expiré, Nous veillerons à ce que vos Données Personnelles soient anonymisées ou supprimées.

#### 7\. Sécurité de vos Données Personnelles

Nous nous engageons à assurer la sécurité de vos Données Personnelles et Nous avons mis en place des politiques de sécurité des systèmes d’information et des règles et mesures techniques appropriées pour les protéger contre les accès, les modifications, l’utilisation et la divulgation non autorisées, la destruction illicite ou la perte accidentelle de ces données.

Tous nos salariés, consultants, Filiales et sous-traitants, qui ont accès à Vos Données Personnelles et sont associés à leur traitement, sont tenus d’en respecter la confidentialité.

• Sécurité de votre mot de passe

Nous prenons toutes les précautions utiles pour assurer le stockage sécurisé de votre mot de passe associé à votre Compte. Toutefois, la sécurité de ce mot de passe dépend aussi de sa conception. Aussi, Nous Vous rappelons que votre mot de passe, pour être valide doit être composé, a minima de 8 caractères, au moins 3 des 4 types suivants : majuscules, minuscules, chiffres, caractères spéciaux La Cnil recommande de créer des mots de passe complexes, tels que : ◦ Ne conserver que les premières lettres des mots d’une phrase ; par exemple, la phrase « Un Mot de Passe se retient ! » correspond au mot de passe "1mdp@sr !" ◦ En mettant une majuscule si le mot est un nom ◦ En gardant des signes de ponctuation (ex : !) ◦ En exprimant les nombres à l’aide des chiffres de 0 à 9 (ex : Un ->1)

• Sécurité des transactions

Conformément aux CG, le Site Joueur utilise la technologie des sociétés tierces pour sécuriser les transactions bancaires des Utilisateurs.

Ainsi, lors du paiement sur le Site Joueur, les coordonnées bancaires des Utilisateurs sont transmises de manière chiffrée aux prestataires tiers sans que BGA ne soit en mesure d’y accéder et d’en prendre connaissance d’une quelconque manière que ce soit.

BGA ne collecte donc ni le numéro de la carte bancaire de l’Utilisateur, ni son cryptogramme, ni toute autre information de nature bancaire.

Ainsi, pour exercer ses droits tels que ceux identifiés à l’article 8, relatifs à ses coordonnées de carte bancaire, l’Utilisateur est donc invité à s’adresser directement aux sociétés de paiement le cas échéant.

#### 1\. What is a cookie?

A "cookie" is a string of information that is usually small. It is identified by a name and can be transmitted to your browser by a website that you connect to. Your web browser will keep it for a period of time and return it to the webserver each time you reconnect to it.

There are different types of cookies:

• **Temporary cookies and permanent cookies**: temporary cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your browser session. Permanent cookies stay on your device for longer, for a time that is specific to each cookie, and remain valid until their expiry date (unless they are deleted before by the user).

• **Proprietary cookies and third-party cookies**: proprietary cookies are cookies that are installed by the Site domain (these cookies are installed by us). Third-party cookies are cookies that are placed on the user's computer by the server of a domain other than the Site domain (for example, it may be social network cookies or cookies from publishers of audience measurement solutions).

No cookie will be installed on your device without your prior consent, except for some cookies that are used uniquely to enable or facilitate electronic communications, or that are strictly required to provide an online communications service at your express request.

#### 2\. What cookies do we use, for what purposes and how can they be controlled?

The table below lists the different types of cookies used on the Site, along with their purpose(s) and lifetime.

##### a. Functional cookies

This information allows us to improve the interest, the ergonomics and the functioning of the services offered on the site (for example, the pages most often consulted, searches by Internet users in the site's engine, etc.). In order to comply with the regulations in force, the necessary measures have been taken to force the use of a secure exchange protocol (HTTPS) and to anonymise the IP addresses transiting through Google Analytics, thus making it impossible to pinpoint your precise geolocation via your IP address. These provisions allow us to measure the frequentation while preserving the anonymity of the collected data.

#### 1\. Qu’est-ce qu’un cookie ?

Un « cookie » est une suite d'informations, généralement de petite taille et identifié par un nom, qui peut être transmis à votre navigateur par un site web sur lequel vous vous connectez. Votre navigateur web le conservera pendant une certaine durée, et le renverra au serveur web chaque fois que vous vous y reconnecterez.

Il existe différents types de cookies :

• **Cookies temporaires et cookies permanents** : les cookies temporaires sont automatiquement supprimés à la fin de votre session de navigation. Les cookies permanents restent plus longtemps sur votre appareil, pendant la durée spécifique à chaque cookie, et restent valables jusqu’à leur date d’expiration (à moins qu’ils ne soient supprimés par l’utilisateur avant).

• **Cookies propriétaires et cookies tiers** : les cookies propriétaires sont les cookies installés par le domaine du Site (ces cookies sont ceux installés par AD2G). Les cookies tiers sont ceux placés sur l’ordinateur de l’internaute par le serveur d’un domaine distinct de celui du Site (il peut s’agir par exemple de cookies de réseaux sociaux ou d’éditeurs de solutions de mesure d’audience).

En l’occurrence, les cookies installés sur votre terminal ne nécessitent pas votre consentement préalable. En effet, ils ont pour finalité exclusive de permettre ou faciliter la communication par voie électronique, ou sont strictement nécessaires à la fourniture d'un service de communication en ligne à votre demande expresse.

En cas de manquement à l'une ou l'autre de ces obligations, sans que cette liste ne soit limitative, l’Internaute est informé que BGA aura la faculté de lui refuser ou lui suspendre, unilatéralement et sans notification préalable, l'accès à tout ou partie des Services et/ou des Sites BGA et à suspendre, le cas échéant, l’accès à son Compte.

L’Utilisateur garantit et indemnise BGA, ainsi que les Filiales, leurs représentants, leurs salariés, leurs partenaires, et/ou tous tiers, contre tout dommage, plainte ou demande émanant de tiers suite une utilisation ne respectant pas les présentes C.G.U. Cette garantie couvre les indemnités qui seraient éventuellement dues ainsi que les honoraires d'avocats et frais de justice dans une limite raisonnable.

L’Internaute accepte et reconnaît que BGA ne peut notamment garantir :

• que les contenus des Sites BGA mais également les Contenus sont conformes à ses attentes et à ses recherches ;

• la véracité, la complétude, la conformité et/ou l’adéquation des Contenus qui sont diffusés par les Utilisateurs sur les Sites BGA sous leur responsabilité et hébergés par BGA ;

• la qualité des interactions avec les autres Internautes et/ou Utilisateurs, ni même de la rapidité avec laquelle elles lui sont apportées par ces derniers ;

• et plus généralement aux besoins particuliers de l’Internaute.

BGA est également un tiers aux correspondances et relations entre les Utilisateurs et les Internautes et/ou Utilisateurs, et exclut de ce fait toute responsabilité à cet égard.

Aussi, l’Internaute accepte sans réserve que si la responsabilité de BGA devait être engagée directement ou indirectement en sa qualité d'intermédiaire technique, par quelque personne ou entité que ce soit, BGA se réserve le droit de prendre, promptement et de plein droit, toute mesure administrative et/ou technique, en ce compris à l’égard de l’Internaute permettant de sauvegarder ses intérêts et/ou de se conformer aux obligations qui lui incombent.

##### B. Garanties de BGA

BGA met à la disposition de l’Internaute, au travers de ses Sites BGA, l'accès à un certain nombre de Services visant à l'accompagner dans le cadre de ses interactions avec les Utilisateurs.

BGA ne garantit pas la pérennité du Contenu que l’Utilisateur publie sur les Services, et/ou des Applications qui peut/peuvent disparaître pour n'importe quelle raison. C'est pourquoi l’Utilisateur doit faire lui-même ses propres sauvegardes des Contenus. L'accès au Site Joueur, aux Applications et aux Services requiert une connexion Internet dont l’Utilisateur assure complètement la charge et la responsabilité.

BGA n’intervient pas dans les relations, en particulier juridiques, entre les Internautes et les Utilisateurs ou entre les Utilisateurs eux-mêmes. Ils leur incombent donc de réaliser les vérifications d’usage, notamment d’ordre légal, avant de conclure tout accord avec un Utilisateur qui n’engage qu’eux.

En toute hypothèse, BGA ne garantit pas :

• la mise à jour permanente des Services, des Sites BGA et des Applications ;

• l’absence d’interruption des fonctionnalités des Services, de la présence de virus ou tout autre composant nuisible dans les Services ou les serveurs qui les font fonctionner et que les défauts dans le fonctionnement ou les fonctionnalités du Site Joueur, des Applications et des Services seront corrigés ;

• que l'utilisation des Sites BGA, des Applications et des Services répondra à ses besoins ;

• que toute information que l’Utilisateur aura obtenue en utilisant les Sites BGA, les Applications et/ou les Services (s) sera exacte ou fiable.

Les Services, les Sites BGA et les Applications sont fournis en l'état et BGA n'accorde aucune garantie à cet égard.

L’Internaute reconnait être seul responsable des dommages causés à BGA et/ou aux autres Utilisateurs ou à toute personne physique ou morale tierce, le cas-échéant, du fait d’une utilisation des Services et/ou des Sites BGA et/ou des Applications.

Dans cette hypothèse BGA se réserve le droit de supprimer son Compte, ainsi que d’agir en justice sur les fondements de la responsabilité civile et/ou pénale pour mettre fin à la violation et réparer son préjudice.

#### VIII. Fair-Play

BGA ne tolérera aucune tricherie et/ou aucun manque de fair-play, que ce soit par l’utilisation de logiciels de triche, l’analyse des protocoles de communication ou du code, l’utilisation de plusieurs Comptes, la complicité d’autres Utilisateurs, toute sortie du jeu avant sa fin normale, l’utilisation de tactiques de blocage du jeu dans le but de forcer les autres Utilisateurs à abandonner ou l’utilisation d’un langage obscène ou grossier, etc.

Tout Utilisateur pris à tricher ou à manquer à ses obligations de fair-play recevra un avertissement, puis sera passible de l’une des sanctions suivantes à la discrétion de BGA :

◦ gel du Compte,

◦ remise à zéro de ses scores et classements,

◦ suspension des Services,

◦ voire de la suppression pure et simple de son Compte.

L’atteinte par l’Utilisateur aux règles de conduite ou aux règles essentielles du fair play peuvent avoir des conséquences sur sa réputation sur le Site Joueur, dans les conditions et modalités précisées dans la Politique de confidentialité.

#### IX. Publicité

BGA se réserve la possibilité de diffuser des messages publicitaires ou promotionnels sur les Sites BGA, en ce compris dans le cadre des Services.

#### X. Limitation de responsabilité

BGA n’est responsable que des dommages directs causés par les Services, sauf en cas de fraude, de faute lourde ou intentionnelle, de force majeure, de décès ou dommage corporel et toute autre exclusion prévue par des dispositions législatives et réglementaires d’ordre public.

BGA ne saurait être responsable de :

• tout dommage indirect qui pourrait être causé à l’Internaute, y compris toute perte de profit (qu'elle soit directe ou indirecte), toute perte de chance ou de réputation qu’il pourrait subir ;

• dans le cadre d’une procédure introduite à l’encontre résultant de l’utilisation non-conforme des Services et/ou des Sites BGA et/ou des Applications par l’Internaute. L’Internaute reconnait et accepte à cet égard que l’Internaute fera son affaire personnelle de toute réclamation ou procédure formée contre BGA, du fait de l’utilisation non-conforme par lui des Services et/ou du Site Joueur et/ou des Applications.

• toute perte ou tout dommage que l’Internaute pourrit subir du fait de :

◦ l'inexactitude, l’illicéité, ou l’inadéquation des Contenus fournis par l’Internaute ou en cas de dommages consécutifs à l'utilisation d’un Contenu fourni par un Utilisateur tiers ;

◦ la confiance accordée à l'exhaustivité, l'exactitude ou l'existence de toute publicité ou résultant de toute relation ou transaction entre l’Internaute et l'un quelconque des annonceurs ou sponsors dont la publicité figure sur le Site Joueur et/ou sur les Applications ;

◦ tout changement que BGA pourrait apporter aux Sites BGA et/ou aux Applications et /ou aux Services ou toute suppression temporaire ou définitive d’un ou plusieurs Services ;

◦ la suppression, l’endommagement ou le défaut de stockage du Contenu et de toute autre donnée de communication conservée ou transmise dans le cadre des Services ;

◦ en cas d'indisponibilité des Services et/ou des Sites BGA et/ou des Applications pour des raisons telles que la défaillance du réseau public d'électricité, la défaillance des réseaux câblés de télécommunications, la perte de connectivité au réseau Internet due aux opérateurs publics ou privés, notamment de l’Utilisateur, dont les causes proviennent notamment de grèves, de tempêtes, de tremblements de terre ou de toute autre cause ayant les caractéristiques de la force majeure ;

◦ en cas d’utilisation des Services par un Utilisateur dans des conditions non-conformes aux C.G.U. et/ou aux C.G.S. Joueurs et/ou aux C.G.S. Développeurs ;

◦ le défaut de communication par l’Internaute à BGA des Données d’Identification ;

◦ l’incapacité de l’Internaute à conserver en toute sécurité et confidentialité ses Données d’Identification ou les informations de son Compte ;

◦ de non-respect de la législation d’un pays étranger où l’utilisation des Services et/ou les Applications et/ou le Site Joueur serait réalisé.

Les limitations de responsabilité de BGA à l’égard de l’Internaute s'appliqueront, que BGA ait été averti ou non de l'éventualité de la survenance de telles pertes et qu'il ait dû en avoir ou non connaissance.

#### XI. Contenu illicite

L’Utilisateur reconnait que BGA, en sa qualité d’hébergeur, au sens des dispositions de l’article 6-I-7 de la Loi n°2004-575 du 21 juin 2004, des Contenus que l’Utilisateur publie, n’exerce pas de contrôle a priori sur lesdits Contenus transmis via les Services et n’a pas d’obligation générale de surveillance des Contenus publiés.

N’ayant donc que le rôle d’hébergeur desdits Contenus diffusés sous la responsabilité exclusive des Utilisateurs, BGA ne peut donc intervenir sur les Contenus publiés dans le cadre des Services que dans le cas où un Contenu manifestement illicite lui serait signalé par un Utilisateur.

L’Utilisateur peut contacter BGA dont les coordonnées sont disponibles en [cliquant ici](https://boardgamearena.com/legal?section=legal) pour le Site Joueur ou depuis un bouton dédié sur le Site « signaler ce Joueur ».

BGA se réservera le droit d’agir à son entière discrétion : à ce titre, BGA peut notamment demander l’arrêt de l’utilisation du Contenu et/ou retirer le Contenu des Services.

Si BGA supprime ou désactive un Contenu crée par un Utilisateur et qui est considéré comme étant manifestement illicite ou non conforme aux présentes aux C.G.U. et/ou aux C.G.S. Joueurs et/ou aux C.G.S. Développeurs, BGA se réserve le droit de suspendre ou de supprimer le Compte de l’Utilisateur.

Enfin, l’Utilisateur reconnaît et accepte que le fait, pour lui, de présenter un Contenu diffusé par un Utilisateur comme étant illicite dans le seul but d’en obtenir le retrait ou d’en faire cesser la diffusion, alors qu’il est conscient que cette information est inexacte, peut être poursuivi pénalement.

#### XII. Force majeure

La responsabilité de BGA ne pourra pas être recherchée si l'exécution de l'une de ses obligations est empêchée ou retardée en raison d'un cas de force majeure tel que définie à l’article 1218 du code civil et par la jurisprudence des Tribunaux français, et notamment les catastrophes naturelles, incendies, dysfonctionnement ou interruption du réseau de télécommunications ou du réseau électrique.

#### XIII. Propriété intellectuelle

La technique du "framing" qui consiste notamment à afficher en incrustation sur la page d’un site internet celle d’un autre site internet, est interdite en ce qui concerne les Sites BGA, sauf autorisation expresse et préalable de BGA.

##### A. Droits d’auteur sur les Sites BGA

BGA est le titulaire ou le concessionnaire des droits de propriété intellectuelle tant de la structure générale des Sites BGA que leur contenu (textes, slogans, graphiques, images, vidéos, photos, programmes et autres contenus), à l’exclusion de tout Contenu publié par l’Utilisateur. Dès lors, sans préjudice des dispositions de l’article XIII D, toute représentation, reproduction, modification, dénaturation et/ou exploitation totale ou partielle des Sites BGA et/ou des Services, par quelque procédé que ce soit et sur quelque support que ce soit, sans l’autorisation expresse et préalable de BGA, est prohibée et constitue des actes de contrefaçon de droits d’auteur.

About \`re-using\`: we are obviously happy when you share your experience on BGA on medias :) The previous statement is more about re-using pieces of BGA for another service.

De même, toute exploitation non autorisée des Sites BGA et/ou des Services engage la responsabilité pénale et civile de l’Internaute sur le fondement de la contrefaçon de droits d’auteur.

L’Internaute reconnaît et accepte que l’accès aux Sites BGA et/ou aux Services mis à disposition par BGA ne saurait emporter quelconque cession ou concession des droits de propriété intellectuelle (droits d’auteurs notamment) et autres droits de la personnalité (droit à l’image, au respect de la vie privée) au bénéfice de l’Internaute.

L’accès aux Sites BGA et aux Services est exclusivement limité à l’usage privé et personnel de l’Internaute dans les conditions et limites définies dans les présentes C.G.U.

##### B. Signes distinctifs

Les marques, logos, dénominations sociales, sigles, noms commerciaux, enseignes et/ou nom de domaine de BGA et/ou de ses partenaires mentionnés sur les Sites BGA, permettant l’accès aux Services mis à disposition par BGA, constituent des signes distinctifs insusceptibles d’utilisation sans l’autorisation expresse et préalable de leur titulaire.

Toute représentation et/ou reproduction et/ou exploitation partielle ou totale de ces signes distinctifs est donc prohibée et constitutif de contrefaçon de marque, d’usurpation de dénomination sociale, nom commercial et de nom de domaine engageant la responsabilité civile délictuelle de son auteur.

##### C. Publicité et liens hypertexte

Les liens hypertextes accessibles sur les Sites BGA et/ou dans le cadre des Services, en direction d’autres sites Internet et d’une manière générale vers toutes ressources existantes sur Internet ne sauraient engager la responsabilité de BGA.

L’Internaute ne pourra en aucun cas permettre ou utiliser des liens hypertextes à destination de pages profondes des Sites BGA, permettant l’accès aux Services et ce, par quelconque procédé technique destiné à passer outre le champ d’identification de l’Internaute ou à procéder à l’aspiration de tout ou partie du contenu des Services mis à disposition par BGA.

Les Services, les Applications et les Sites BGA et le cas échéant le Contenu peuvent contenir des hyperliens pointant vers d'autres sites Internet qui n'appartiennent pas à BGA. BGA n'exerce aucun contrôle sur les contenus, les conditions particulières de chaque offre de tiers de même que les conditions générales de vente, d’utilisation et les chartes de protection des données personnelles ou les pratiques des sites tiers et décline toute responsabilité à cet égard.

L’Internaute reconnait et accepte que BGA n'est pas responsable de la disponibilité de ces sites et ressources externes et ne cautionne ni la publicité, ni les produits ou autres liens ou données figurant sur ces sites Internet ou ressources externes, ou accessibles depuis ceux-ci.

L’Internaute reconnait et accepte que BGA ne peut être tenu responsable des pertes ou dommages que l’Internaute pourrait subir du fait de l’existence de ces sites ou ressources externes ou du fait de la confiance qu’il accorde quant à l'exhaustivité, l'exactitude ou l'existence de toute publicité, tout produit ou autres données sur ces sites Internet ou ressources externes, ou accessibles depuis ceux-ci.

Dans l’hypothèse où, selon l’Internaute, une offre de tiers référencée renfermerait des contenus illicites ou inappropriés, il peut le signaler à BGA dont les coordonnées sont disponibles en [cliquant ici](https://boardgamearena.com/support) pour le Site Joueur.

##### D. Bases de données

Dès lors, conformément aux dispositions de l'article L. 342-1 du même Code, l’Internaute s'interdit de procéder à :

• l'extraction par transfert permanent ou temporaire de la totalité ou d'une partie qualitativement ou quantitativement substantielle du contenu d'une ou plusieurs des bases des données accessibles sur les Sites BGA et/ou les Applications et/ou les Services, en ce compris la structure et/ou l’ordonnancement des Contenus, sur un autre support, par tout moyen et sous toute forme que ce soit, en ce compris à des fins d'utilisation ou de consultation par un média et/ou un procédé(s) non autorisé(s) par BGA ;

##### E. Contenu des Services

About \`re-using\`: we are obviously happy when you share your experience on BGA on medias :) The previous statement is more about re-using pieces of BGA for another service.

The statement above is obviously not related to the competitions that are part of the BGA service offer, like tournaments.

In the event of a breach of any of these obligations, without this list being exhaustive, the Internet User is informed that BGA will have the right to deny or suspend, unilaterally and without prior notice, the Internet User's access to all or part of the Services and/or BGA Sites and to suspend, if necessary, access to their Account.

The User guarantees and shall hold BGA, as well as its Subsidiaries, their representatives, their employees, their partners, and/or any third parties, harmless against any damage, claim or demand from third parties as a result of use that does not comply with these G.T.U. This guarantee covers any compensation that may be due as well as lawyers' fees and legal costs within a reasonable limit.

The Internet User accepts and acknowledges that BGA cannot guarantee:

• that the contents of the BGA Sites, as well as the Content, are in conformity with their expectations and their research;

• the truthfulness, completeness, conformity and/or appropriateness of the Content published by Users on the BGA Sites under their responsibility and hosted by BGA;

• the quality of interactions with other Internet Users and/or Users, or even the speed with which they are brought to them by the latter;

• and more generally to the particular needs of the Internet User.

BGA is also a third party to the correspondence and relations between Users and Internet Users and/or Users, and therefore declines any liability in this respect.

Therefore, the Internet User accepts without reservation that if BGA's liability were to be incurred directly or indirectly in its capacity as technical intermediary, by any person or entity whatsoever, BGA reserves the right to take, promptly and as of right, any administrative and/or technical measure, including with regard to the Internet User, to safeguard its interests and/or comply with its obligations.

##### B. Guarantees of BGA

BGA provides the Internet User, through its BGA Sites, with access to a certain number of Services designed to assist them in their interactions with Users.

BGA does not guarantee the continuity of the Content that the User publishes on the Services, and/or of the Applications which may disappear for any reason. Therefore, the User must make their own backups of the Content. Access to the Player Site, the Applications and the Services requires an Internet connection for which the User is fully responsible.

BGA does not intervene in the relations, in particular legal relations, between Internet Users and Users or between Users themselves. They are therefore responsible for carrying out the usual checks, particularly of a legal nature, before entering into any agreement with a User which is only binding on them.

In any case, BGA does not guarantee:

• the permanent updating of the Services, the BGA Sites and the Applications;

• that the functionality of the Services will not be interrupted, that there are no viruses or other harmful components in the Services or the servers that run them and that defects in the operation or functionality of the Player Site, the Applications and the Services will be corrected;

• that the use of the BGA Sites, Applications and Services will meet their needs;

• that any information obtained by the User through the use of the BGA Sites, the Applications and/or the Service(s) is accurate or reliable.

The Services, the BGA Sites and the Applications are provided "as is" and BGA makes no warranties in this regard.

The Internet User acknowledges that they alone is responsible for any damage caused to BGA and/or other Users or to any third party, whether natural or legal, as a result of using the Services and/or the BGA Sites and/or the Applications.

In this case, BGA reserves the right to delete their Account, as well as to take legal action on the basis of civil and/or criminal liability in order to put an end to the violation and to compensate for its damage.

#### VIII. Fair Play

BGA will not tolerate any cheating and/or lack of fair play, whether through the use of cheating software, analysis of communication protocols or code, use of multiple Accounts, collusion with other Users, leaving the game before its normal end, use of game blocking tactics in order to force other Users to quit, or the use of obscene or foul language, etc.

Any User caught cheating or failing to meet their fair play obligations will receive a warning and then be subject to one of the following sanctions at the discretion of BGA:

◦ freezing of the Account,

◦ resetting of scores and rankings,

◦ suspension of Services,

◦ or even the outright deletion of their Account.

Violation by the User of the rules of conduct or the essential rules of fair play may have consequences for the User's reputation on the Player Site, under the terms and conditions specified in the Privacy Policy.

#### IX. Advertising

BGA reserves the right to broadcast advertising or promotional messages on the BGA Sites, including in the context of the Services.

#### X. Limitation of liability

BGA is only liable for direct damage caused by the Services, except in the case of fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, force majeure, death or bodily injury and any other exclusion provided for by public policy legal and regulatory provisions.

BGA shall not be liable for:

• any indirect damage that may be caused to the Internet User, including any loss of profit (whether direct or indirect), loss of opportunity or loss of reputation that they may suffer;

• in the context of proceedings brought against the Internet User as a result of non-compliant use of the Services and/or the BGA Sites and/or the Applications. The Internet user acknowledges and accepts in this respect that they shall be personally responsible for any claim or proceedings brought against BGA as a result of their non-compliant use of the Services and/or the Player Site and/or the Applications.

• any loss or damage that the Internet User may suffer as a result of:

◦ the inaccuracy, illegality or inadequacy of the Content provided by the Internet User or in the event of damage resulting from the use of the Content provided by a third party User;

◦ reliance on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertisement or resulting from any relationship or transaction between the Internet User and any of the advertisers or sponsors whose advertising appears on the Player Site and/or the Applications;

◦ any changes that BGA may make to the BGA Sites and/or Applications and/or Services or any temporary or permanent withdrawal of one or more Services;

◦ the deletion, damage or failure to store Content and any other communications data maintained or transmitted as part of the Services;

◦ in the event of unavailability of the Services and/or BGA Sites and/or Applications for reasons such as the failure of the public electricity network, the failure of the cable telecommunications networks, the loss of connectivity to the Internet network due to public or private operators, including the User, caused in particular by strikes, storms, earthquakes or any other cause having the characteristics of force majeure;

◦ in the event of use of the Services by a User under conditions that do not comply with the G.T.U. and/or Player G.T.S. and/or Developer G.T.S.;

◦ the failure of the Internet User to communicate Identification Data;

◦ the inability of the Internet User to keep their Identification Data or their Account information secure and confidential;

◦ non-compliance with the legislation of a foreign country where the Services and/or the Applications and/or the Player Site are used.

The limitations of BGA's liability towards the Internet user will apply, whether or not BGA has been warned of the possibility of such losses and whether or not it should have been aware of them.

#### XI. Illegal content

The User acknowledges that BGA, in its capacity as host, within the meaning of the provisions of Article 6-I-7 of Law No. 2004-575 of 21 June 2004, of the Content that the User publishes, does not exercise any a priori control on said Content transmitted via the Services and has no general obligation to monitor the Content published.

Having therefore only the role of host of said Contents disseminated under the exclusive responsibility of Users, BGA can only intervene on Content published within the framework of the Services in the event that clearly illegal Content is reported to it by a User.

The User may contact BGA whose contact details are available by [clicking here](https://boardgamearena.com/support) for the Player Site or from a dedicated "report this Player" button on the Site.

BGA reserves the right to act at its sole discretion: as such, BGA may, in particular, request that the use of the Content be stopped and/or remove the Content from the Services.

If BGA deletes or deactivates Content created by a User and which is considered to be manifestly illegal or not in conformity with the G.T.U. and/or Player G.T.S. and/or Developer G.T.S., BGA reserves the right to suspend or delete the User's Account.

Finally, the User acknowledges and accepts that presenting Content disseminated by a User as illegal with the sole aim of obtaining its removal or stopping its dissemination, when the User is aware that this information is inaccurate, may be prosecuted.

#### XII. Force majeure

BGA cannot be held liable if the performance of one of its obligations is prevented or delayed due to a case of force majeure as defined in Article 1218 of the Civil Code and by the case law of the French Courts, and in particular natural disasters, fires, malfunction or interruption of the telecommunications network or the electricity network.

#### XIII. Intellectual property

The technique of "framing" which consists in particular in embedding on the page of a website that of another website, is prohibited with regard to the BGA Sites, except with the express prior authorisation of BGA.

##### A. Copyright on BGA Sites

BGA is the owner or licensee of the intellectual property rights of both the general structure of the BGA Sites and their content (texts, slogans, graphics, images, videos, photos, programs and other content), excluding any Content published by the User. Therefore, without prejudice to the provisions of Article XIII D, any representation, reproduction, modification, distortion and/or exploitation of all or part of the BGA Sites and/or Services, by any process whatsoever and on any medium whatsoever, without the express prior authorisation of BGA, is prohibited and constitutes an infringement of copyright.

About \`re-using\`: we are obviously happy when you share your experience on BGA on medias :) The previous statement is more about re-using pieces of BGA for another service.

Likewise, any unauthorised use of the BGA Sites and/or Services shall render the Internet user criminally and civilly liable on the basis of copyright infringement.

The Internet user acknowledges and accepts that access to the BGA Sites and/or the Services made available by BGA does not imply any assignment or grant of intellectual property rights (in particular copyright) and other personal rights (image rights, privacy) to the Internet user.

Access to the BGA Sites and Services is exclusively limited to the private and personal use of the Internet user under the conditions and within the limits defined in these G.T.U.

##### B. Distinctive signs

The trademarks, logos, corporate names, acronyms, commercial names, signs and/or domain names of BGA and/or its partners mentioned on the BGA Sites, allowing access to the Services made available by BGA, constitute distinctive signs that cannot be used without the express prior authorisation of their owner.

Any partial or total representation and/or reproduction and/or exploitation of these distinctive signs is prohibited and constitutes trademark infringement, usurpation of a corporate name, trade name and domain name incurring the tort liability of the perpetrator.

##### C. Advertising and hyperlinks

BGA cannot be held liable for the hyperlinks accessible on the BGA Sites and/or within the framework of the Services, to other websites and generally to all existing resources on the Internet.

Under no circumstances may the Internet User allow or use hyperlinks to deep pages of the BGA Sites, allowing access to the Services, by any technical means intended to bypass the Internet User's identification field or to extract all or part of the content of the Services made available by BGA.

The Services, the Applications and the BGA Sites and, where applicable, the Content may contain hyperlinks to other websites that do not belong to BGA. BGA has no control over the content, the special conditions of each third party offer as well as the general terms and conditions of sale, use and privacy policies or practices of third party sites and accepts no responsibility in this respect.

The Internet User acknowledges and accepts that BGA is not responsible for the availability of these external sites and resources and does not endorse any advertising, products or other links or data on or available from them.

The Internet User acknowledges and accepts that BGA cannot be held responsible for any loss or damage that the Internet User may suffer as a result of the existence of these external sites or resources or as a result of their reliance on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other data on or accessible from them.

In the event that, in the opinion of the Internet user, a listed third party offer contains illegal or inappropriate content, they may report this to BGA, whose contact details are available by [clicking here](https://boardgamearena.com/support) for the Player Site.

##### D. Database

The Internet User irrevocably acknowledges that the BGA Sites and Services, including the structure and/or layout of the Content and/or Applications, consist of one or more databases made available to Internet Users by BGA in its capacity as producer of said databases within the meaning of Articles L.341-1 et seq. of the Intellectual Property Code.

Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 342-1 of the same Code, the Internet User is prohibited from proceeding with:

• the extraction by permanent or temporary transfer of all or a qualitatively or quantitatively substantial part of the content of one or more of the databases accessible on the BGA Sites and/or the Applications and/or the Services, including the structure and/or layout of Content, onto another medium, by any means and in any form whatsoever, including for the purpose of use or consultation by a medium and/or process(es) not authorised by BGA;

• the re-use, by making available to the public all or a qualitatively or quantitatively substantial part of the content of one or more of the databases accessible on the BGA Sites and/or Services, including the structure and/or layout of the Content and/or Applications, in any form whatsoever, including by means of a hyperlink, a medium and/or process(es) not authorised by BGA;

• the creation, publication, maintenance, updating, importing, exporting, making available to third parties, whether free of charge or against payment, and participation in the aforementioned acts, of a competing database derived from all or part of one or more of the BGA databases;

• viewing on a screen by a process or media other than those by which BGA intends to disclose the BGA Sites and the Services, the Applications, including the structure and/or layout of the Content and/or the Applications;

• in general, any extraction, use, storage, reproduction, representation or conservation, direct or indirect, partial or total, including in buffer or temporary memory, qualitatively or quantitatively substantial of the content of one or more of BGA's databases, committed by one of the processes mentioned above, is strictly prohibited, including by a medium not authorised by BGA

##### E. Content of Services

The Internet User acknowledges and accepts that access to the BGA Sites and the Services made available by BGA does not imply any assignment or grant of intellectual property rights (in particular copyright) and other rights to the Internet User. The Internet User acknowledges and accepts that the private and personal use granted by BGA for access to its Services excludes, in particular, access to the Services with a view to collective use of its content, reproduction, representation, resale, exchange, rental, transfer to a third party, modification, adaptation and correction, whether free of charge or against payment, of all or part of the BGA Sites, Services and their content.

#### XIV. Protection of Personal Data

Pursuant to Articles 1366 et seq. of the Civil Code, the User acknowledges and accepts that the information provided by BGA by email and on the BGA Sites is authentic between the Internet User and BGA. Elements such as the time of reception or transmission, as well as the quality of the data received, will be deemed authentic by priority as they appear on the BGA Sites, or as they are authenticated by BGA's computerised procedures, unless the Internet User provides written proof to the contrary. The scope of proof of the information provided by the BGA Sites and/or the Applications and the computerised procedures of BGA is that granted to an original in the sense of a written paper document, signed by hand.

##### C. Non-waiver.

The Internet User acknowledges that if BGA does not exercise or assert any right or remedy provided for in these G.T.U. (or from which BGA may benefit under any applicable law), this does not constitute a formal waiver by BGA of its rights, and these rights and remedies shall remain valid and enforceable for BGA.

##### D. Severability

If any of the terms of these G.T.U. are found to be invalid by any decision of a competent court, they shall be deleted without affecting the other terms of the G.T.U. The remaining terms shall remain valid and enforceable.

All complaints to BGA must be made in writing.

Failing an amicable settlement, the User may choose:

1) To resort to an amicable mediation solution within a maximum period of one (1) year from the date of the Internet User's written complaint to BGA:

(i) or by referring the matter to a consumer mediator with a view to amicably resolving the dispute. To this end, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with the mediation rules of the CMAP - Paris Mediation and Arbitration Centre - at the Paris Ile-de-France Chamber of Commerce and Industry;

(ii) or by using the online dispute resolution system accessible at the following address:https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage, it being specified that the proposed mediation process cannot be a prerequisite for a referral to the competent courts by the Internet User.

À réception de sa notification dûment justifiée, BGA adressera un courrier électronique à l’Utilisateur lui permettant de mettre à jour ses Éléments d’identification, à charge pour lui de les conserver strictement confidentiels.

Si BGA a des motifs légitimes de penser que la sécurité du Site Joueur et/ou de l’une/des Application(s) est violée et/ou qu’une mauvaise utilisation de tout ou partie des Services serait due à une utilisation non autorisée du Compte de l’Utilisateur, BGA pourra suspendre temporairement l’accès de l’Utilisateur à son Compte, et/ou à son Abonnement Premium et donc son accès aux Services, et ce, pour préserver l’intégrité du Site Joueur et/ou de l’une/des Application(s) et des données puis, si nécessaire, exiger de l’Utilisateur la modification de ses Éléments d’identification suivant ses instructions.

À ce titre, l’Utilisateur s’interdit de vendre, copier, échanger, transférer, publier, louer, concéder au titre d’une licence, distribuer, commercialiser ou exploiter commercialement l’Application, ou encore la décompiler, désassembler le code, le réduire en une forme lisible par l’homme ou attribuer ou distribuer quelque élément que ce soit que l’Utilisateur pourrait copier ou dériver de ladite Application.

Les Contenus sont diffusés sur les espaces de discussion (et plus généralement à l’aide des Services) sans limitation de durée et subsistent y compris si l’Utilisateur supprime son Compte.

Si l’Utilisateur supprime son Compte, celui-ci devient invisible sur le Site Joueur et/ou les Applications pour les autres Utilisateurs et n’est plus accessible. Les Contenus de l’Utilisateur persistent même après la suppression de son Compte, étant entendu que le Contenu demeurera associé à son Nom d’Utilisateur et/ou son avatar.

Chaque Utilisateur peut procéder à la réalisation de Traductions dans les conditions et modalités détaillées dans les C.G.S. Développeurs lesquelles prévoient expressément que l’ensemble des droits de propriété intellectuelle associés à ces Traductions seront automatiquement dévolus à BGA.

##### 3.1. Acceptance of the Player G.T.S.

These Player G.T.S. govern the rights, obligations and restrictions associated with the use of the Player Site and/or the Applications and/or the Services and/or the purchase of a Premium Subscription.

IF THE USER REFUSES THE TERMS OF THESE PLAYER G.T.S., THEY ARE INVITED NOT TO USE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE FROM THE PLAYER SITE OR ANY OF THE APPLICATIONS.

Access to the Player Site and/or the Applications and/or the use of all or part of the Services and Applications implies that the User accepts and undertakes to respect the Player G.T.S., the Privacy Policy, the G.T.U., any other disclaimer, and/or the other contractual conditions and the rules of the game, if any, applicable when using the Applications, without reservation.

##### 3.2. Modifications of the Player G.T.S.

BGA reserves the right to periodically modify these Player G.T.S., for example to adapt them to legislative and regulatory changes, or to modify the features offered on the Player Site and/or the Services and/or the Applications.

BGA will inform Users, as far as possible, within a maximum of fifteen (15) days before the entry into force of the amended Player G.T.S. Consequently, the User is invited to regularly consult these Developer Player G.T.S. If the User does not accept the amended Player G.T.S., they must stop using the Services. Continuing to use the Services beyond the date of publication of the amended Player G.T.S. will presume the User's acceptance of the amended Player G.T.S.

As these Player G.T.S. may be subject to modifications, the applicable conditions are those in force and accessible on the date of the User's access to the Player Site.

##### 3.3. Information and protection of minors

If the User is a minor and wishes to access the Player Site and make full use of all or part of the Services and/or Applications, they must read the Player G.T.S. and understand them with the help of their parents or legal guardians and obtain their consent to use said Services and/or Applications.

However, BGA recommends that parents or legal guardians monitor the activities of their children or children in their care when using the Services. BGA recommends that Users be vigilant that their children, or the children in their care, never disclose their Personal Data without the consent of the Users.

BGA reserves the right to restrict or prohibit access to the Services by children under the age of fifteen (15) if the prior consent of their parents or legal guardians has not been obtained.

Parents or legal guardians may close the minor's Account at any time by sending an email to BGA whose contact details are available by [clicking here](https://boardgamearena.com/legal?section=legal).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, use of the BGA Services must be carried out under parental supervision, and any use of the Services by a minor will be presumed to have been validated in advance by their parents or legal guardians.

Unless otherwise provided by law, BGA disclaims any liability for the use of the Services by minors without the consent of their parents or legal guardians.

#### 4\. Terms and conditions of subscription to the Services

##### 4.1. Creation of an Account

In order to access and/or use certain features and/or benefits of the Services, it is necessary to create an Account. To create an Account, the User must go to the Player Site and enter their Identification Data.

The User also has the possibility of linking their Third Party Account within the meaning of the G.T.U. with their Account so that they can directly access the Player Site without having to enter any other Identification Data.

Any connection to the Player Site, any of the Applications and/or the Services using a Third Party Account as defined in the G.T.U. is deemed to have been made with the Account in question. The processing of Personal Data relating to the linking of a Third Party Account to an Account is explained in the Privacy Policy.

Other Identification Data may be entered in the "About" section on the Player Site which will be public and therefore accessible to other Users.

The opening of an Account requires the creation of a Username, if necessary an avatar (visual identity linked to the Account and created by the User), and a password.

The Username is a unique element, and no two Users can have the same Username.

The User agrees that the Username may be publicly displayed as part of the Services in accordance with the Privacy Policy, and therefore the User is advised not to include their surname, which may optionally be publicly displayed in their Account information.

For other Identification Data that may be made public, the User is invited to refer to the Privacy Policy.

The Identification Details are strictly personal. The User undertakes to keep them confidential and not to pass them on to third parties. The User is the only person authorised to access and use the Services using their Account and their Identification Details.

Any access to the Services with the Account is automatically deemed to have been made by the User associated with it and under their responsibility.

Therefore, in the event of loss, theft or any fraudulent act with regard to the Identification Details, it is up to the User to inform BGA as soon as possible and to prove their identity by any means.

Upon receipt of a duly justified notification, BGA will send an email to the User allowing them to update their Identification Details, it being the User's responsibility to keep them strictly confidential.

If BGA has legitimate reason to believe that the security of the Player Site and/or the Application(s) is violated and/or that a misuse of all or part of the Services is due to unauthorised use of the User's Account, BGA may temporarily suspend the User's access to their Account and/or Premium Subscription and therefore their access to the Services, in order to preserve the integrity of the Player Site and/or the Application(s) and the data and, if necessary, require the User to modify their Identification Details according to its instructions.

Likewise, if the User selects a Username as part of the Identification Details enabling them to access their Account that is inappropriate, contrary to good morals or infringing on the rights of a third party, BGA reserves the right to suspend access to the Account concerned and/or to suspend the Premium Subscription in question.

##### 4.2. Veracity and use of Identification Data.

When creating an Account, the User undertakes to provide accurate and complete Identification Data and also undertakes to update this Identification Data in accordance with BGA's requests.

The User shall not allege or imply to be another person or entity by providing false information about a parent, legal guardian or any other person, including, without limitation, through the use of the Username, avatar or any other information such as an image.

BGA may take steps to verify the veracity of the information provided, if necessary, by telephone or by email entered to designate a parent or legal guardian. In order to prevent fraud, the User agrees to provide BGA with the necessary authorisations and evidence in accordance with the Privacy Policy upon request by email.

#### 5\. Use of the Applications

The Applications are made available to the User under a non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-commercial and personal licence, and exclusively for leisure and personal use.

The Applications remain the entire property of BGA and/or its Subsidiaries, in particular with regard to the intellectual property rights associated with them. Consequently, the licence granted does not constitute an assignment of the intellectual property rights of said Applications.

As such, the User shall not sell, copy, exchange, transfer, publish, rent, license, distribute, market or commercially exploit the Application, or decompile, disassemble the code, reduce it to a human readable form or attribute or distribute any element that the User may copy or derive from the Application.

The licence to use the Application shall remain in force for as long as the Application remains accessible on the Player Site. The User may not request a refund of any payment made because an Application is no longer accessible on the Player Site and/or its economic model changes (for example, an Application becomes a Premium Application and vice versa).

The User is informed that the Applications are only compatible with the Receiving Media within the meaning of the G.T.U. and all operating systems and that the performance of the Applications and the related Services may vary accordingly.

#### 6\. Rules of conduct

BGA hereby authorises the User to access and use the Player Site and/or the Applications and/or the Services, subject to compliance with the conditions set out in the G.T.U. and the User is informed that failure to comply with any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Player G.T.S.

#### 7\. Online discussion areas

The discussion areas, like the other Services, are moderated a posteriori, and do not allow Content to be checked before it is posted on the Applications.

When the User publishes Content in the discussion areas, their Username and/or avatar may appear. The User declares that they are aware of and accept that the disclosure and/or publication and/or dissemination of their messages is done under their own responsibility. The Content is disseminated on the discussion areas (and more generally using the Services) without any time limit and remains even if the User deletes their Account.

If the User deletes their Account, it becomes invisible on the Player Site and/or the Applications for other Users and is no longer accessible. The User's Content remains even after the deletion of their Account, it being understood that the Content will remain associated with their Username and/or avatar.

#### 8\. Translations

Each User may carry out Translations under the terms and conditions detailed in the Developer G.T.S. which expressly provide that all intellectual property rights associated with such Translations will automatically vest in BGA.

Users therefore guarantee that they have read the Developer G.T.S. before engaging in any Translation (within the meaning of the Developer G.T.S.) which they accept in full and undertake to comply with without restriction or reservation.

#### 9\. Premium Subscription

To access the paid Services, the User is invited to purchase a Premium Subscription offered on the Player Site.

With the Premium Subscription, the User can benefit from the following paid services:

◦ Play Premium Applications;

◦ No waiting before playing an Application;

◦ Play from the same terminal, with several players (only one Premium Subscription is required);

◦ Audio or video conferencing to play the Applications with other Premium Subscription Users;

◦ Access to Application usage statistics;

◦ Play an Application with your favourite colour where possible;

◦ Create tournaments;

◦ Other paid services described on the Player Site where applicable.

The Premium Subscription allows access to "Premium Applications". The full list of "Premium Applications" is available on the "Premium" page of the Player Site.

Each "Premium" Application needs at least one (1) User with a Premium Subscription to start. In other words, Premium Users can create new Premium tables, and play with any other User, with or without a Premium Subscription.

The Services provided with the Premium Subscription provide access to "Premium Extensions". "Premium Extensions" are options (i.e. variants) of an Application that are accessible without a Premium Subscription.

An Application with a "Premium Extension" needs at least one (1) User with a Premium Subscription to start. In other words, Premium Users can create new tables with a "Premium Extension" option selected, and play with any other User, with or without a Premium Subscription.

##### 9.1. Purchase of Premium Subscriptions

To purchase a Premium Subscription, the User is invited to fill in a Subscription form in which they will be asked to select the chosen plan (i.e. a monthly or annual Premium Subscription) and to provide the information mentioned on their payment card in order to proceed with the payment. Any Premium Subscription is concluded for its firm duration.

The sums paid for the Premium Subscription are definitively acquired by BGA, including in the event of early termination of the Premium Subscription, which will take effect, in any event, at the end of the period corresponding to the Premium Subscription purchased.

The only mode of communication between BGA and the User being the exchange of emails, the User declares and guarantees in this regard that the information transmitted by them to BGA is sincere and valid and that the email address provided at the time of registration is perfectly valid and in working order.

It is the User's responsibility to inform BGA of any change in their email address.

The purchase of a Premium Subscription can only be made for personal purposes, which the User declares and acknowledges.

The User's failure to comply with all or part of the obligations subscribed to under the terms of these Player G.T.S., and in particular concerning any payment incident relating to the Subscription price, may entitle BGA to deny the User any further purchase of a Subscription until the situation is remedied.

Before purchasing a Premium Subscription, the User is invited to select the duration of the Premium Subscription of their choice, and then to confirm their Subscription by proceeding with its payment.

Prior to payment of the Premium Subscription, the User is invited to accept the terms of these Player G.T.S. It is accepted that the applicable Player G.T.S. are those in force on the day of confirmation of their Premium Subscription.

Once the User has paid for their Premium Subscription and finalised it on the Player Site, a written confirmation will be sent to them by email, summarising the Premium Subscription plan purchased, its price and the terms of use of the services subscribed to.

The User undertakes to keep the elements contained in the Subscription confirmation email, including its attachments.

##### 9.2. Price of Subscriptions

The prices of Premium Subscriptions is indicated on the Player Site in Euros or in the User's local currency including all taxes (VAT and other applicable taxes).

The User acknowledges and accepts that the amount of their Premium Membership does not include the cost of telecommunications allowing access to the paid Services offered on the Player Site and included in their Premium Subscription, nor any other possible costs of connection to the Internet, which remain in all cases the responsibility of the User, in full.

BGA reserves the right to change its prices at any time.

In the event of a change in the price of Premium Subscription plans, this change will be effective from the time of renewal of the User's Subscription, who will receive an email informing them of this change fifteen (15) days before the date of renewal of his Premium Subscription.

If BGA changes the prices of the Premium Membership plans, these changes will be effective as soon as they are posted on the Player Site.

For some payment methods, the issuer of the User's payment method may charge the User certain fees, such as exchange fees or other fees related to the operation of the User's payment method.

The full payment of the Premium Subscription price is made by credit card with its payment service provider using a secure payment process provided by the latter and which does not, in any case, allow BGA to know the User's bank details. Where applicable, full payment of the Premium Subscription price may be made by any other payment method as indicated on the Player Site.

The full payment of the tacitly renewed Premium Subscription price is made via the payment service provider, meaning that the debit date may be changed, for example if the payment method could not be debited temporarily or depending on the applicable working days.

##### 9.3. Duration of Premium Subscriptions

The User is informed that under the terms of Articles L.215-1, L.215-3 and L.241-3 of the Consumer Code relating to the tacit (automatic) renewal of contracts:

"(L.215-1) For service agreements concluded for a fixed term with a tacit renewal clause, the professional service provider must inform the consumer in writing, by personal letter or dedicated email, at the earliest three months and no later than one month before the end of the period authorising the rejection of the renewal, of the possibility not to renew the contract he has concluded with a tacit renewal clause. This information, delivered in clear and comprehensible terms, mentions, in a clearly visible box, the deadline for non-renewal.

Where this information has not been sent to him in accordance with the first subparagraph, the consumer may terminate the contract free of charge at any time from the date of renewal.

Advances made after the last renewal date or, in the case of open-ended contracts, after the date of conversion of the initial fixed-term contract, shall in this case be repaid within 30 days of the date of termination, after deduction of the sums corresponding, until this date, to the performance of the contract.

The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to those which make certain contracts legally subject to special rules concerning consumer information. "

"(L.215-3) The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to contracts concluded between professionals and non-professionals. "

"(L.241-3) Where the trader has not reimbursed under the conditions provided for in Article L. 215- 1, the sums due shall bear interest at the legal rate.

##### 9.4. Tacit and automatic renewal

Whatever the duration of the Premium Subscription and provided that it is technically possible and that it is not a Premium Subscription offered by another User, the User is fully informed that upon its expiry, it will be automatically renewed for a duration identical to that initially subscribed by the User, unless the User cancels it no later than twenty-four (24) hours before the expiry of the current Premium Subscription.

Thus, if the User does not wish to renew or terminate their Subscription, they must log into their Account on the Player Site, go to the "My Preferences" section, then "My Account", and click on "Cancel my subscription" within the time limit referred to above.

In the absence of such notification, the Premium Subscription will be renewed and invoiced on the same basis and at the same intervals as the initial Subscription.

In accordance with Articles L.215-1, L.215-3 and L.241-3 of the Consumer Code reproduced above, BGA will send the User an email informing them of their possibility not to renew the annual Premium Subscription and the terms and conditions of their non-renewal of said Premium Subscription.

#### 10\. Right of withdrawal

The User acknowledges that they have received all the information relating to the Services offered on the Player Site and more specifically to the various Premium Subscription plans offered on the Player Site, before subscribing to them and that the offer of these services complies with the requirements for services provided remotely, in particular via the Internet.

In accordance with the provisions of Article L.221-28° 13 of the Consumer Code, the right of withdrawal cannot be exercised for contracts:

"13° For the supply of digital content not provided on a physical medium whose execution has begun with the express prior agreement of the consumer and the express waiver of his right of withdrawal. "

In accordance with the third paragraph of Article L.221-9 of the Consumer Code:

"The contract shall mention, where appropriate, the consumer's express agreement to the provision of digital content independent of any physical medium before the expiry of the withdrawal period and, in this case, the waiver by the consumer of the right of withdrawal. "

In accordance with the second paragraph of Article L.221-13 of the Consumer Code:

"Where applicable, the trader shall provide the consumer, under the same conditions and before the expiry of the withdrawal period, with confirmation of his express agreement to the provision of digital content not presented on a physical medium and his waiver of the right of withdrawal. "

However, if the User decides to withdraw from their Premium Subscription without giving any reason, within a period of fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of confirmation of their Premium Subscription by BGA, the User must inform BGA of their intention, at the latest within the aforementioned period of fourteen (14) days, either by completing and sending to BGA the Withdrawal Form attached to these Player G.T.S. and by following the instructions contained therein; or, by expressing their intention to withdraw in a clear and unequivocal manner including the essential information to do so by email or by post to BGA whose full contact details are available by [clicking here](https://boardgamearena.com/legal?section=legal).

As soon as possible after BGA has received the Withdrawal Form or the notification of the User's wish to exercise their right of withdrawal, BGA will send acknowledgement of receipt to the User by email. The costs associated with sending the Withdrawal Form shall be borne by the User.

#### 11\. Intellectual property

##### 11.1. Use of Services

The Services are designed, published and managed by or on behalf of BGA. The User acknowledges and accepts that access to the Applications, Content and Services made available by BGA does not imply any transfer of intellectual property rights to the User.

### General Terms of Services

#### Preamble

The purpose of the BGA Sites is to allow the greatest number of people to discover new Games and to play them through the Applications. To this end, BGA offers Users who so wish to participate in the development of the Applications and/or BGA Sites, and in particular the Services on the Developer Site provide the User with an ecosystem enabling them to develop Code.

This activity is neither compulsory nor remunerated and its sole purpose is to allow Users who wish to do so to engage in computer developments, in particular the digitisation of Games, and to provide them with a medium enabling them to publish their Creations and Codes.

If the User does not wish to have their Intellectual Property Rights on their Creations and/or Codes vested in and/or licensed to BGA, they must not communicate their Creations and/or Codes in any way, either through the BGA Sites or by any other means.

However, in order to enable BGA to respect the Licences subscribed to with the publishers of the Games and therefore to operate the BGA Sites, the grant or assignment of the Intellectual Property Rights associated with the Users' Codes and Creations must be regulated. This is the purpose of Article 6, which provides for a licence to be granted on the Users' Codes, and Article 7, which provides for the assignment of the intellectual property rights on Creations to BGA.

The user acknowledges and accepts that the production of users' Creations and Codes as well as the vesting and/or assignment and/or granting of Intellectual Property Rights relating thereto are carried out free of charge. The User waives, in full knowledge of the facts, the benefit of Articles L.131-6 of the Intellectual Property Code.

You can develop board games to make them available online on BGA as a volunteer software developer :)

#### 1\. Purpose of these Developer G.T.S.

The purpose of these Developer G.T.S. is to define the conditions of use of the Developer Site and the Services accessible free of charge subject to the prior creation of an Account. The Services accessible free of charge subject to the prior creation of an Account on the Player Site, the Services accessible subject to the purchase of a Premium Subscription, their terms and conditions, are detailed in the Player G.T.S. available by [clicking here](https://boardgamearena.com/legal?section=tos). The Services accessible free of charge without the need to create an Account, their terms and conditions, are detailed in the G.T.U. available by [clicking here](https://boardgamearena.com/legal?section=tosv) of which these Developer G.T.S. are an integral part.

#### 2\. Acceptance and modification of the Developer G.T.S.

##### 2.1. Acceptance of the Developer G.T.S.

These Developer G.T.S. govern the rights, obligations and restrictions associated with the use of the Developer Site and/or the Applications and/or the Services.

IN PARTICULAR, THESE DEVELOPER G.T.S. PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE GRANT OR ASSIGNMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ON USERS' CREATIONS AND CODES. THEREFORE, IF THE USER REFUSES THE TERMS OF THESE DEVELOPER G.T.S., THEY ARE INVITED NOT TO USE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE FROM THE DEVELOPER SITE AND NOT TO SEND CREATIONS OR CODES TO BGA.

Access to the Developer Site and/or the Applications and/or the use of all or part of the Services, the Applications and/or the communication by the User to BGA of Creations and/or Codes implies that the User accepts and undertakes to respect the Developer G.T.S., the Privacy Policy, the G.T.U., any other disclaimer, and/or other applicable contractual terms and conditions without reservation.

BGA hereby authorises the User to access and use the Developer Site and/or the Applications and/or the Services, subject to compliance with the conditions set out in the G.T.U. and the User is informed that failure to comply with any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Developer G.T.S.

You should use this service only if you agree with the terms.

##### 2.2. Modifications of the Developer G.T.S.

BGA reserves the right to periodically modify these Developer G.T.S. and the Privacy Policy, for example to adapt them to legislative and regulatory changes, or to modify the features offered on the Developer Site and/or the Services and/or the Applications.

BGA will inform the Users, as far as possible, within a maximum of fifteen (15) days before the entry into force of the amended Developer G.T.S. Consequently, the User is invited to regularly consult these Developer G.T.S. If the User does not accept the amended Developer G.T.S., they must stop using the Services. Continuing to use the Services beyond the date of publication of the amended Developer G.T.S. will presume the User's acceptance of the amended Developer G.T.S.

The use of the Services available on the Developer Site requires the creation of an Account carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Player G.T.S., with the following exceptions:

\- In order to create an Account on the Developer Site, the User must first have an Account on the Player Site.

\- The Identification Data required on the Developer Site may be different from that required on the Player Site.

#### 5\. Editorial policy of the BGA Sites

Each User may create Creations and/or Codes in order to develop all or part of an Application and/or a BGA Site, and allow other Users or BGA to participate.

In order to contribute to an Application, the User must necessarily and compulsorily select a Game for which BGA benefits from a Licence or obtain BGA's prior and express agreement, without which BGA cannot be held liable and the User must guarantee and hold BGA harmless against any claims and/or actions by third parties in this respect.

In order to allow BGA to respect the Licence granted to it by a publisher, the User undertakes to:

• Deliver their Creations and Codes to BGA exclusively from the Developer Site in a format that is interoperable and compatible with the Player Site, in particular by complying with the Specifications;

• Deliver all of their Creations and Codes and in particular the source code of the Codes, the associated documentation as well as any document necessary for the publication and exploitation, if applicable commercial, of the Application.

The User undertakes, in the context of the production of the Creations and/or Codes, to comply with all legal, statutory and regulatory provisions relating to the Creations, Codes, the Game and the Application, where applicable in accordance with the Specifications.

The User undertakes not to include in their Creations and/or Codes, without BGA's prior and express consent, excessive scenes of violence, racist opinions, or any element likely to prevent the commercial distribution of the Application.

The User undertakes not to introduce into the Application and/or their Creations or Codes any element (sound, graphic, script, visual or other) which, by its nature, would affect the image and/or reputation of the Game and the Application and/or BGA and/or the Game publisher.

BGA must have a license for the game (if it's not in the public domain), and your adaptation must be faithful to the game.

The User is informed that BGA is solely responsible for the editorial policy of the BGA Sites and, as such, decides at its own discretion whether or not to publish and/or withdraw the Creations and/or Codes and/or Applications created by and/or in which the Users participate and, if applicable, already published. These arbitrary choices are explained by BGA's overall editorial policy for the BGA Sites and consequently cannot prejudice Users in any way. Indeed, BGA does not guarantee under any circumstances the publication on the BGA Sites of the Creations and/or Codes created, developed and/or communicated by the User, without the User being able to claim any compensation or damage in this respect.

BGA will credit on the BGA Sites the User who has participated in an Application on the description page of the Application, with reference to their BGA Username, supplemented with their real name if the User explicitly requests this, unless the User explicitly requests anonymity.

#### 6\. User Codes

##### 6.1. Types of User Codes

This article details the types of Codes that can be produced by any User of the Developer Site, without this being an exhaustive list.

###### 6.1.1. Contribution to an Application and/or a BGA Site

Each User may develop Codes to create a new Application and/or participate in an ongoing Application project.

Once the Application project is finalised, its validation takes place in three phases:

• Alpha version: The User who initiated the Application project will present it for acceptance on the Player Site exclusively for technical and/or functional testing by a BGA Approver. The BGA Approver will test the Application project, notify any defects identified in the Application project and assess the quality of the Application project. After initial testing by the BGA Approver, the Alpha version of the Application project will be analysed and reviewed by BGA and/or the Licensor. BGA and/or the Licensor will review the Application project and in particular its compliance with the Specifications. Most major defects will necessarily have to be addressed and corrected by any User in order to launch the second acceptance phase.

• Beta version: Once accepted by BGA and/or the Licensor, the Alpha version is published on the Player Site for testing and acceptance by all Users of the Player Site to verify the quality of the Application project, its compliance with the Game and the Specifications and that no defects remain. Once this phase has been completed and all remaining notified defects have been fully corrected by a User, BGA will publish the Application resulting from the validated Application project at its discretion, without any deadline obligation for BGA.

The User undertakes not to include - in the Codes - programs under open source license without the prior consent of BGA in order to allow BGA to ensure that the licence conditions of said open source codes do not have any contaminating effect that could alter their operation and use by BGA.

###### 6.1.2. Corrections of Anomalies on the BGA Sites and/or on the Applications

Each User may develop Codes to correct an Anomaly, identified on the Developer Site (but which may concern the BGA Sites and/or an Application). To do so, the User will develop a Code useful for the correction of an Anomaly directly from the Developer Site and submit it to BGA for approval and/or proceed directly with its publication if they have received the appropriate accreditations from BGA.

The Codes, once approved by BGA, are posted online. Otherwise, BGA will explain to the User the reasons why it has refused to post the Codes online and the User may then correct their previous Codes or submit new ones or do nothing.

##### 6.2. Intellectual Property Rights on Codes

The User is and remains the owner of all Intellectual Property Rights on the Codes provided to BGA, provided that they cannot be qualified as a collective work within the meaning of the applicable law.

The User will therefore be able to freely exploit their Codes, subject to the rights of third parties, and in particular the elements made available by BGA or by other Users, or the elements resulting from the Licence of the Game for which the Code has been developed. The User expressly acknowledges and accepts that all information, documents, graphic, technical and computer elements, tools, visuals, brands, logos or other elements belonging to BGA or to the Licensor and made available to the User for the purposes of creating the Codes (hereinafter the "Pre-existing Elements") are and remain the exclusive property of BGA or of the Licensor and may not be used by the User for any purpose other than strict exploitation on the BGA Sites. Any other use of the Pre-existing Elements outside the BGA Sites is strictly prohibited.

In this context, the User acknowledges and agrees to grant BGA a licence on the Intellectual Property Rights of a proprietary nature attached to the Codes, (in particular with regard to the tools, devices and programming engines integrated into the Codes as well as their source codes, whether compiled or not) free of charge, non-exclusive for the territory of the whole world and for the entire duration of the protection currently granted to the Codes, or which will be granted in the future to the authors of intellectual works within the meaning of the Intellectual Property Code by French laws and regulations as well as by international conventions.

Intellectual Property Rights of a proprietary nature granted to BGA on the User's Code(s) include:

\- the right to use and exploit it commercially, including for Premium Applications, to distribute it and to license (or sub-license) it;

\- the right to represent and reproduce it, in as many copies as BGA deems necessary, on any medium, format or network, known and unknown on the date the Code is made available by the User, directly or indirectly, in particular by unit sales, subscription, downloading or rental via the Internet by streaming or game on demand, compilation, or by licences freely granted by BGA and the third parties of its choice;

\- the right to modify it, in whole or in part, by addition, deletion, correction, etc.;

\- the right to adapt it in whole or in part;

\- the right to develop, add or delete it, in whole or in part, in the context of a port to all consoles and all operating systems known or unknown on the date of execution of this agreement.

\- the right to incorporate it, in whole or in part, into any pre-existing or future work;

\- the right to rewrite it in any other computer language;

\- the right to translate it into another language;

\- the right to use it on other media or to adapt it to operating systems other than those used or known at the time of subscription to the Developer G.T.S.;

\- the right to exploit it in any form, in particular in the form of merchandising for one or more Sequel(s) and/or Prequel(s) and/or Spin-offs;

\- the right to file and/or register it with any competent office, including from the time of its conception, in its name and on its behalf,

The User acknowledges and accepts that BGA is entitled to have all or part of the above rights granted to it exercised by a third party of its choice, including, where applicable, another User.

In this sense, Users may publish their Code with the exception of Pre-existing Elements on any separate medium under any licence of their choice, provided that the following notice is included in a comment on the Code: **“This code was developed on the BGA studio platform for use on http://boardgamearena.com”**.

You can open your code under any license compatible with its use on BGA, as long as you include the above mentioned sentence as comment in your code.

Game assets stay the property of the game rights owner and should not be made available outside of BGA.

#### 7\. Creations

##### 7.1. Types of Creation

This article details the types of Creations that can be made by any User, without this being an exhaustive list.

###### 7.1.1. Contribution to the BGA Documentation

Each User may, at their own discretion, update the BGA Documentation, without said contribution being subject to any a priori approval, verification or moderation by BGA.

###### 7.1.2. Translations

Translations can be made directly from the Player Site. Each User may thus translate all or part of the BGA Sites and/or Applications.

The User undertakes to carry out a Translation only if the target language is their mother tongue or one that they are fluent in. When translating an Application, the User must be truly familiar with the Application and, if possible, have a box and a booklet of the physical game rules from which the Application originates in the target language in order to verify their consistency. Users making Translations must take into account the language level and formal/informal pronominal rules customary for the game's audience in their country.

The source/reference language for the Translation is English, as the development of the BGA Sites and Applications is carried out in English, which means that modifying a text in English leads to modifications in all languages. The User who carries out the Translation undertakes to respect the final punctuation (or absence thereof), the choice of words in capital letters and the use of numbers instead of words.

Translations can be modified until they are "validated". Validation takes place after thirty (30) days without modification. It is then considered stable and valid (golden icon) and can only be modified by Users with significant experience on the Player Site.

###### 7.1.3. Contribution to an Application and/or a BGA Site

Each User may, at their discretion, propose on the Developer Site works derived from the Games, the BGA Sites and/or any other element on which a third party holds Intellectual Property Rights.

These Creations (artworks, logos, graphic creations in digital format, etc.) are distinct from the Users' Codes for which the Users retain ownership of their Intellectual Property Rights and grant a licence to BGA in accordance with the provisions of Article 6.

##### 7.2. Intellectual Property Rights on Creations

###### 7.2.1. Vesting of Intellectual Property Rights on Creations in favour of BGA

In accordance with the provisions of Article L.113-2 of the Intellectual Property Code, the Applications and, where necessary, the Creations must be considered as collective works, which each User expressly acknowledges and accepts.

Indeed, the User acknowledges that these Creations have been created at the initiative of BGA (which has in particular taken the necessary and useful steps to obtain a Licence) which will edit, publish and disclose the Creations via the Applications and the BGA Sites, under its direction and name.

The Creations of each User are thus merged into the Applications and BGA Sites for which they were designed, without it being possible to ultimately attribute to each of the Users who are the authors of these Creations a distinct right over the entirety produced, i.e. the Applications and/or the BGA Sites.

In this respect, the User acknowledges that the Creations and/or the Applications and the BGA Sites are collective works, the property of BGA, which is the sole owner of the intellectual property rights.

###### 7.2.2. Assignment of Intellectual Property Rights on Creations in favour of BGA

If one or more elements making up the Creations should be considered as not resulting from a collective work, in order to avoid any future dispute over the scope of BGA's rights, and in order to ensure BGA's legal certainty in the use decided upon, the User expressly acknowledges that the Intellectual Property Rights attached to the Creations are assigned immediately and free of charge to the exclusive benefit of BGA for the entire world and for the entire duration of the protection currently granted to the Creations, or which will be granted in the future to the authors of intellectual works within the meaning of the Intellectual Property Code by French laws and regulations as well as by international conventions.

Consequently, BGA is the sole owner of all Intellectual Property Rights relating to said Creations and to all physical media provided or developed by the User for these Creations, including, but not limited to, any written, graphic, photographic, audio, audiovisual, process, program, sub-program, software, part of software, source code, object code and any other programming code created and/or developed, in any form and on any medium known or unknown to date.

The assignment and transfer of Intellectual Property Rights will take effect as and when the User produces the Creations, meaning that BGA will acquire ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights on the Creations, whether or not they are validated and/or distributed and/or exploited by BGA and whether or not the BGA Sites and/or Applications for which the Creations are intended are validated and/or distributed and/or exploited by BGA.

In order to comply with the provisions of Article L.122-7 of the Intellectual Property Code, which requires that the nature and extent of the possible uses be mentioned, it is expressly stipulated that the User acknowledges and accepts that the free assignment of Intellectual Property Rights of a proprietary nature on the Creations means:

\- the right to use and exploit them commercially, including for Premium Applications, to distribute and license (or sub-license) them in any form whatsoever, even if this is not foreseen or foreseeable at the date of subscription to the Developer G.T.S.;

\- the right to reproduce them, by any means and on any medium, known and unknown at the date of subscription to the Developer G.T.S. and in as many copies as BGA deems necessary, on any medium, format or network, known and unknown at the date of execution of this Contract, directly or indirectly, in particular by unit sales, subscription, download or rental via the Internet by streaming or game on demand, compilation, or by licences freely granted by BGA and third parties of its choice;

\- the right to represent them by any means, known and unknown at the date of subscription to the Developer G.T.S., including radio, cable, satellite, Internet, Intranet, Extranet, etc.;

\- the right to modify them, in whole or in part, by addition, deletion, correction, etc.;

\- the right to adapt them in whole or in part;

\- the right to adapt, modify, evolve, add or delete them, in whole or in part, in the context of a port to all consoles and all operating systems known or unknown on the date of execution of this agreement.

\- the right to incorporate them, in whole or in part, into any pre-existing or future work;

\- the right to make them evolve, to develop them;

\- the right to rewrite them in any other computer language;

\- the right to translate them into another language;

\- the right to use them on other media or to adapt them to operating systems other than those used or known at the time of subscription to the Developer G.T.S.;

\- the right to assign the Developer G.T.S. to any third party of their choice;

\- the right to exploit it in any form, in particular in the form of merchandising for one or more Sequel(s) and/or Prequel(s) and/or Spin-offs;

\- And, in general, all the author's property rights over his creation.

The User acknowledges and accepts that BGA is entitled to have all or part of the aforementioned operations carried out by a third party of its choice, including, where applicable, another User.

The User declares and guarantees that they will not exploit or register any Intellectual Property Rights relating to the Creations, either in their own name or in the name of any other natural or legal person whatsoever.

You give BGA the rights to use your board game adaptations. Otherwise, nothing can happen :)

#### 8\. Confidentiality

The User undertakes to keep confidential the elements provided by BGA and/or by the publisher of a Game, to enable it to carry out and develop the Creations and Codes. In the event that the User publishes their Code on any separate medium under any licence of their choice under the conditions of Article 6.2, they shall refrain from adding to it the elements provided by BGA and/or by the publisher of a Game, to enable them to create and develop the Creations and Codes in order to preserve their confidentiality.

#### 9\. BGA's Intellectual Property Rights

The User acknowledges that the subscription to these Developer G.T.S. does not entail any transfer to them of any Intellectual Property Rights.

BGA, as the case may be, is and remains the owner of all Intellectual Property Rights and exploitation rights on pre-existing elements belonging to it (notably on the Services) provided to the User in the framework of the Developer G.T.S.

The Services are designed, published and managed by or on behalf of BGA.

Access to the Services is exclusively limited to the private and personal use of the User under the conditions and within the limits defined in the G.T.U. and these Developer G.T.S.

#### 10\. Guarantees and liability of the User

Due to the gratuitous nature of the assignment, grant and/or vesting of the Intellectual Property Rights on Creations and Codes under the Developer G.T.S., the Creations and Codes are provided "as is" to BGA, without any guarantees as to the suitability of the Creations and Codes for the use for which they are intended, their commercial value, their secure, innovative or relevant nature.

Notwithstanding full compliance with these Developer G.T.S., the User thus offers, without limitation, no guarantee, express or tacit, concerning: (i) the ability of the Creations and Codes to fulfil the objectives that BGA has set itself, or to perform in the combinations of use chosen by BGA (ii) the absence of errors or the uninterrupted performance of the Creations and Codes (iii) the possible or potential correction of any errors in the Creations and Codes (iv) the compatibility of the Creations and Codes, or of the data structures generated by the use of the Creations and Codes, with a subsequent edition or version of the Applications, if any, or with the BGA Sites.

However, the User declares and guarantees to BGA that they have all the necessary rights to the Creations and Codes for the assignment or grant of the related Intellectual Property Rights as provided for in Articles 6 and 7 above.

Consequently, the User guarantees BGA the peaceful enjoyment of the Intellectual Property Rights assigned or granted under the Developer G.T.S. and shall hold BGA harmless against any claim(s), action(s), recourse or lawsuit(s) brought against it by a third party.

In the event of an out-of-court or legal claim by a third party against BGA, based on the fact that a Creation or Code is unlawful and/or infringes upon the rights, in particular the Intellectual Property Rights, of third parties, the User undertakes to defend BGA, at their own expense, against any such action and to indemnify BGA for any damage of any nature whatsoever that BGA may suffer as a result of such a challenge and, in any event, undertakes to pay any damages that BGA may be ordered to pay and to bear all reasonable costs resulting from any judicial or extrajudicial action taken by a third party.

You don't have any obligation related to the board game adaptations you create, as long as you don't include improperly licensed elements.

#### 11\. Termination of the Account

The User may terminate their Account under the terms and conditions of the Player G.T.S.

Articles 6, 7, 8 and 9 of these Developer G.T.S. shall in any case survive the termination of the Account by the User or by BGA, which means that the termination of the Account by the User or by BGA shall not call into question the ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights on the Creations and/or Codes as provided for in these Developer G.T.S.
