* **Providing Our Sites, Services and Features.**We may use the information we collect to provide, personalize, maintain, and improve our products, Sites and Services, including as described in the Terms of Use. This includes using information to:

    1. protect, investigate, respond to, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity;
    2. monitor and verify identity or service access;
    3. protect against spam, malware, or security risks;
    4. perform internal operations necessary to provide our Services, including to troubleshoot software bugs and operational issues;

* **Legal and Regulatory Compliance.** Many of our Sites and Services are subject to laws and regulations requiring us to collect, use, and store your personal information in certain ways. For example, we must identify and verify customers using our Sites or Services in order to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. This may include collection and storage of your photo identification. We also use third parties to verify your identity by comparing the personal information you provide against third party, authoritative sources and databases, including public records. When you attempt to link a bank account to your account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or to manage risk as required under applicable law. If you do not provide information required by law, we will have to close your account. We may also use the information we collect to investigate or address claims or disputes relating to use of our Sites and Services, or as otherwise allowed by applicable law, or as requested by regulators, government entities, and official inquiries.
* **Direct Marketing.** We may use the information we collect to market our Sites and Services to you. This may include sending you communications via emails or mobile app notifications about our Sites, Services, features, promotions, surveys, news, updates, and events; managing your participation in these promotions and events; and to deliver targeted marketing. Our marketing will be conducted according to your advertising and marketing preferences and as permitted by applicable law.

How and Why We Disclose Information
=====================================

We may disclose your information, including your Personal Information, in the following circumstances:

* **With Your Consent.** You may permit us to disclose your personal information with others for any other purposes disclosed to you with your consent.
* **With Our Affiliates.** Where appropriate, we may disclose your information with BAM Management US Holdings Inc, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and/or affiliates in the course of conducting business and offering our Services to you. Please be advised that BAM Trading and its affiliated companies are separate and distinct legal entities from Binance Holdings Limited (“BHL”). **BAM Trading does not have any records for, and cannot respond to record requests, addressed to BHL.** For more information, please refer to our Law Enforcement Guide.
* **To Comply With Our Legal Obligations.** We may disclose your information with courts, law enforcement authorities, regulators, attorneys or other parties: (A) to comply with laws and legal obligations; (B) for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal or equitable claim; (C) to respond to law enforcement and regulatory requests, including (1) when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, search or seizure warrant, or similar legal procedure, or (2) for international law enforcement requests, pursuant to a mutual legal assistance treaty or letter rogatory; (D) to comply with one or more forms of “travel rules” that require our transmitting of your information to another financial institution; (E) when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers, us, or others, including to prevent imminent physical harm or material financial loss; (F) to investigate violations of our Terms of Use or other applicable policies; or (G) to report suspected illegal activity or to assist law enforcement in the investigation of suspected illegal or wrongful activity.
* **With Third-Party Identity Verification Services.** We may disclose your information with third party identity verification service providers for the purposes of identity verification, fraud prevention, and denial of service to persons presenting an unacceptable level of money-laundering or terrorism-financing risks. These service providers confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other authoritative third-party databases (e.g., credit bureaus). These providers may create derivative data based on your personal information that they can use in connection with provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services. We do not control these providers’ privacy policies and we contractually require these service providers to only use your information in accordance with our legal agreements.
    1. For example, we use Plaid, Inc. (“Plaid”) for identity verification services to identify and authenticate you when you create or reactivate an account with us. Specifically, Plaid will verify that the selfie you provide matches the photo on your government-issued ID. The information collected during this process may constitute biometric data (to learn more about our Biometric Data Practices, please review our Biometric Data Privacy Policy). To learn more about Plaid’s privacy practices, please visit the Plaid End User Privacy Policy. By submitting your information, you agree to Plaid’s Privacy Policy.
* **With Service Providers.** We may disclose your information on a confidential basis with service providers who help facilitate business operations such as payment processing, marketing, security, or information technology services. Our legal agreements require these service providers to only use your information according to our instructions.
* **For Advertising Purposes.** Some U.S. state laws classify service providers engaged in select advertising services as ‘third party businesses’ or ‘independent controllers.’ As noted below in our [‘Online Tracking Opt-Out Guide’](#tracking), you have the right to restrict these types of advertising services providers’ use of your personal information. For clarity, Binance.US does not ‘sell’ personal information with these advertising services for monetary consideration, but disclosure may be classified as a ‘sale’ under various state privacy laws.
* **With Financial Institutions.** We may disclose your information with financial institutions to process payments you have authorized.
    1. For example, we use Plaid to connect your Binance.US account with your bank account, verify your bank account, and confirm your bank account balance prior to approving a transaction. Information disclosed to Plaid is treated by Plaid in accordance with the Plaid End User Privacy Policy. By linking your bank account through Plaid, you consent to Plaid’s Privacy Policy.
* **With Our Professional Advisors.** We may disclose your information with our professional advisors such as accountants, auditors, lawyers, insurers, bankers, and blockchain forensic services in order to complete third party audits and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.
* **With Other Binance.US Users (Pay and Crypto Box).** We may disclose your information with other users when you redeem a Crypto Box or use our Pay feature to send, request, or receive cryptocurrency. For example, when you redeem a Crypto Box, your first name, last initial, and amount received will be visible to other recipients of that particular Crypto Box. If you do not wish your Binance.US account to be searchable by other users, you may go to **Account Settings → Security** and toggle off the **“Discoverable”** option.
* **During A Change To Our Business.** If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets or stock, financing, public offering of securities, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities, some or all of your information may be disclosed or transferred.
* **Aggregated or De-identified Data.** We may create de-identified or anonymous data from Personal Information by removing certain data components (such as your name or email address) that makes the data personally identifiable to you, or through obfuscation. We may disclose aggregated and/or anonymized data with third parties for their own uses.

International Transfers
=========================

Our retail Services are directed and offered only to individuals within supported regions in the United States. Our institutional Services are available to companies, or companies with beneficial owners, that may be located outside of the United States. All data is stored in the United States using Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). As such, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), we may transfer to, and store the data we collect about you, to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected, including the United States. Those countries may not have equivalent data protection laws as the country in which you provided the data. When we transfer your data to other countries, we will protect the data as described in this Privacy Policy and comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of data to countries outside the EEA and UK. We rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) for the transfer of personal data (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation, or “GDPR”) to countries that have not received an applicable adequacy decision, as well as the UK’s International Data Transfer Addendum to the SCCs. By using the Site and Services you agree to the privacy practices laid out in this Policy.

For more information on cross-border transfers of your Personal Information, the appropriate safeguards in place, please refer to the Supplemental EEA/UK Privacy Policy.

Security
==========

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (“Security Controls”) designed to protect the personal information we maintain against unauthorized access or disclosure. While no system is completely secure due to real-time and emerging cyber threats and bad actors, we take reasonable steps to secure your information. When registering for our Sites or Services, choose a complex password and turn on advanced security features, such as two-factor authentication. Never share your account credentials with third-parties and submit a Customer Support ticket here if you become aware of unauthorized access to or use of your account.

**You are responsible for all activity on the account that is associated with your login credentials.**

Data Retention
================

BAM retains your Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations (i.e., if we are required to retain your data or the information you provided to us to comply with applicable laws, including anti-money-laundering, anti-terrorism, or other financial laws and regulations). In addition, we will retain and use your personal information to resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

To determine how long we will retain your personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.

BAM will retain your Personal information for marketing purposes, where applicable, until you unsubscribe from our marketing communications. At that time, we may retain the Sites and Services’ usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Sites and Services, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.

BAM will retain biometric data as part of customer identification information for the retention period required by financial laws and regulations. You can learn more about our biometric data practices in our Biometric Data Privacy Policy.

Your Privacy Rights
=====================

It is BAM’s policy to offer certain privacy rights to all individuals, regardless of whether a statutory right exists. The rights that BAM offers to all individuals include the following:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to request what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, or share about you, as applicable.
* **Right to Access/Portability.** You can request access to and/or a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.
* **Right to Delete.** You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected or maintain about you, subject to exceptions. Please note that we are required to retain certain Personal Information and related data to comply with our legal obligations, including compliance with recordkeeping requirements contained in anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, or other financial laws and regulations.
* **Right to Correct.** You can ask us to correct inaccurate personal information we maintain about you.
    1. To request updates or corrections to your personal information, please contact Customer Support at https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/requests/new. You can also update certain account profile information by logging into your account.
* **Right to Opt Out.** You can opt out of certain uses of your personal information:
    1. **Marketing and Promotional Communications.** If you would like to stop receiving marketing or promotional messages, notifications, or updates, you may do so by following the unsubscribe instructions that appear in these email communications, or you may contact us at [privacy@binance.us](mailto:privacy@binance.us) to opt out of direct marketing. Please be advised that you may not be able to opt out of receiving certain service or transactional messages from us, including legal notices.
    2. **Targeted Advertising.** You may opt out of targeted advertising (see [Online Tracking Opt-Out Guide](#tracking) below).

You can exercise these rights by contacting us at [privacy@binance.us](mailto:privacy@binance.us). To protect your privacy and security, we may request specific information from you to help us verify your identity before complying with your request. We are not obligated to provide or to delete any information pursuant to your request if we are unable to adequately verify your identity.

We reserve the right to lawfully refuse to act on a request, or to charge a reasonable administrative fee when a request is either manifestly unfounded or excessive because of its repetitive character.

Some states provide their residents with additional privacy rights. Please review our [U.S. State Specific Notice](#us-state-specific-notices) for more information about these rights.

U.S. State-Specific Notice(s)
===============================

Some U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act or “CPRA” (collectively, the “CCPA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”), the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (“OCPA”), the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (“TXDPSA”), and the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (“MTCDPA”) create additional privacy obligations for businesses and provide their residents with additional privacy rights. In addition to the rights granted above (see [“Your Privacy Rights”](#privacy)), if you are a resident of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Oregon, Texas, or Montana you have the right to:

* **Information.** For details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the What We Collect section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How We Use Information section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the [How and Why We Disclose Information](#sharing) section above.
* **Opt out of the “sale” or “share” of your personal information for targeted advertising.** BAM does not ‘sell’ your personal information for monetary benefit. However, some third-party cookies placed on our website may be considered a ‘sale’ or a ‘share’ for the purposes of targeted advertising as defined under these privacy laws. Note, advertising partners are contractually restricted from using personal information collected by Binance.US for their own independent marketing purposes. You may opt out of such advertising cookies that may be classified as a ‘sale’ or ‘share’ for targeted advertising as detailed in the [Online Tracking Opt-Out Guide](#tracking) below.
* **Limit the Use and Disclosure of Your Sensitive Personal Information.** BAM only collects that sensitive personal information which is necessary for us to provide our Services. As such, limiting our use of your sensitive personal information would result in us not being able to provide our Services.

In addition to the mechanisms above, you can also exercise these rights by emailing us at [privacy@binance.us](mailto:privacy@binance.us)or by contacting our customer support via live chat.

Some residents may have the right to empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.

**Appeals**

If we deny your privacy request, you may appeal that decision by emailing us at privacy@binance.us. If you are still unsatisfied with our response, you have the right to file a complaint with your state attorney general.

**Business/Controller Designation**

BAM operates as a Controller (and a ‘Business’ under CCPA) on behalf of our users.

Online Tracking Opt-Out Guide
===============================

Like many companies, we use cookies, pixels, web beacons, SDKs, and other tracking technologies (“cookies”) to collect information about your browsing activities, your interactions with websites (including our Sites) and apps (including our mobile app), and to serve tailored ads. You can opt out of our use of cookies via our Cookie Preference Center.

To learn more about our use of cookies and similar tracking technologies, visit our Cookie Policy.

Mobile Privacy
================

The Binance.US app uses software code provided by our business partners (software development kits or SDKs) that let our software interact with the services those partners provide. Sometimes these interactions will involve that business partner collecting some information from the device on which the software is run.

To learn more, visit our Cookie Policy or email us at [privacy@binance.us](mailto:privacy@binance.us).

GLBA Disclosure
=================

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) requires financial institutions to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to provide the customer the ability to opt out of certain disclosures of their personal information. In addition, the GLBA prescribes certain safeguards for sensitive data held by financial institutions. You can review our GLBA Consumer Privacy Notice here.

Children’s Privacy
====================

We do not allow use of our Services and Sites by anyone younger than 18 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 18 has unlawfully provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at [privacy@binance.us](mailto:privacy@binance.us) and we will take steps to delete such information, close any such accounts, and prevent the user from continuing to use our Services.

Links to Third-Party Sites
============================

Our Services or Sites may contain links to other websites or services. We do not exercise control over the information you provide or is collected by these third-party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
