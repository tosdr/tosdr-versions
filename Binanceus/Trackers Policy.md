App Tracking
============

The Binance.US app uses software codes provided by our mobile application business partners (software development kits or SDKs) that let our mobile application software interact with the services those partners provide. Sometimes these interactions will involve that business partner collecting some information from the device on which the software is run.

**To view our app privacy disclosure:**

On iOS:

* Open the **App Store**. Go to the Binance.US app page. Scroll to the **App Privacy** section. Click **See Details**.

On Android:

* Open **Google Play**. Browse or use the search bar to find the Binance.US app. Click on the app. Under **Data safety**, you’ll find a summary of the app’s data safety practices. For more detail, tap **See details**.

**To opt out of ‘tracking’ through your mobile operating system:**

On iOS:

* When you download and open a new app, you'll get a notification that asks if you want to let the app track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites. You'll also see information about what the app would track. You can tap **Ask App not to Track** to block that activity or Allow.
* For apps that you've already downloaded and may have tracking permissions set up for, you can opt out of tracking if you go to Settings, tap an app, and then tap to turn off **Allow Tracking**. Alternatively, you may go to **Settings \> Privacy \> Tracking**. There you will see a list of apps that have requested permission to track your activity. You can tap to turn tracking on or off for each app.

On Android:

* Go to the **Settings** app and navigate to **Privacy \> Ads**. Tap **Delete advertising ID**, then tap it again on the next page to confirm. This will prevent any app on your phone from accessing it in the future.

Changes To This Policy
======================

We may revise this Cookie Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will change the Last Updated date above. We encourage you to review and revisit this Policy to stay informed.
