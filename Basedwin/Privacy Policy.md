Who we share your data with

Most of our products do not currently ship from our own warehouses which means we must forward your name and address to our vendors so they can create a shipping label to mail your items to you. We **do not** forward your email address to our vendors. When based.win starts selling in house products these will shipped by a based.win employee and your address info will not be sent to a 3rd party vendor for those orders.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
