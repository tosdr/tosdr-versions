Such activity is STRICTLY prohibited. TrafficWave.net will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision. This action WILL RESULT in immediate termination of your account without refund. Any service interruptions as a result of Customers spamming will be billed to the Customer at $150.00 per hour until service is restored. Customer will also be in violation of the TrafficWave.net Terms of Service and subject to legal action.

Importing or in any way using purchased leads with a TrafficWave.net account is strictly prohibited. If you paid money or in any way purchased a group of pre-existing leads, or in any way acquired leads without specific expressed consent, these leads may not be used with TrafficWave.net. This includes co-registration services, "safe lists" or any type of free leads given to you. Only people that have specifically requested information directly from you may be emailed through TrafficWave.net.

Batching or in any way trying to script the addition of new subscribers to the web form subscription methods is strictly forbidden. A script must not be used to auto submit a web form subscriber on behalf of a website visitor. The visitor who desires to subscribe to your list must be the one to activate that subscription process with express consent.

No individual under the age of sixteen (16) may use the Services, provide any personal information to TrafficWave.net or otherwise submit personal information through TrafficWave.net (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address). If the parent or guardian of a child discovers that the child has submitted any information to TrafficWave.net, they should contact us immediately at the address listed below.

Pornography and sex-related merchandising are prohibited on any TrafficWave.net server. TrafficWave.net will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision and will have the legal right to assess a $150 per hour charge (with a one hour minimum) for the location and removal of such material or information. Such charges will be applied to the Customer's payment information on file.

The collecting of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation is prohibited. TrafficWave.net will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of this provision.

Payment is due immediately on the billing date listed in the Customer's Members Area. All payments must be in US dollars. The Customer is responsible for providing up-to-date payment information.

Credit card payments will be billed and charged automatically.

In the event a payment is declined, Customer's account will be temporarily deactivated for a period of 10 days. Customer will be sent email notification to log in and bring the account current with valid payment information.

Any TrafficWave.net Customer may cancel his or her account at any time by using the "Cancel Account" link found under "Account Profile" in the TrafficWave.net Members Area at [http://www.trafficwave.net/login.html](https://www.trafficwave.net/login.html "TrafficWave.net Login Page").

Alternately, any Customer may issue their cancellation request in writing to the address below. For such cancellation requests, TrafficWave.net will have no less than 30 days to fulfill such request upon receipt. Such request shall be deemed to be received and fulfilled when processed and subsequently verified by our staff.

For all Customer cancellations, TrafficWave.net will withhold and retain Customer account data for a period of 60 days. During this sixty day period, Customer may request reinstatement without the permanent loss of their service data, with the understanding that subscribers can still elect to have themselves removed at any time. Following this 60 day period, all data, files or other information that is stored in the Customer's account will be permanently removed. If the Customer wishes to use the services again, they will be required to re-enroll as a new customer.

Customer agrees that TrafficWave.net has the right to delete all data, files or other information that is stored in the Customer's account if/when the Customer's account is terminated, for any reason, by either TrafficWave.net or the Customer.

Customer accounts cannot be transferred or used by anyone other than Customer. Any evidence of accounts which have been transferred to other parties, or show other activity in violation of this paragraph, are subject to immediate termination without refund.

It is understood that TrafficWave.net will retain basic contact information to occasionally communicate or provide updates to Customer after cancellation with the intention of renewing their business relationship. However, Customer may expressly request upon cancellation request that all personal information be erased and any use of their personal data be stopped. Customer will additionally have the option to later remove themselves from any further communication or email updates by clicking a remove link in the footer of the received messages or by written request at the address below.

It is understood that the complete removal of personal data by TrafficWave.net after account termination will exclude any such data required for the sole purpose of complying with state, federal, and international laws, and will be retained until such compliance has been met.

Customers are prohibited from transmitting on or through any of TrafficWave.net's services, any material that is, in TrafficWave.net's sole discretion, unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous, or hateful, or that encourages conduct which would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any local, state, national or international law.
