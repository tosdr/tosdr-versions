1.2              Dorado Games offers online and mobile games and other services within the context of its technical and operational capabilities, with an average annual availability of over 90% (ninety percent). This does not include periods of time during which the use of online and mobile games and other services are interrupted or affected due to urgent technical reasons or required maintenance work. Dorado Games is not liable for these instances in accordance with the conditions of this contract. This also does not include periods of time in which Dorado Games' general servers or the servers of certain games do not allow online access due to reasons beyond Dorado Games' control (force majeure, third party responsibility, etc.).

1.3              Dorado Games continuously updates, changes, and develops its online and mobile games and other services at its own discretion. Users can therefore only participate in the respective online game, mobile game, or other offer in its respective form provided at any given time. Dorado Games retains the right to cease operating an online or mobile game or remove a specific service without explanation.

1.4              Online and mobile games and other services offered by Dorado Games are intended solely for the purpose of entertainment. The use of these games or services for business or commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.

1.5              Users are responsible for ensuring that their own software and hardware is suitable and up-to-date.

1.6              In addition to these general terms and conditions, any existing rules of the respective online or mobile game shall also apply. In the case of an inconsistency between these general terms and conditions and the rules of the game, the provisions of these general terms and conditions shall take precedence when settling the instance of contradiction. In addition, specific terms and conditions shall also apply to certain online or mobile games, specific versions and/or components of online or mobile games, and individual services offered on Dorado Games' websites as appropriate. Users will be appropriately informed of any specific terms and conditions prior to use of the respective offer.

1.7              Users have the opportunity to use the services of Dorado Games' contractual partners for various online and mobile games and other services. In these cases, a separate contract between the user and the respective contractual partner of Dorado Games shall be concluded. Users will be informed of this in an appropriate manner prior to concluding the contract.

1.8              Other provisions or general terms and conditions of a user, which deviate from Dorado Games' general terms and conditions, shall only apply if Dorado Games gives prior written consent to their validity.

In this regard, Dorado Games only provides users with the technical environment for an exchange of information. However, users do not have the right to claim communication features.

However, the user can pay money to purchase virtual currency (e.g. gold, jewels, or the like, also called the "premium currency"), certain virtual features, and other services (together with the "purchasable features") within the context of the online games and mobile games. The price for the desired virtual currency appears in euros, US dollars, or in another currency applicable to the user's region. The user can purchase services, advantages or virtual items in the online or mobile game with the premium currency purchased. These purchases are non-transferable and cannot be carried over to other games. Any type of virtual currency, as well as any form of associated services, advantages and virtual items are non-refundable.

7.2              Users will receive specific information on the features available for purchase, particularly the function of the feature in question, how long the feature for purchase will be available (if applicable), the respective purchasing price, and the payment method available in the online or mobile game.

7.3              Users can submit their offers to purchase the available features by selecting the desired item and desired payment method offered in the respective online game or mobile game, clicking on the “Buy” button, and thus concluding the order process.

7.4              The payment options vary according to the online or mobile game, the participant's country, and the technically feasible payment options available in the market. Dorado Games reserves the right to amend their payment options.

7.5               The money is collected via the service provider commissioned by the user for the respective payment process or via a transfer made by the user. For mobile games, money is collected via the respective app store. In individual cases, the general terms and conditions included by the authorized service provider may be applicable in addition to the general terms and conditions of Dorado Games.

7.6              After completion of the payment process or, in the case of a transfer, after the receipt of the money in Dorado Games' account, Dorado Games shall credit the purchased features to the user's account. The credit simultaneously represents that the user has accepted a contract from Dorado Games regarding the purchase of available features, and services.

7.7              In mobile games on the portals of individual business partners and in online and mobile games that have been integrated into social networks, the conclusion of the contract may deviate from the procedure described here. In these cases, users will be informed on the specific procedure for concluding a contract.

7.8              The user acknowledges and agrees that all information provided as part of a payment transaction (in particular bank account, credit card number, etc.) is complete and correct.

7.9              Dorado Games retains the right to revise the fees for features available for purchase. This includes Dorado Games' right to increase or decrease the fees for all individual features in all future cases of purchases of purchasable features.

8.1              Users are held personally liable for any violation of a third party's rights. Users agree to reimburse Dorado Games for all damages resulting from the culpable non-observance of the obligations of these terms and conditions. Users release Dorado Games from all eligible claims that other users or third parties may file against Dorado Games due to a violation of their rights by content posted by the user or due to a violation of other obligations. Users shall assume the costs of Dorado Games' legal defense, including all court and legal fees. This condition does not apply if the user is not responsible for the infringement.

8.2              The liability of Dorado Games, on whatever legal grounds, whether due to contractual misconduct or a breach of duty, is ultimately determined in accordance with the following rules:

8.2.1          If Dorado Games provides the respective liability-causing service free of charge, Dorado Games is liable only for malice and gross negligence.

8.2.2           In the case of non-gratuitous services, Dorado Games' liability is limited to cases of malice and gross negligence, but unlimited in cases of personal injury. In cases of slight negligence, however, Dorado Games will only be liable for a breach of essential contractual obligations such as delay or unavailability which Dorado Games is held responsible for. In the case of a breach of an essential contractual obligation, liability is limited to the typical contractual damages that Dorado Games had to calculate upon conclusion of the contract due to the circumstances prevailing at this time.

                    "Essential contractual obligations", as previously stated, are the obligations that may be relied upon by the user and that ensure that the contract runs in accordance with its regulations and achieves the contractual aim.

8.2.3          Dorado Games assumes no liability for interruptions within the network that are not the fault of Dorado Games.

8.2.4          Dorado Games is liable for a loss of data in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs only if such a loss could not have been avoided by adequate backup measures taken by the user.

8.2.5          The aforementioned liability limitations do not apply in cases of explicit guarantees made by Dorado Games, in cases of malice, and for damages due to the loss of life, limb, or health. Liability shall remain unaffected under the Product Liability Act.

                    h) the user culpably violates laws that serve to protect other players or Dorado Games

Moreover, Dorado Games is entitled to delete a user account at the end of the contract at its own discretion.

10               Governing law

10.1            The laws of the Republic of Malta shall apply to this contract and any and all contracts concluded subject to these Terms and Conditions, as well as any claims arising therefrom.

Users can only exercise a right of retention provided that it pertains to claims arising from this contract.

11.4            Dorado Games generally communicates with the user via email - unless indicated otherwise by these terms and conditions. Users need to ensure that they regularly check the email account specified at registration for messages from Dorado Games. When contacting Dorado Games, users must indicate which online or mobile game and which user account the message concerns.
