FreeDownloadManager.ORG collects and stores only the data explicitly provided by the users while making use of the Services, i.e. personal data specified in the user profile, network settings, cookies. If you use any of our client-applications or other applications developed by FreeDownloadManager.ORG or its subsidiaries and agents, the following information may also be collected: information about your operating system, the list of applications installed on it together with their version numbers, developers' names and app icons.

FreeDownloadManager.ORG uses personal data about its users only for the purpose of providing the Services intended.

FreeDownloadManager.ORG uses Flurry Analytics to collect data pertaining to user interaction with its client applications. These data only include information about your interaction with the interface elements and settings, and are only used by FreeDownloadManager.ORG to improve the Services. These data do not include personally identifiable information such as your location, age, location, etc. These data are not passed on to third parties.
