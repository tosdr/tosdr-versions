Privacy Policy

To execute the primary functions and provide the services intended, FreeDownloadManager.ORG, needs to collect some personal information about its clients. You may, however, rest assured that FreeDownloadManager.ORG respects your privacy and grants confidentiality for your personal data collected while working with your profiles.

FreeDownloadManager.ORG collects and stores only the data explicitly provided by the users while making use of the Services, i.e. personal data specified in the user profile, network settings, cookies.

Free Download Manager.ORG respect the privacy concerns of our users and offers an opportunity to inspect the information that is collected and stored by our Service. The users' profiles include tools and options for hiding information visible on their profiles.

FreeDownloadManager.ORG uses personal data about its users only for the purpose of providing the Services intended.

FreeDownloadManager.ORG uses Flurry Analytics to collect data pertaining to user interaction with its client applications. These data only include information about your interaction with the interface elements and settings, and are only used by FreeDownloadManager.ORG to improve the Services. These data do not include personally identifiable information such as your location, age, location, etc. These data are not passed on to third parties.
