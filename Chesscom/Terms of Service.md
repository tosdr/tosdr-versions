To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless expressly state otherwise.

In these Terms, **you** refers to Users (as defined below) of the Services and purchasers of Accounts (as defined below).

1\. Accounts, Passwords, and Payments
=====================================

A. Account Types
----------------

A User is capable of using some of our Services for free and also subscribe to become a member.A User does not need to be a Member to use our Services. A Member who subscribes to one of our Accounts is capable of using a larger portfolio of our Services which will depend on the the applicable Account subscription terms. The provisions of this policy apply to all Accounts.

### Member Accounts

Member Accounts are accounts offered by us, or through one of our affiliates, that are designed for home use and are not classified as another of the types of accounts mentioned in these Terms. A Member Account is available for use by one User.

### Gift Accounts

We offer the option of purchasing prepaid, nonrefundable, nontransferable access to a Member Account as a gift (**Gift Account**). See our [Gift Membership Service Policy](https://www.chess.com/legal/gifting) for the terms and conditions that apply.

B. Passwords and Account Access
-------------------------------

Every Account has one designated User who must be a person of lawful age under the laws applicable to the location in which the person resides and who can lawfully enter into a contract. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Account information. You agree that: (a) you will provide complete and accurate registration information about yourself and any individual you authorize to access your Account and keep your Account information up to date; (b) you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your Account; (c) you will notify us immediately of any unauthorized Account use; (d) we are in no way responsible for any loss that you may incur as a result of any unauthorized use of your Account and password; and (e) you will not sell, transfer, or assign your Account or any Account rights. If we learn that an ineligible User has created an Account, we may seek confirmation of the User's status or deactivate the Account, without notice to the ineligible User.

C. Account Registration
-----------------------

A User must register an Account by: (a) providing true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by our registration form; and (b) maintaining and promptly updating the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, then we will suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service.

D. Account Fees
---------------

For certain types of Accounts, we may charge a fee, such as an Account or subscription fee. All fees are due in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes due. We may offer promotional trial subscriptions to access the Services for free or at special discounted prices. If you sign up for a trial subscription, your rights to use the Services are limited by the terms of such trial and will terminate or renew according to the terms of your trial arrangement and/or any applicable Additional Terms. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds for existing subscribers in the event of a price drop or promotional offering for new subscribers. Failure to pay any fees may result in your inability to access or use the Services.

### (i) Authorization to Charge for Services

You must either use a credit card or other payment mechanism accepted by us (for example, PayPal, Apple's iTunes Store, etc.) (**Pay Mechanism**) to activate and maintain a paid Account. You authorize us to charge you through the Pay Mechanism that you use when registering for an Account. You will also be responsible for charges (including applicable taxes) for any products or services that you order that are offered for sale through the Services. All prices quoted for products or services are exclusive of tax, unless otherwise stated. Please note that we may take steps to verify your Pay Mechanism, which may include initiating a small (usually about $1.00 or so) authorization to your Pay Mechanism, even if you receive a free trial, which test authorization will be promptly reversed within the time period required by payment network rules. If we do not receive payment from the Pay Mechanism you use, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon our demand and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. Should the Pay Mechanism provided initially be declined for insufficient funds or any other reason, we reserve the right to attempt to recharge the Pay Mechanism in full or in lesser installments of the initially incurred charge for the duration of the Account subscription you selected and for up to an additional 90 days. You will not be charged more than the amount for which you purchased your Account subscription. You will be solely responsible for all overdraft fees and/or penalties that may be assessed by your payment provider. We use a third-party service provider to process payments on our behalf. You acknowledge and agree that in the event the third-party payment processor experiences a data breach that affects your information through no fault of ours we will in no way be responsible or liable to you for any such breach.

### (ii) Subscription and Renewal

By activating a Member Account, you agree that we may renew your subscription automatically for the same subscription term on the next day after your previous subscription ends. You authorize us to charge you for the subscription term, unless you cancel your Account prior to its renewal date through the procedures described in the **Subscription Cancellation** section below. We will charge you using the Pay Mechanism each year, month, or other applicable period (depending on the term that you selected) for the then-current applicable price.

### (iii) Subscription Cancellation

Unless you purchased your subscription(s) through the iTunes Store or the Amazon Appstore, to cancel any subscription and avoid future charges, you may cancel such subscription prior to its renewal date through the Account area on our Home Page or by contacting our Member Support Team. If you contact our Member Support Team, please know that we try to handle requests within 12-24 business hours; however, we cannot guarantee that your cancellation will be registered within that time. If you downloaded our app through the iTunes Store or Amazon Appstore, you must follow the cancellation instructions provided in the iTunes Store or Amazon Appstore, as applicable. For all Accounts, you will continue to have access to your Account for the time period that has been prepaid. After you cancel your Account, we will not charge you any subscription fees after the expiration of your then-current subscription. Please note that we do not provide full or partial refunds for prepaid sums. In any event, you will be able to continue to use the Services throughout the remainder of the subscription period for which you have already paid.

E. Promotional Codes
--------------------

We may, in our sole discretion, create Promotional Codes that can be redeemed for free time, discounts on our plans, gifts, Services or other features or benefits related to our Services.

6\. Governing Law
=================

THESE TERMS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF UTAH, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.

7\. Arbitration & Dispute Resolution
====================================

**THESE TERMS REQUIRE BOTH OF US TO ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTES WE HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WE BOTH WAIVE THE ABILITY TO BRING CLAIMS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN COURT, TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY, OR TO BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION FORMAT.**

**PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION & DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.**

**TO LEARN HOW TO OPT-OUT OF MANDATORY ARBITRATION, SEE SUB-PARAGRAPH F BELOW.**

If any controversy, allegation, or claim under any legal theory, including but not limited to any federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, including those based in tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or contract, arises out of or relates to the Services or these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, formation, or the validity thereof, and the issue of arbitrability (collectively, the **Dispute**), then we both agree to the following resolution process with respect to the Dispute. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, conscionability, severance, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the substantive law applicable to any arbitration, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

To resolve any Dispute most efficiently, we both agree to first discuss the Dispute informally for at least 30 days. To do so, the party who wants to raise the Dispute must first send to the other party a notice that must include (1) a description of the Dispute and (2) a proposed resolution (together, the **Dispute Notice**). If you want to raise a Dispute, then you must send your Dispute Notice by certified mail to the address listed below in Sub-Paragraph J). If we would like to subsequently discuss your Dispute Notice with you, we will contact you by using the contact information included with your Dispute Notice. If we want to raise a Dispute, then we will send our Dispute Notice to you at the email address that we have on file for you. If we do not have a valid email address on file for you, we will send our Dispute Notice to you through a means that complies with the service of process rules in the state of Utah.

If you and us do not reach an agreed-upon resolution within 30 days of receipt of the Dispute Notice, then we both agree that the Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (**AAA**). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. In resolving the Dispute, the arbitrator will consider applicable law, the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and any facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned decision. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within 60 days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,“ then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (**JAMS**), and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, using JAMS's Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service to which you and we consent. You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:

AAA: 800.778.7879 / JAMS: 800.352.5267

A. Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator will resolve the submitted Dispute and can issue a decision consistent with this Section 7. However, WITH ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY; THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES; AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. We both agree that any hearings held in the arbitration will be conducted virtually. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all such fees and costs in order for this Section 7 to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered into any court that has jurisdiction over the parties.

B. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded
------------------------------------

As an exception to binding arbitration, we both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court in Utah County, Utah, any Dispute that is within that court's jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. We will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual Dispute that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the Dispute is pending only in that court.

C. Injunctive Relief
--------------------

The foregoing provisions of this Section 7 will not apply to any legal action taken by either party to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in conjunction with any intellectual property claim or claim related to unauthorized access to data through the Services (including, but not limited to, claims related to patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets, and claims relating to the access or retrieval of data through the Services using an automated process such as scraping).

D. Timing of Claim
------------------

To help resolve any issues between you and us promptly and directly, you and the Company agree that any Dispute Notice must be sent, or that any small claims or injunctive relief complaint permitted under this Section 7 must be filed, within one year after the events giving rise to the Dispute arise; otherwise, the Dispute is waived.

E. No Class Actions.
--------------------

You and the Company agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. We both further agree that any Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. Also, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s).

F. Opt-out
----------

You can choose to reject this arbitration agreement by sending us a written opt-out notice (**Opt-Out Notice**) within 30 days following the date you first agree to these Terms, by you must mail or email your Opt-Out Notice to the address listed below in Sub-Paragraph J. If mailed, the Opt-Out Notice must be sent certified mail and post-marked no later than 30 days following the date you first agree to these Terms. To be effective, the Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address, and signature. If you opt-out of the arbitration agreement, then all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may enter with the Company.

G. Survival of Arbitration Agreement
------------------------------------

You and the Company agree that the agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of these Terms, and the termination of any membership or account you may have with Company.

H. Severance of Arbitration Agreement
-------------------------------------

If the arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this arbitration agreement's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any part of this agreement to arbitrate is deemed invalid or inapplicable, the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate shall still be considered valid and enforceable.

I. Alternative Dispute Resolution
---------------------------------

If your dispute pertains to a Chess.com finding that you violated its Fair Play Policy then, if you do not wish to submit it for arbitration with AAA, you may choose to submit it, instead, for final and binding arbitration with a Fair Play Panel of Experts. Chess.com shall enjoy the sole right to review any such claims submitted for resolution by the Fair Play Panel of Experts, and shall enjoy the right at its sole discretion to accept or reject any such claims for arbitration. If we reject such a claim for resolution by a Fair Play Panel of Experts, you still may use the Arbitration Procedure provided above.

This panel will conduct its hearing using AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by the Arbitration provisions in sub-paragraph C above.

Chess.com will pay all of the fees and costs associated with this Fair Play Panel proceeding (except for your attorney's fees). Both you and Chess.com will remain responsible for their own attorney's fees under all circumstances, no matter who prevails in this proceeding.

The Fair Play Panel will consist of three persons chosen by you and Chess.com from a panel of candidates, each of whom is either a recognized expert in the field of chess cheat detection or has obtained (and currently holds) at least the title of Chess International Master. The assembly and composition of a Fair Play Panel shall be entirely at the discretion of Chess.com and, by submitting to the jurisdiction of the Fair Play Panel, you agree that its decision shall be final and binding, with no opportunity for appeal unless Chess.com, in its sole discretion, elects to grant such an appeal.

We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the DMCA and other applicable law and are properly provided to us; provided that if there is Content associated with an NFT that is infringing, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such NFT from displaying the infringing content when connected to our Services.

If you believe that any Content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information:

* a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;
* identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
* identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (such as a url);
* your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
* a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

If you believe that your removed Content is not actually infringing, or that you have the necessary rights to post your Content, please send us a counter-notice containing the following information:

* a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;
* your physical or electronic signature (with your full legal name);
* identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
* a statement that you have a good faith belief, under penalty of perjury, that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and
* your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification of the alleged infringement.

If we receive a counter-notice, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the person alleging copyright infringement and inform that person that we may replace the removed Content. Unless the original person alleging copyright infringement files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member, or user, the removed Content may be replaced, in ten to fourteen business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Chess.com's sole discretion.

Please understand that filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.

We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, we also may terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.
