==============

Last updated: January 17, 2024

Welcome to Chess.com!

This Privacy Policy (“Policy“) outlines how Chess.com collects, uses, protects, and discloses personal information obtained from anyone who uses our Services (“Users“), anyone who creates an account on the Chess.com website or any related content, features, mobile and web applications and other services (collectively the “Services“) which are brought to you by Chess.com, LLC and its affiliate companies.

This Policy addresses requirements in the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA“), as well as any other applicable international, national, and state requirements related to data collection, usage practices, and disclosures.

**Please read this Policy closely**. By using the Services, you agree to the handling of your information in accordance with this Policy. If you provide us with your information (directly or indirectly through our service providers) we will treat your information according to this Policy. If we need to use your Personal Information for any other purpose, other than as disclosed herein, we will update this Policy or ask for your previous consent, if necessary.

Summary of Key Points
=====================

We encourage you to read this entire Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://www.chess.com/legal/user-agreement), but here are some key points that may be of your interest:

* Personal Information (“PI“) means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
* During registration, we may ask you to provide an email address, a username and if registration with a telephone number is available in your country, we will ask you to provide a telephone number.
* We will never ask you to provide us with sensitive PI.
* Paying Users are asked for payment information when they purchase anything from our Services. Please see Section “Information Collection“ for more information about how we safeguard payment information.
* Because the security of your PI is important to us, we only ask for PI where it serves a business purpose and try to limit the collection of PI to only what is necessary to accomplish those purposes. We also use commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative security measures designed to safeguard all information collected by the Services.

Chess.com is not targeted towards minors, meaning a person under the minimum age required to consent to the processing of their personal information as determined by applicable laws in their state or country of residence. Our platform at [ChessKid.com](https://chesskid.com/) is targeted towards minors.

3\. Information Collection
==========================

There are two general categories of information that we collect.

A. Information Users Provide to Us
----------------------------------

As more fully set forth below, we and our third-party service providers collect information that Users provide when using the Services, including when Users create an Account, sign up for Services, or contact us with a question, comment, or request.

To register an Account, Users are asked to provide a username, an email address, and/or telephone number (which is optional if you choose to register with an email).

Users are also able to complete their profile with additional information which is optional such as: first and last name, location, country, language, content language, timezone, OTB rating, status, profile picture and any other information the User chooses to share in the “About me“ section of the profile. The flag of the country you choose will appear on your profile.

Keep in mind that certain information from your profile is public and therefore can be accessed by any User, and even by people outside Chess.com. By including information in your profile, you understand that the information that is public can be used by any person or entity for their own purposes.

There is also other information provided that depends on the type of Account. For example:

Payment information such as credit or debit card information and billing address is collected from Users who purchase a subscription, including those who gift a paid Account to others, unless Users are purchasing through iTunes, PayPal, or other similar mechanisms with which we integrate. For your security, we do not store your credit card number in our databases but we and our payment service providers may retain only the first six digits and/or last four digits to identify your Account and respond to your requests and questions and to process the payment.

In addition, Users can provide us with information through separate sections of the Services. These sections, accessible via the Menu or Settings link on the Services, allow Users to administer their Accounts, including when they provide testimonials, seek customer support, or submit comments or questions.

If you submit any information relating to other people in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and permit us to use the information in accordance with this Policy.

When you contact us directly by any means we will collect your email address, name and any information you provide.

B. Information We Collect from Users
------------------------------------

We and our third-party service providers collect PI directly from Users of the Services in the form of the actions they take and activities they complete when using the Services. For example, from all Users, we may collect information about patterns of usage and order history.

We and our third-party service providers also use a variety of technologies, such as Cookies, to automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different websites.

We and our third-party service providers may use the information collected through these technical methods for several purposes, including delivering content, tracking and enhancing our Users' experience with the Services, and delivering advertising to visitors of our Services when they visit other websites and applications. For example, when you return to the Services after logging in, Cookies help the Services recognize who you are without having to log back in. More information about the use of Cookies is set forth below.

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

6\. How to Exercise your Right to Access, Change or Correct your Information
============================================================================

Any User can review or change the information they provided when they registered for the Services by updating the information on their Account profile or by contacting us at [support@chess.com](mailto:Support@chess.com). You also can exercise your right of access by requesting it on the “[My data](https://www.chess.com/my-data)“ Section of our Services. In addition, Users may contact us at any time as described in Section “Contact Us“ below, to request that we provide for their review any PI they have provided, or to cease collecting PI from the User.

When we change any PI at your request, we will make reasonable efforts to make the changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably practicable and always within the applicable legal term. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules.

7\. How to Exercise your Rights to Cancel and Delete your Account and How to Request Reactivation
=================================================================================================

Users may cancel their Accounts at any time by using the “[Manage Account](https://www.chess.com/settings/manage-account)“ section in the settings or by contacting support@chess.com.

Please bear in mind that after an Account is canceled, the PI and other Account information is not deleted permanently. We store the User information to allow the User to reopen their Account at any time. However, we provide no guarantee, and shall have no liability or obligation to ensure, that all Account Information and Services-related progress will be available or accessible or all learning or personalization features will be able to be recovered or resumed.

Upon Account cancellation or execution of a deletion request (as explained below), anonymized User information may nonetheless persist internally in our backup, archive files or similar databases, and may still be used anonymized, for our internal support, administrative, and record-keeping purposes including, but not limited to, allowing us to improve the Services and other services we provide through research, evaluation, and analytics as permissible by applicable law and for other purposes specifically outlined in this Policy. We may also keep certain information in backup or archive records if required by law or if it is relevant to preventing fraud or future violations of our policies or for legitimate business purposes when permitted by applicable law. All retained data will continue to be subject to our Policy in effect at that time

Following cancellation of an Account, to reactivate your Account and potentially recover previous information and resume where the relevant User left off you will need to request it to [support@chess.com](mailto:Support@chess.com) using the email address associated with your Account.

If you want to permanently delete your PI you can request it manually by clicking on “Delete“ on the “[My Data](https://www.chess.com/my-data)“ section of the Services or by requesting deletion to [support@chess.com](mailto:Support@chess.com). In this case, we will delete your PI, anonymize the information that will remain public such as games statistics, posts and comments, and block your email address and social media accounts from being used on Chess.com in the future.

If you want your posts and public comments to be removed, you must delete them separately before requesting deletion. After you delete your personal data, Chess.com Support Staff will have no means to verify your identity and will not remove these posts for you.

Any data deletion requests will be executed within the term provided by the applicable law.

Please keep in mind that a request to delete PI may lead to cancellation of your Account or the inability to use certain Services, and if any other Account type is linked to a Member Account, a request to delete PI in one of the Accounts may be reflected in your other Account.

8\. California Privacy Rights (CPRA)
====================================

This Section supplements the information contained in our Policy and applies solely to Users who reside in the State of California. We adopt this notice to comply with the CCPA. Any terms used in this Section have the same meaning as defined in the CCPA. Please note that we may claim legal exemptions for certain types of PI and certain of our Services from all or certain parts of the CCPA.

The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their PI. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. In this section “you“ or “your“ refers to California residents. Under the CCPA, we are required to disclose the categories of sources from whom we collect PI, and the third parties with whom we share it -- which we already have explained above in Section “Information Collection“, Section “How We Use Information“, and Section “When We Disclose Information to Third Parties“.

Only you as a California resident or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your PI.

The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected PI or an authorized representative. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your interactions with us. We will not otherwise ask for PI from you that we would not otherwise maintain as part of us providing our Services.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
* We cannot respond to your request or provide you with PI if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the PI relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an Account with us. We will only use PI provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

To exercise your rights you can always request it to us by sending an email to [support@chess.com](mailto:Support@chess.com) or by following the steps described below:

* **Right to access PI**. You may be entitled to receive information regarding the categories of PI we collected, the sources from which we collected PI, the purposes for which we collected and shared PI, the categories of PI that we share and the categories of third parties to whom the PI was shared with, and the categories of PI that we disclosed for a business purpose in the last 12 months. You can exercise this right by requesting it on the “[My data](https://www.chess.com/my-data)“ Section of our Services.
* **Right to data portability**. You may be entitled to receive a copy of your electronic PI in a readily usable format so you can transmit this data to another organization. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. You can exercise this right by requesting it on the “[My data](https://www.chess.com/my-data)“ Section of our Services.
* **Right to Correct**. You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate PI that we maintain about you. You are also able to correct any inaccurate PI manually by accessing your profile on the [Settings](https://www.chess.com/settings) sections of the Services.
* **Right to deletion**. You may be entitled to request that we delete the PI that we have collected from you. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request, in compliance with applicable laws. Please note, however, that we may need or be required to keep such information for our legitimate business purposes or to comply with applicable law. To know how to exercise your right to deletion, please refer to the section titled: “Account Cancellation and Reactivation; Data Deletion“ from this Policy.
* **Right to opt-out of certain sharing with third parties**. We do not sell your personal information to third-parties. We only disclose certain information to our service providers when it is necessary to fulfill our business purposes and in accordance with this Policy.

Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.
---------------------------------------------

Even though we do not share your information in exchange for compensation, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request us to not disclose your PI to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.

You can exercise such right to opt-out by submitting the following [form](https://go.chess.com/opt-out).

“Do Not Track“ Signals
----------------------

We do not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT“) signals received from web browsers. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.

You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. If you enable DNT functionality on any device, some of the Services, including paid Services or Chess.com subscriptions, may become unstable.

11\. Links to Other Services
============================

In certain sections of our Services, we may include links to third-party websites or applications (for example, Facebook and Twitter). These websites and applications are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours. We do not guarantee and are not responsible for the privacy or security of these websites, including the accuracy, completeness or reliability of information found on these websites. If you follow links to websites not affiliated or controlled by us, we encourage you to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of any external websites and apps, as those parties' practices would not be subject to this Policy.

12\. Location of Information Processing
=======================================

Our Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States. Your information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, including the United States, which may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country. In addition, your information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement officials in countries where it may be processed, under the laws of those countries.

13\. Security
=============

The security of your PI is important to us, and we employ physical, technical, and administrative security measures designed to safeguard the information collected by the Services. We use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer technology) encryption to transfer PI. Other security safeguards include, but are not limited to, data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to buildings and files. We also conduct periodic audits of our security (no less than annually) to apply best practices and reasonable industry standards. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. If there is a breach of our security, we will notify you where required by law or deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.

Account holders create a password in the registration process. You can help protect against unauthorized access to your Account and PI by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account. At registration, we assign a Member ID to each Account and use those Member IDs to authenticate logins, allow access to the subscription content, and monitor compliance. The Member ID is also used to authenticate users when requesting technical support. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two-factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions.

Some of the precautions we take to protect PI includes: (a) limiting employee access to PI to only those employees with a need to such access to fulfill their job responsibilities; (b) conducting background checks on our employees and, specifically, upon all employees that may have access to PI; (c) requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements upon hiring; (d) conducting regular employee privacy and data security training and education; and (e) protecting PI with commercially reasonable technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security safeguards.

Please be aware, however, that no information system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Services over networks that we do not control, including the internet and wireless networks. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is not secure, please contact us as described in Section “Contact Us“ below.

14\. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
==================================

We constantly try to provide the best services, and accordingly our Policy will change from time to time. If we substantially update this Policy, we will notify you by posting the revised Policy on our Services, and for certain revisions that materially expand the ways in which we use or share the information previously collected from you through the Services, either display an alert next to the Policy, display an alert upon login to the Services, or directly communicate with you (e.g. via our messaging service or the email address associated with your Account).

16\. Chess Play & Learn (Arcade Version)
========================================

This Section contains the provisions that only apply specifically to our mobile application known as Chess - Play & Learn (Arcade Version) (the “App“). This section is intended to complement the Policy above and it does not apply to our Sites or other Services.

Data Collection and Use
-----------------------

The App collects non-identifiable gameplay data to send to Apple iCloud, specifically to record a User's progress (win record) vs. the App's built-in roster of computer opponents. We do not store any of this data, but it is sent to Apple services (iCloud and Game Center) for storage and use.

The App also collects the User's anonymized Game Player ID for the App's “Online Play“ feature, where it is used to maintain a chess skill rating as online games are played. This helps ensure Users are matched with opponents of similar skill levels.
