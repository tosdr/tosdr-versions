We use n3rgy data service [(https://data.n3rgy.com)](https://data.n3rgy.com/) to interface with the national smart meter systems to collect, store, manage, and share your Smart Meter data with us. This service uses the Smart Energy Code [(https://smartenergycodecompany.co.uk/)](https://smartenergycodecompany.co.uk/)  Party credentials and Party ID of its parent, N3RGY LIMITED, incorporated and registered in England and Wales with the company number 11203504 whose registered office is at 4 Ovington Drive, Fleet, United Kingdom, GU51 1DF.

HUGO uses N3rgy data service ( https://data.n3rgy.com ) to interface with the national smart meter systems in order to collect, store, manage and share with **HUGO** your Smart Meter data. This service uses the Smart Energy Code  ([https://smartenergycodecompany.co.uk/](https://smartenergycodecompany.co.uk/))  Party credentials and Party ID of its parent, N3RGY LIMITED, incorporated and registered in England and Wales with the company number 11203504 whose registered office is at 4 Ovington Drive, Fleet, United Kingdom, GU51 1DF.

N3rgy Data Limited [(https://data.n3rgy.com)](https://data.n3rgy.com/) requests your consent to access, store and process your energy consumption, generation and tariff information. If you agree, the following information will be requested from your smart meter on a daily or more frequent basis.

* Energy consumption & generation information for both gas and electricity (where available).
* Energy tariff information contains information on the price you are charged for energy consumed.
* Information identifying the energy meter (number, location, type).

N3rgy Data Limited provides the service of gathering energy data for many businesses. Still, each time a company requests your data, you will be requested to consent to that specific company (and will be presented with this notice). The granularity of data gathered is at 30-minute intervals.

N3rgy Data Limited does not collect personal contact information and therefore relies on our Customers (the business you are currently consenting to) to agree with you the periods for which your data will be held and processed.

n3rgy data limited provides full visibility and control of the information you have shared with these businesses via a consumer portal [(https://data.n3rgy.com/consumer)](https://data.n3rgy.com/consumer) where you can:

* Review which organisations you have granted access to.
* Download a copy of your data held by n3rgy Data Limited.
* Withdraw consent for any or all of the organisations listed.\*

\* if consent is withdrawn from all organisations, N3rgy Data Limited will also remove your identifiable data from our platforms.

All consumption, generation and tariff information gathered by N3rgy Data Limited will also be cleared of all personally identifiable data (anonymised) and pooled within a data set made available to all organisations using the n3rgy data Limited service. This enables us, together with our customers, to better understand how we use, generate, and pay for energy, intending further to improve our nation’s energy efficiency and carbon reduction. Due to the nature of anonymisation, it is impossible to identify your data from this wider set and, therefore, to remove your contribution.

N3rgy Data Limited will use the Smart Energy Code (https://smartenergycodecompany.co.uk/) Party credentials and Party ID of its shareholder, N3RGY LIMITED, incorporated and registered in England and Wales with the company number 11203504, whose registered office is at 4 Ovington Drive, Fleet, United Kingdom, GU51 1DF.

Changes to these terms
----------------------

We may need to change these terms from time to time. We will give you at least 30 days’ notice of any change by sending you an SMS with details of the change or notifying you of a change when you next start the App.

If you do not accept the notified changes you may continue to use the App and the Service in accordance with the existing terms but certain new features may not be available to you, or you may not be permitted to continue to use the App and the Service.

No rights for third parties
---------------------------

This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.

Severability
------------

Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

Waiver
------

Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

Law and Jurisdiction
--------------------

These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts.

**Missions**

We may also share these results with 3rdparties we are working with to develop new products and services.

Winter Cashback Terms
=====================

Demand Flexibility Service
--------------------------

We and our partners are working with National Grid ESO, the people who run the electricity network, to trial the **National Grid’s Demand Flexibility Service (“NGDFS”)**, where households come together to use less energy at certain times – and get rewarded for their efforts. While your own home might only be a small drop in the ocean, every ocean is made up of many drops, so put enough of them together, and they soon add up.   Further details are available [here](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/electricity-explained/electricity-and-me/esos-demand-flexibility-service)

HUGO users can participate between November 2023 to 31st March 2024.

This means we will pay you to reduce your electricity demand during certain periods this winter  (“**Demand Events**“), mainly between 4-9 pm hours when electricity demand peaks and grid carbon intensity levels are highest. Payments will vary, but we will estimate the payment for reducing each kWh you would normally use. The expected value of the service will be around £3/kWh saved vs your normal consumption.   So if you would use 4 kWh during a Demand Event and end up using 2 kWh, the payment would be £6.   We will split the £3 with you on an 80% – 20% basis.   So you would get £2.40 per kWh (less any deductions for money transfer fees to make a payment to your bank account).   There will be a minimum of 12 Demand Events between November 2022 and March 2023, but there will likely be more.

You don’t have to participate in each one but only the ones that you find suitable.

How will it work?
-----------------

Press the **SETTINGS** button (top right) in HUGO and there is a **Winter Cashback** Opt-In toggle button.   Up to 24 hours before each **Demand Event,** we will notify you that a **Winter Cashback** period is starting.   When you get this notification via email, SMS or via the APP the Winter Cashback button will become activated and allow you to Opt-In.

Our notification will advise you of the time Demand Event and give you plenty of time to decide to take part and activate the Winter Cashback button. We will also try to sent a reminder message just before the start of the Demand Event.

If you’re taking part, we will read your smart meter data to measure your normal historic consumption (“Baseline Consumption”) and track how much you reduce demand during times when National Grid calls on the service.

HUGO and/or its Partners will calculate your **Baseline Consumption** using the BSC P376 ‘Utilising a Baseline Methodology to set Physical Notifications’ with an in-day adjustment for domestic customers. This methodology looks at up to 10 days of your recent smart meter history, excluding days where a Session has taken place, to calculate your average consumption.

Once we know how much **Winter Cashback** you have accumulated, this credit will be added to the HUGO app for you to review in the CO2 section.    You will need to reduce your demand by a minimum of 25% during a **Demand Event** to earn any **Winter Cashback** money.

If, for whatever reason, you don’t manage to reduce demand during the Demand Event, there are no penalties for not participating and no penalties for using more electricity during the Demand Event.

After each **Demand Event**, we and our partners will calculate how much you have reduced your **Baseline Consumption** by, during the **Demand Event**.   The results will appear in the running total in the HUGO CO2 section.

What can I do to reduce electricity demand during an event?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Here’s some great ideas for helping you get the most out of participating:

* If you use an electric oven / cooker, why not cook your dinner a bit earlier or later, or use a slow-cooker earlier in the day
* Turns lights down / off and have a candle-lit dinner
* Avoid using energy intensive appliances such as tumble driers, washing machines and dishwashers during the event
* If you have a heat-pump or electric heating, turn down your thermostat a few degrees for an hour
* If you have kids, get them off the TV and computer consoles for an hour and get some quality time back!
* Don’t charge your electric car at this time

**Rule of Participation for HUGO’s Winter Cashback Scheme**

**General**

These Terms and Conditions govern HUGO’s **Winter Cashback** Scheme (the “Scheme”). By entering the Scheme, you agree to be bound by the following Rules:

The trial will be run by HUGO TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED, a company registered in England and Wales with registered number 10551450 and registered office at 117a Blackbrook Lane, Bromley BR1 2LP (“HUGO”, “we”, “us”) and its Partner(s) who help HUGO administer the Scheme data with the National Grid ESO.

These Rules, together with any other rules notified by HUGO about this Scheme, are the Scheme rules (“Rules”) and apply to this Scheme. You are agreeing to be always bound by these Rules.

HUGO reserves the right to terminate, withdraw or amend the Scheme and/or the Rules without prior notice.    Any changes will be updated on our website.

If there is any dispute regarding the Scheme or the Rules, the decision of HUGO shall be final. We reserve the right not to notify you about our final decision.

**Scheme Participation:**

Only users of HUGO’s app ([www.hugoenergyapp.co.uk](http://www.hugoenergyapp.co.uk/)) are eligible to sign up to HUGO and take part in the Scheme.

To be eligible for the Scheme, you must:

* At all times complies with these Rules;
* be a successfully registered user of HUGO app
* has a working electricity smart meter which has been sending us 75% of smart meter reading for the past 3 weeks.
* has at least a full day’s worth of half-hourly readings
* register into the Scheme’s **Demand Event** during the registration window by turning on HUGO’s app **Winter Cashback** Opt-In button in HUGO’s app SETTINGS.
* is not taking part in the Demand Flexibility Scheme or related schemes with another provider or supplier.
* Consent to HUGO providing your smart energy data and Baseload Profile to its partners to assess the outcome of the **Demand Event**

The Scheme starts in November 2023 and will end on 31st March 2024 unless stated otherwise.

To partake, you must opt-in to the **Demand Event** before it begins and reduce your electricity demand from the grid by a minimum of 25% against your Baseload Profile as measured by us.

We will only register/count 1 Meter Point Administration Number (‘MPAN’) or 1 user per household.   If two people register for the Winter Cashback scheme from the same household using the same MPAN number, we will only pay 1 user, and the second or additional users will be deleted from that Demand Event.

If we’re unable to pull your meter readings to calculate your usage from any of the Sessions, we’ll work it out using an average across all Scheme participants. If at any point throughout the Scheme, you are no longer eligible, we reserve the right to remove you from the Scheme.

If your smart meter is not working during the Demand Event or you no longer live at the address you registered with the HUGO app, we reserve the right to remove you from the Scheme.

By entering the Scheme, you confirm that your information is up-to-date and accurate. If you provide any fraudulent or incorrectly completed information or if HUGO has reasonable grounds to believe that you have breached any of the Rules, HUGO reserves the right to disqualify you from the Scheme.

HUGO will not be liable to reimburse any expenses incurred with entering the Scheme and will not be liable for any errors or omissions in its decision-making or the decision-making of its Partners.  We will also deduct any money transfer fees or bank transfer fees from any money we send you from the Winter Cashback money owed to you when the Scheme ends.

If at any point you wish to opt out of the Scheme before the Demand Event, turn off the Winter Cashback opt-in button in the HUGO app SETTINGS.

**Data Protection and Publicity**

HUGO’s privacy policy shall apply to any data collected in connection with this Scheme and can be found on our website.

HUGO and its partners will share customers’ Meter Point Administration Numbers with National Grid ESO to register customers in the scheme and allocate payments to individual customers. HUGO and its Partners will provide National Grid ESO with half-hourly electricity consumption, baseline and reduction data, summed across all customers in each of the 14 GSP Groups, to deliver the Scheme. In rare cases, National Grid ESO may request detailed half-hourly data around the events to audit performance and payment, which may include consumption data on an individual customer basis. By entering the Scheme, you agree to your information being used as such.

HUGO, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to withdraw or vary the Rules and/or any offer made in connection with them to comply with the decision of any relevant judicial or regulatory body and shall not be held liable to any entrant for doing so.

**Missions**

From time-to-time Hugo will offer it’s customers the chance to participate in Missions and earn space credits. When a user reaches 100 space credits they will be given the chance to choose a reward from the Hugo Gift Shop ([https://hugoenergyapp.co.uk/hugo-gifts/](https://hugoenergyapp.co.uk/hugo-gifts/))

By participating in a Mission, you will be asked to complete a survey or questionnaire. We reserve the right to use the results and responses provided by you (excluding your personal details) to improve our products and services and create new products and services. We may also share these results with 3rdparties who we are working with to develop new products and services.
