* All personal data processed will be transferred to, and processed in the UK.  In some cases where you are having individual data issues and have raised this issue with us we will allow our partners to process your data outside the UK. These countries will have data protection laws that are different to the laws of the UK (and, in some cases may not be as protective). However, we have taken the appropriate measures to ensure your data is safeguarded and protected in each and every case it needs to be processed outside the UK.

**Third-Party Links**

Our service may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. Please note that these websites and any services accessible through them have their privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services, such as Contact and Location Data. Please check these policies before submitting personal data to these websites or using these services.

**Where We Store Your Personal Data**

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA).  It may also be processed by staff operating outside the UK or the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.  Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your booking, the delivery of a course, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.  By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

If you are a UK citizen based in the UK or an EU citizen based in the EEA, then whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK or the EEA (other than from the UK to the EEA), we will only transfer your personal data:

* to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
* where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK, which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK or
* if an appropriate safeguard has been put in place.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.

**Data Security**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In particular:

* we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know;
* all personal data is stored on secure servers;
* payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology; and
* we comply with any third party protocols relating to the supply and sharing of energy usage and SmartMeter data.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.  Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our service, and any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

* our legal and regulatory obligations,
* any relevant industry standards or codes,
* the nature and sensitivity of the personal data and
* the potential risk of harm from any unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction of or damage to the personal data.

In some circumstances, we will anonymise your data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

If you do not use your account for a period of \[2\] years then we will treat the account as expired and your data will be archived and may be deleted..

**Your Rights**

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.  You can exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at [support@hugoenergyapp.co.uk](mailto:smartdata@hugoenergyapp.co.uk)

You have various statutory rights in relation to your personal data. In particular, you have the right to:

However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

We reserve the right to request that you provide evidence of your identification if you ask us to carry out any steps in relation to your personal data.
