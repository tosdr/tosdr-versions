How Clients Can Modify Information
----------------------------------

**EUREKA** Sites may update or change their institution's information by contacting us, or in some cases, updating their records through the relevant areas of **EUREKA**. We also provide Sites with a dashboard that allows them to access, modify and delete student and client information, as may be required by law or otherwise deemed necessary from time to time.

**EUREKA** Users have the ability to access or modify their information.

On some pages of **EUREKA.org** or **EUREKAExpress.org**, you can order products or materials or make direct requests. The types of personally identifiable information collected on these pages may include your name, e-mail and phone number. **EUREKA** uses this information to fulfill your requests for products, services and materials, and to contact you about updates and new products. All business transactions are done through PayPal. **EUREKA** never collects credit/debit card information. **EUREKA** maintains commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personally identifiable information.

In order to do so, **EUREKA** may disclose certain of your personally identifiable information to necessary third parties **only**, such as **PayPal** and product suppliers.

Security
--------

We are committed to protecting the security, integrity and confidentiality of the data through the use of physical and technical safeguards. **EUREKA** uses a Dedicated Server hosted by Alentus, Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption and server authentication technology to protect data when **EUREKA** is accessed using a supported web browser.

We host Sites data in secure server environments that use a firewall and other industry-standard technology in an effort to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. We also require unique account identifiers, user names, and passwords that must be entered each time Users sign on to **EUREKA**. The Internet, however, is not perfectly secure and **EUREKA** is not responsible for security breaches not reasonably within its control.

We require that Sites maintain the confidentiality of their user names and passwords. If Sites become aware of any unauthorized use of an account, loss of their or their users' account credentials or suspect a security breach, notify us immediately.

Data Retention Policy
---------------------

As a system of record for its Clients, **EUREKA** retains the data at the sole discretion of Sites, and for as long as they have active subscriptions for **EUREKA**. After termination of an agreement, **EUREKA** will retain Site data for a limited time period in accordance with the **EUREKA** Data Retention Policy for the convenience of Sites, so that they may retain continuity of their experience should they choose to reengage with **EUREKA**. At the end of the data retention period, we securely delete and destroy personal information from Sites.

Sites have total control over their data from users and the duration of their accounts. The data will always remain under the direct control of the Sites and subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Notwithstanding the above, we do retain aggregated, de-identified data for the sites to use for statistical purposes.

EUREKA regularly deletes all personal information for cancelled accounts and sites, and will delete personal information upon request.

Under no circumstances does **EUREKA** sell private information to any concerns.

Opt-Out Policy
--------------

We send emails to individual contacts from Sites with information about our websites through Constant Contact. These individuals may opt out of receiving email messages at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link found at the bottom of every email that we send.

If Clients have opted out of receiving communications from us, we may still send essential communications to our primary contacts for **EUREKA** regarding any of their Site's accounts, such as password change messages.

We do not send email messages on behalf of third parties.

Updates to This Policy
----------------------

**EUREKA** may amend its privacy policy from time to time without advance notice to you. If **EUREKA** decides to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, **EUREKA** will notify you by way of an email. You will have a choice as to whether or not **EUREKA** may use your information in this different manner. Otherwise, **EUREKA** will use all personally identifiable information only in accordance with the privacy policy in effect when such information was collected. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, **EUREKA** reserves the right to use your personally identifiable information in cooperation with any state, local, and federal officials in any investigation relating to any Content (including personal or private electronic communication transmitted on **EUREKA.org** or **EUREKAExpress.org**) or purported unlawful activities of any user.
