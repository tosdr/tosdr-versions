As indicated in the chart above, we collect some types of personal information automatically when you use our Services. For example, we use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as web beacons) to collect and store information about your interactions with our website, including information about your browsing behavior. Our website also supports third-party cookies placed by our service providers and third parties, such as advertising partners.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**. Cookies are small files that a website transfers to your device through a web browser that enable the site’s or a third party’s systems to recognize your device and capture and remember certain information. Web beacons (also known as tracking pixels) are tiny graphics embedded invisibly on a webpage or in an email that may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages, and to understand usage patterns.

* Your personal information is reasonably necessary to manage our operations, to manage your relationship with us, or to satisfy another purpose for which we collected the information;
    
* Your personal information is reasonably necessary to carry out a disclosed purpose that is reasonably compatible with the context in which the personal information was collected;

#### CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

This section provides additional disclosures for California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “**CCPA**”). California job applicants can find applicable disclosures here \[link to CA Applicant Notice\].

**Sales and Sharing of Personal Information**. We do not sell personal information in exchange for money. However, some of the ways in which we share personal information for advertising, certain types of analytics, or with our franchisees and affiliates may be considered “sales” or “sharing” under California law. Listed below are the categories of personal information we share for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising or otherwise “sell,” as that term is defined under California law:

* Identifiers
    
* Personal Records
    
* Commercial information
    
* Internet or other electronic network activity information
    
* Geolocation Data
    
* Inferences
    

The types of third parties to which personal information is sold or shared are third-party advertisers, some analytics vendors, and our franchisees and affiliates. The purposes for which we sell/share this information include: showing you relevant ads while you browse to internet or use social media; marketing, advertising, certain types of analytics, or similar purposes; and providing operational, analytical, and other support for our franchisees. We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. We do not sell or share personal information obtained for text messaging purposes - including personal information obtained for opt-in consent purposes - with any third parties for those third parties' own marketing purposes.

California residents can opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information by clicking here: Cookie Settings  
You may also opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information through an opt-out preference signal, such as the Global Privacy Control. If you choose to use a browser-based opt-out signal, you will be opted out of cookie-based sales or sharing of personal information, and will need to turn it on for each browser you use. To submit a request to opt out of offline sales and sharing, please use our [webform](https://www.mathnasium.com/ccpa-request-form).

**Right to Know**. California residents have the right to request more information regarding:

* The categories of personal information we have collected about you, including:
    
    * The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected
        
    * Our business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information
        
    * The categories of recipients to which we disclose personal information
        
    * The categories of personal information that we sold, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to which we sold that particular category of personal information
        
    * The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of recipients to which we disclosed that particular category of personal information
        
* The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
    

**Right to Delete**. California residents have the right to request the deletion of personal information we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Where we use deidentification to satisfy a deletion request, we commit to maintaining and using the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information.

**Right to Correct**. If you believe that personal information we maintain about you is inaccurate, you may submit a request for us to correct that information. Upon receipt of a verifiable request to correct inaccurate personal information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the information as you direct.

**Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information**. We do not use sensitive personal information for purposes to which the right to limit use and disclosure applies under the CCPA.

**Submitting Requests Relating to Your Personal Information.** If you are a resident of California, you have the right to submit certain requests relating to your personal information as described above. To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through our [webform](https://www.mathnasium.com/ccpa-request-form) or call us at 877-601-MATH (6284). Please note that, if you submit a request to know, request to delete, or request to correct, you may be asked to log into your account (if you have one) or to provide 2-3 pieces of personal information that we will match against our records to verify your identity. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf; however, you will still need to verify your identity directly with us before your request can be processed. An authorized agent may submit a request on your behalf using the [webform](https://www.mathnasium.com/ccpa-request-form) or toll-free number listed above.

**Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights**. If you choose to exercise any of your privacy rights under the CCPA, you also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us.

**California’s Shine the Light Law**. California consumers may request a list of the third parties to which we have disclosed personal information, as defined under California Civil Code Section 1798.83(e) (a/k/a the “Shine the Light Law”), during the preceding calendar year for third-party direct marketing purposes.

We maintain separate websites for other countries in which we operate. Additional or different policies may apply. 

#### INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN

We do not knowingly collect personal information through our online Services from anyone under the age of 18 without first obtaining parental consent.

Similarly, if you interact with us through Social Features, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you “like” or “follow” our page on another website). Please note that if you mention or comment about Mathnasium or our Services in your post on a social media platform, that platform may allow us to publish your post on our Services.

#### EMAIL PREFERENCES

If you no longer want to receive our promotional email communications, you can unsubscribe by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link found in our commercial email messages. If you opt-out of our promotional emails, we may still send you email messages related to your account or any Services you request from us. Unsubscribing from our promotional emails will not affect the level or quality of service we provide to you.

#### Information About Online Chats

Our Services include online chat features to assist with answering questions and providing you with relevant information. When you participate in an interactive chat, either with a virtual or live agent, the contents of the chat may be captured and kept as a transcript. By using an online chat feature, you understand that our vendors may process the information obtained through the chat feature in order to provide services on our behalf.

#### DATA SECURITY

We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. Although we use reasonable efforts to safeguard information, transmission via the Internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Services.
