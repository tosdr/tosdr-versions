Other technologies
------------------

### Web beacons

We and any marketing companies we use also embed web beacons in our marketing emails or on our website. Web beacons are small GIF image files which enable us to track your receipt of our marketing emails, how often you view our adverts or website pages, your location, IP address and browser information. Web beacons are activated whenever you open a marketing email or access a page on our website which contains a web beacon. Web beacons transmit data when you view them but are not capable of accessing any other information on your computer. Web beacons are not stored on your hard drive unless you download a GIF image containing them.

Some (but not all) browsers enable you to restrict the use of web beacons by either preventing them from sending information back to their source (for example, when you choose browser settings that block cookies and trackers), or by not accessing the images containing them (for example, if you select a ‘do not display images (in emails)’ setting in your email server).

#### How to opt in or out

See the section below entitled How to accept or reject cookies

* **Legal basis for processing:** we process the information we gather from the use of web beacons in our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation).
* **Legitimate interest:** analysing the effectiveness of our email marketing campaigns or for our website.

### Facebook Pixel

We use Facebook Pixel on our website. Facebook Pixel is a tracking code which allows us to track and monitor the success of advertisements we use on Facebook and to improve the effectiveness of those advertisements by recording information such as the device you used to access our website and the actions you took on our website using cookies. We may also use Facebook Pixel to create retargeting advertisements and custom audiences for our advertisements on Facebook and on our website.

Facebook aggregates data gathered from our use of Facebook Pixel on our website with data it gathers from other sources, in order to improve and target advertisements displayed on its website or via its services, to improve its systems and to provide measurement services to third parties which use Facebook’s advertising services. You can find out more about how Facebook handles information they collect about you and other individuals by accessing their privacy policy, which is available here: [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy?guestId=D53wlgZfW1&swType=slide_callout&swId=41)

### Linkedin Tracking

LinkedIn conversion tracking is an analytical function powered by the LinkedIn Insight Tag. Conversions are actions a member makes that are valuable to your business. Conversion tracking gathers insights into post-click and view-through conversions of your LinkedIn ads campaigns, giving you the ability to measure the impact and ROI of your ads.

The LinkedIn Insight Tag is lightweight Javascript code that you place across your website. This tag drops a cookie on visitors’ web browsers when they visit your website. The Insight Tag shouldn’t cause additional time for the website page to load. Learn more about the [LinkedIn Insight Tag](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521?guestId=D53wlgZfW1&swType=slide_callout&swId=41).

For advertisers interested in tracking on-click events, there is also an event-specific image pixel option for conversion tracking.

For more information please view Linkedin [terms](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/conversion-tracking?guestId=D53wlgZfW1&swType=slide_callout&swId=41) and [cookie policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?guestId=D53wlgZfW1&swType=slide_callout&swId=41).

Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user.
