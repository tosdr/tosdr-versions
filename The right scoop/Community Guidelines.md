The Right Scoop Commenting Rules
================================

Any comments that fall within the following categories will most likely be deleted:

1. **Abusive, Ad Hominem, Overly Mean-Spirited.** Attack arguments and ideas, not people. And please refrain from wishing bodily harm, death, or illness on others. [Ad hominem arguments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) (in which one attacks a speaker to try and disqualify an argument’s validity) are not appreciated. A clarification on this point. If you want to comment that “Sean Hannity is an idiot” or “Barack Obama is a moron” that will probably be tolerated — though not particularly appreciated. What will not be tolerated is direct ad hominems toward The Right Scoop’s writers, editors, and commenters.

3. **Hyperbolic Nazi References.** Try not to compare people to Hitler and the Nazis unless they’re actually advocating anti-Semitism, racism, or genocide. [See Godwin’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law). These references usually poison debate and are indicative of intellectual laziness.

5. **Filled with profanity.** If you feel like an expletive helps make your point then just follow the first letter with a few stars. Censored profanity is acceptable.

7. **Disgusting.** Let’s avoid toilet humor and pornographic commentary. We’re not in third grade any more.

9. **Off topic.** The exception to this would be our “open threads” in which you can create your own topic for discussion.

11. **Ads or Spam.** Though we welcome you to post a link to your blog if you’re responding to one of our bloggers at your own site.

13. **Racist, sexist, and homophobic.** The Right Scoop takes a more realistic attitude toward what constitutes these concepts than leftist sites would. Being against one of President Obama’s policies is not racist. Being opposed to him because he’s half-black _is_ racist. Being against gay marriage is not homophobic. Suggesting that gays need to get AIDS and die is. Holocaust Denial will be considered Anti-Semitism and will not be tolerated.

15. **Duplicates**. Please do not copy and paste the exact same comment on multiple threads.

17. **Other Source Material**. Please do not post someone else’s source material such as a blog post or an article as your comment. You are more than welcome to provide a link to the article or blog post with a short summary or even a short quote, but posting other source material is prohibited.

19. **Threats.** If you threaten or intimidate another commenter, a post’s author, or a public figure then you will immediately be banned from posting on The Right Scoop and you will be reported to the proper authorities.

21. **COMMENTS THAT ARE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS OR ALL BOLDED** – THESE COMMENTS MIGHT BE DELETED BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THE FLOW OF THE COMMENT SECTION.

  

23. **[Internet Trolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_trolls).**
