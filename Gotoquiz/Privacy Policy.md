Privacy Policy
==============

GoToQuiz.com is committed to maintaining high standards of privacy for its visitors. This document describes the ways in which we respect visitor privacy.

### Information GoToQuiz stores:

Our server logs the visitor's IP address and certain browser headers as part of the standard logging proccess that most web sites follow. This data is stored only in log form and is used to generate aggregate reports on visitor use of the site. Information such as real names and e-mail addresses are not collected by simply visiting GoToQuiz.com, and in fact are not possible to collect without a visitor actually volunteering that information.

When taking quizzes at GoToQuiz.com, if you have not created a GoToQuiz account, no quiz results are linked to you in any way unless you have opted in. Answers to some questions may be logged only to generate aggregate reports, which may be made public. This data is anonymized. The quiz results of users with GoToQuiz accounts are saved and may be deleted upon request. Saved results are displayed to the quiz-makers, and are not used for marketing purposes.

We may collect personal information volunteered by the visitor through the use of HTML forms, and this might include surveys, site registrations, or other form posts.

### What GoToQuiz does with stored information:

Any information that is volunteered by a visitor is not shared with any third parties unless the visitor has given explicit permission to do so ("opt-in"). Internally, this information may be used to make personalized recommendations (such as quiz recommendations) or to adjust the advertisements that are shown.

### How GoToQuiz uses cookies:

Using GoToQuiz.com may result in a cookie being set, which is used to "remember" you from page to page. This is the essential function of HTTP cookies. In this case, it allows you to log in to a GoToQuiz account as well as for GoToQuiz.com to make personalized recommendations and show more accurate advertising offers to you during your visit.

It is possible for you to disable or modify the cookie feature in your browser by consulting your browser's "help" screen, looking up cookies, and following the directions. Be aware that disabling cookies will likely disable certain functionality on the sites you visit.
