Cookies policy
==============

We have updated our cookies policy on May 24th 2024. On this page, we will explain how Yle uses cookies and other similar technologies to process information about the use of Yle’s services. For more information on the processing of personal data in general, see [https://yle.fi/aihe/s/about-yle/privacy-statement-for-yles-services.](https://yle.fi/aihe/s/about-yle/privacy-statement-for-yles-services)

Cookies and other similar technologies
--------------------------------------

What are cookies?
-----------------

A cookie is a small user-specific text file sent to the customer's browser, which usually contains an identification number and does not damage the terminal device. Yle uses cookies ("cookies") and other similar technologies to provide the service you requested and to enable the use of Yle's digital services.

Cookies are collected information about the use of Yle’s content, such as which Yle pages the user has browsed. Cookies are used in order to make our website work better, to be able to provide the customer with the best user experience, and in order to enable visitor traffic statistics.

What information is collected with cookies?
-------------------------------------------

* Yle's content usage information and searches.
    
* The page, server and network identifier from which the user has moved to our pages,
    
* Device model, unique device and/or cookie identifier, data collection channel (internet browser, mobile browser, application), browser version, IP address, session identifier, session time and duration, and screen resolution and operating system.
    
* Country code where the content has been used
    

The user cannot be identified through cookies only. If the user has created an Yle ID, we can supplement the information related to the use of the services with the Yle ID information

Purposes for which the data are used
------------------------------------

Necessary cookies
-----------------

**Functional cookies**

We use functional cookies to provide the service you requested and to enable the basic functionality of the services.These functionalities include logging in, starting videos, and remembering user-specific settings

**Audience measurement**

Some of the strictly necessary cookies are used to measure the use of Yle services both internally and nationally. The use of Yle contents is measured by external independent research organisations. Research on the use of content is carried out by Finnpanel and FIAM (The Finnish Internet Audience Measurement).

**Yle ID contract-based cookies**

Yle ID contract-based cookies allow us to personalise Yle services. You can find the benefits of personalisation in the [Yle ID service description](https://yle.fi/aihe/s/yle-id/service-description). Cookies that are used to collect user history for providing the Yle ID service are essential to the execution of the agreement. Consequently, you will not be asked to provide separate consent for their use.

With the help of these cookies, information is collected about the use of Yle services on different devices. The information is stored in the usage history of the Yle ID, which can be viewed through the Yle ID account. Your usage history includes the choices you make in the service, e.g. favorite and topic selections, orders, consents and settings.

The contract-based cookie data of the Yle ID can be used in recommendations and in teaching the recommendation algorithm, as well as in the development of services belonging to the Yle ID, e.g. the logged-in user's experience in Yle Areena.

Cookies that require consent
----------------------------

Cookies to improve our services
-------------------------------

We develop our services every day. Service development cookies help us understand how our site's services are used and what is expected from the services. With the help of cookies and similar technologies, we can make Yle's services better. For example, we may test which option from the user interface, news title or image serves the customer best. We use service development cookies for website visitor measurement and use the information obtained with the cookie, e.g. yle.fi to edit the front page.

Cookies for social media embedding
----------------------------------

Yle’s websites and services provide links and connections to third-party websites. The third-party hosted plugins on the Yle sites are downloaded from the servers of these parties.

Through the social plugin, information about the user’s visit to the page is stored for the social media service provider. In some social media plugins, information about an individual user is only disclosed when the user is active, for example by sharing an article through a social media plugin.

Third party services or third-party applications on Yle’s websites and services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of use of that third party. In such cases, these social media service providers process the data as data controllers and, where applicable, as joint data controllers with Yle. Yle does not collect cookie information through social media plugins.

Customer’s chance to influence
------------------------------

The saving and collection of cookie data is based on the service user's consent or the Yle ID agreement. Users give their consent through the pop-up window in use in the Yle browser services or by making an Yle ID agreement. They can change their consent at any time by going to the top bar of Yle services, selecting “Menu” and “Cookie Settings” under it or by changing the settings in the [Yle ID information](https://tunnus.yle.fi/my-data).

Users are asked to give their consent for using cookies every 12 months. If Yle’s cookie classification changes (for example, a completely new purpose category will be introduced), we will ask all users for the permissions again.

As regards newsletters, the customer agrees that we store and collect cookie information in connection with the subscription of the newsletter. The user can unsubscribe to the letter at any time ([https://tunnus.yle.fi/newsletters](https://tunnus.yle.fi/newsletters)), in which case the storing and collection of cookie information will also stop.
