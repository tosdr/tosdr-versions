Terms of Service
----------------

Ninite is provided to you on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Your use of the service is at your sole risk.

The free version of Ninite is only licensed for home use and as a trial for Ninite Pro. If you get paid for running Ninite (like in an IT department, PC shop, managed service provider, school, non-volunteer helpdesk, etc.) you must upgrade to [Ninite Pro](https://ninite.com/pro).

Ninite Pro accounts and installers are good for one business/organization. Please don't share them more broadly.

For managed service providers or IT support firms it's fine to use one big account across multiple clients. Your firm is considered the one organization in that case.

Ninite installs third-party software. By using Ninite you certify that you have read and agree with the license agreements and restrictions of any software you install with Ninite. Ninite does not grant you any license to any third-party software available on Ninite or elsewhere, nor does Ninite guarantee the availability of any third-party software.

Please [send us an email](mailto:contact@ninite.com) if you have further questions.
