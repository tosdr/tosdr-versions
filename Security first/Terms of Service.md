### 1\. YOUR ACCESS TO THE APP

Your use of the App under these Terms is also subject to any terms, rules or policies of any app store provider and/or operator (“App Store Provider”) from whom you have downloaded the App (“App Store Terms”). In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any App Store Terms, the App Store Terms will prevail. You and we acknowledge and agree that the relevant App Store Provider is a third party beneficiary under these Terms and will have the right to enforce these Terms against you directly.

We and our service providers are responsible for any maintenance and support of the App and you acknowledge that any App Store Provider from whom you download the App is not under any obligation to you to carry out any maintenance and/or support for the App itself. You acknowledge that we are under no obligation to carry out maintenance and/or support of the App and do so entirely at our discretion.

These Terms apply to the App including any updates or supplements to the App, unless such updates or supplements are accompanied by separate terms, in which case those terms apply. We may change these Terms at any time by notifying you of a change when you next start the App. The updated Terms will be displayed on-screen and you will be required to agree to them to continue your use of the App. The date these Terms were last updated appears at the bottom of these Terms.

From time to time we may issue updates to the App. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the App until you have downloaded and installed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms. Some updates may not be available to certain models of device. In order to use the App, you may be required to obtain certain updates and/or upgrades to your device. You are responsible for any costs and/or fees associated with any such updates/upgrades. You also understand and accept that: (a) the device you use to access the App will require certain software in order for the App to work correctly and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the required up-to-date software, and (b) the App has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the functionality of the App meets your requirements.

You may only download and install the App onto a device that you own, or if you do not own the device, you must have the permission from the owner(s) to do so. You accept responsibility under these Terms for the use of the App, whether or not you own the device onto which the App is downloaded and installed. You also acknowledge that the owner(s) of the device onto which the App is installed may be charged by any relevant mobile network operator and/or internet service provider in relation to any data and/or mobile connectivity used by the App.

Access to the App may be suspended temporarily and without notice: (a) in the case of system failure, (b) for maintenance or repair, © where we reasonably suspect there has been a breach of these Terms, (d) for reasons beyond our control, or (e) as otherwise explained in these Terms.

### 2\. PERMITTED USE AND RESTRICTIONS

Notwithstanding the above, the use, reproduction and distribution of components of the App licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3) license and terms are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license.

### 3\. SECURITY AND PASSWORDS

If you create a password or any other authentication information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential. You must not disclose it to anyone else and must take appropriate steps to keep your information secure by not using an obvious password and ensuring that you keep your password confidential and change it regularly. If you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your password or any other authentication information, you should promptly notify us using the contact details below. You are entirely responsible for all activities that occur through use of your password. We are not responsible for any losses or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any unauthorised use of the App.

We do not have any access to your password or the data held in your App. In the event that you forget your password you will be required to delete the App, reinstall it and set up a new password in order to regain access to the App. As a security precaution, resetting the App will wipe your data.

If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

Each of the conditions of these Terms operates separately.

### 1\. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW WE USE IT

We may collect and process the following information about you:

**Submitted Information**

We do not collect any information about you when downloading or using the App. Though the use of a 3rd Party App store (such as Google Play) to download the app means they may be able to track certain information about you.

We do not track your location. If you request information from the dashboard on an area, you simply submit the location you are interested in. The most specific information the App collects is to country level. The only information collected is an anonymised country code and time of request log. We do this so that we can pull the updated data from the external provider site.

The only instance in which we collect personal information about you is if report a problem. If you choose to report a problem with the App we will store the complaint and message data submitted. This kind of information may include your name and email address and other contact details. We use this information to make note of reoccurring problems and to enable us to provide a good level of customer service.

### 2\. WHERE WE STORE YOUR ANONYMISED REQUESTS

The anonymised information that we do collect is stored in the Republic of Ireland.

### 3\. PASSWORDS AND SECURITY

We recommend you use a password. If you want to save your checklists and keep an eye on your progress, we recommend you put a password on the app. This will encrypt the app. If someone gets their hands on your phone you don’t want them knowing which security protocols you’ve implemented and which you haven’t. We haven’t made this compulsory in case you weren’t storing much, but we think you’re better safe than sorry. You are entirely responsible for all activities that occur through use of your password, even if another person was using your account at the relevant time. We are not responsible for any losses or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any unauthorised use of the App.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted via the App; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your anonymised information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### 4\. DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION

We do not hold any personally identifiable information about you. We will only disclose any anonymised information to third parties: (a) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request, (b) if it is necessary to investigate any potential breaches or enforce any part of the Terms or other agreements or © to protect the rights, property or safety of GSF, our users, or others.

Whenever you make use of a feature that allows you to share any User Content with others, please note that such User Content will fall under the same security risks as general communications and could be read, collected or used by others. When you use these features, you must ensure that you do not submit any personal information that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users. We are not responsible for personal information that you have made available to other users.

### 5\. THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES

Your use of the App will also be subject to the privacy policies of any app store provider and/or operator (“App Store Provider”) from whom you have downloaded the App (“App Store Policies”). The App may also contain links to other third party websites and services (“Third Party Sites and Services”). The links to Third Party Sites and Services are provided for your convenience only. Your use of the Third Party Sites and Services will be governed by their terms and conditions and privacy policies (if any) (“Third Party Terms”). It is your responsibility to read the Third Party Terms. You acknowledge that we have no control over the Third Party Sites and Services and are not responsible for them.

### 6\. CANCELLING YOUR ACCOUNT

You can cancel your \[user account\] at any time by uninstalling the App. We will not have any personal information to hold about you.

### 7\. ACCESS TO INFORMATION

You have a legal right to access information we hold about you. Any access request you make may be subject to a fee of £1 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

### 8\. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY

We may change this policy at any time by notifying you of a change when you next start the App. The new policy will be displayed on-screen and you will be required to agree to it to continue your use of the App. The date this policy was last updated appears at the bottom.
