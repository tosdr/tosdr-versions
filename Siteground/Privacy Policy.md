We will disclose any such use on the respective webpage where the AI models and tools are integrated. In the course of using the AI models and tools integrated into our Services, we will not disclose any personal data to the third-party providers of AI models and tools. Although we take all necessary and reasonable care to obfuscate/anonymize any personal data before sharing any information with the third-party AI models and tool providers, we strongly advise you not to include any personal data in the AI tools integrated into our Services. 

2. To resell products and/or services of our contractors and comply with their applicable rules, regulations, and policies - When we act as resellers of products and/or services of our contractors (e.g. domain name registrars, SSL certificate providers, etc.), we may share your personal information contained in the respective order for the purchase of the products/services with these contractors to provide the respective services or products. The contractors further process the personal data shared following their privacy policies and practices. 
    
3. To comply with the applicable legislation and to exercise rights - We may share personal data with companies, organisations or individuals when we believe in good-faith that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such data is necessary to meet any applicable law, comply with regulations, legal procedures, enforceable requests and/or competent authority requirements; to enforce our terms, defend against claims and protect the rights, property or safety of SiteGround, our Customers and/or the public as required and/or permitted by law.

**VI. International data transfers**

1. Transfers between the UK and the EU/EEA
    

When transferring personal data from the UK to the EU/EEA we rely on the data adequacy granted to the EU/EEA by the UK government. For data that flows from the EU/EEA to the UK we rely on the adequacy decisions of the European Commission in relation to the UK. This means that the EU and the UK have both determined each region’s data protection laws to be sufficiently robust to ensure data can safely flow between the UK and the EU/EEA.

2. Transfers outside the UK and the EU/EEA
    

In the event that we transfer personal data from the EU/EEA and/or the UK, we will use the appropriate transfer mechanisms to ensure that the transfer is in compliance with applicable data protection legislation. Such mechanism shall be transferring the personal data: (i) to a recipient in a country covered by the UK adequacy regulations; or (ii) to a recipient that has executed the Standard Contractual Clauses, approved by the European Commission (when the data subject is located in the EU/EEA) or the International Data Transfer Agreement, issued by the competent authority in the UK (when the data subject is located in the UK).

In all cases we will ensure that we have provided appropriate and proportional technical and organisational data protection and cybersecurity risk mitigation measures, as well as we have performed the appropriate risk assessments when transferring your personal data outside the EU/EEA and the UK.

  

 **VII. Security measures**

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to encrypt the information you enter on our Site in order to protect its security during transmission to and from our Site. When storing information, we protect its security by encrypting critical data. Access to this information is severely restricted, logged and reviewed periodically. When we collect credit card data and payments (we do not store full credit card numbers and CVV codes), the credit card data is subject to tokenization and strong security measures applied by our payment processors in accordance with the PCI DSS requirements.

We maintain physical, logical, electronic and procedural safeguards when collecting, storing and disclosing personal data. Our security procedures require us in some cases to request proof of identity before disclosing personal data to you.

To protect against unauthorised access to your account and information, we implement session management, strong authentication requirements, login expiration mechanisms and the option of using 2-factor authentication for Client Area access. Authentication data is encrypted. As an additional safety measure, we ask you to sign out when you finish using your account and your computer. 

Although we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to maintain the safety and security of your personal data against loss, theft and unauthorised use, access or modification, please note that no transmission of information over the Internet is completely secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot fully guarantee the security of any personal data that you transfer over the Internet to us.

  

**VIII. Retention periods**

Information collected on our Site will only be retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. In general, we will automatically and securely delete your Client Area account information 2 years after you no longer have any active Services with us. Since we need to comply with applicable regulations in regard to retention of personal information related to contractual agreements, provision of Services, financial, billing, invoicing operations, tax calculations etc., a versioned copy of your order, payment and billing documentation may be stored for a period of 10 years after the termination of your Customer account. Your personal data is deleted automatically by our systems in accordance with these retention periods.

SiteGround California Consumer Privacy Act Addendum
===================================================

This Addendum supplements the information contained in the SiteGround Privacy Policy and applies to Website visitors, Customers, Users, Registrants, End Users, Affiliates and other individuals (incl. households) who are residents of the State of California, USA (“**consumer**”, “**you**”, “**your**”).

For avoidance of doubt, the term “data subject” used in the Privacy Policy shall correspond to the term “consumer” used herein and the term “personal data” in the Privacy Policy shall be equivalent to the term “personal information” used herein. All other terms which are not explicitly defined in this Addendum shall have the meaning as set forth in the Privacy Policy. 

This Addendum is drafted in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), together hereinafter referred to as the “CCPA”, and other relevant California privacy laws and its purpose is to provide additional privacy disclosures and to inform you of your additional rights as a California resident.

### **I. Categories of personal information we collect**

We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer (“personal information”).

Section I (“Categories of data subjects and types of personal data”) of the Privacy Policy describes in detail what categories of personal information we have collected from consumers within the last twelve (12) months.

**Sensitive personal information**

Some of the personal information we collect may be considered “sensitive” within the meaning of Section 1798.140 (ae) of the CCPA. We may collect the following sensitive personal information: social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number; account log-in information; debit card or credit card number; contents of a consumer’s mail, email, and text messages unless we are the intended recipient of the communication.

### **II. Sources of personal information collection**

Apart from you, being the main source of information we collect about you, we may also collect personal information from publicly accessible sources (e.g. companies trade register, WHOIS, local national list(s) of sanctioned persons) and/or third parties, such as our affiliates, trusted partners, including but not limited to marketing, advertising, security service providers, etc.

### III. Purposes for collection of personal information, incl. sensitive personal information

The business and commercial purposes for which we collect, use and disclose personal information, incl. sensitive personal information about consumers are described in detail in Section III (“Purposes of and legal basis for data processing”) of the Privacy Policy.

### IV. Disclosing of personal information to third parties

We may disclose personal information to the categories of third parties and for the disclosure purposes as set forth in Section V (“Sharing of personal data”) of the Privacy Policy.

### V. Data retention periods

The periods for which we retain your personal information are described in Section VIII (“Retention periods”) of the Privacy Policy.

### VI. Sale and share of personal information 

**In the course of provision of our Services we do not sell any personal information related to consumers.**

SiteGround has taken substantial steps to identify whether any of our activities as well as our data sharing arrangements would constitute a “sale” or “share” under the CCPA. Due to the complexities and ambiguities in the CCPA, we evaluate some of our third-party relationships periodically.

Under the CCPA, “sell,” “selling,” “sale,” or “sold,’’ means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. Therefore, it does not necessarily mean money was exchanged for the transfer of personal information, but the transfer may still be considered a “sale”. “Share” is defined as sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, including transactions between a business and a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising for the benefit of a business in which no money is exchanged.

### VII. Consumer rights under the CCPA

The CCPA provides consumers with specific rights with respect to their personal information as follows:

1. **Right to opt-out from sale or share of personal information**
    

A consumer shall have the right, at any time, to direct SiteGround not to sell or share the consumer’s personal information (“the right to opt-out”). Such a request of the consumer shall be respected for at least twelve (12) months before requesting that the consumer authorizes again the sale or share of the consumer’s personal information. In order to process the consumer’s request, SiteGround may use any personal information collected from the consumer in connection with the submission of the consumer’s opt-out request solely for the purposes of complying with the opt-out request. 

To exercise your right to opt-out from sale or share or any other right under the CCPA, you may submit a request at any time via email to dpo@siteground.co.uk. At a minimum, you must provide us with your names and email address you have used when engaging with us. We reserve the right to request additional information in order to identify you and process your request. We will keep a record of this request. Please note that we will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

2. **Right to know request. Right to access and data portability**
    

Pursuant to the CCPA, you have a right to request information about the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information performed by SiteGround over the preceding twelve (12) months, as well as to ask to provide you with these specific information:

* Categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;
* Categories of sources from which we collect personal information about you;
* Purposes for collecting, using, selling or sharing personal information;
* Categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;

### VIII. Exercising your rights

If you wish to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, please submit your request to the following email address: [dpo@siteground.co.uk](mailto:dpo@siteground.co.uk).

As per the CCPA SiteGround shall take into consideration the following requirements when answering a consumer’s request:

* The consumer shall place a verifiable consumer request. SiteGround is not obliged to respond to the request if it cannot verify that the consumer making the request is the consumer about whom SiteGround has collected information or is a person authorised by the consumer to act on consumer’s behalf; 
* The consumer may also designate an authorised agent to make a request on his/her behalf;
* SiteGround shall respond to the request within 45 (forty-five) days of receiving it. The time period for response may be extended once by an additional 45 (forty-five) days when reasonably necessary, and upon notification to the consumer.

With respect to your right to know and data portability - SiteGround is obliged to provide the required information no more than twice in 12 (twelve) months. The provision of information by SiteGround is generally free of charge. The disclosure shall cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request and shall be made in writing and delivered through the consumer’s Client Area, if the consumer maintains an account with us, or by mail or electronically at the consumer’s option if the consumer does not maintain an account with us, in a readily useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information from one entity to another without hindrance. SiteGround may require authentication of the consumer that is reasonable in light of the nature of the personal information requested, but shall not require the consumer to create an account in order to make a verifiable consumer request. If the consumer maintains an account with SiteGround, we may require the consumer to submit the request through its Client Area.
