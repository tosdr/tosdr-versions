**VI. Sale and share of personal information** 

**In the course of provision of our Services we do not sell any personal information related to consumers.**

SiteGround has taken substantial steps to identify whether any of our activities as well as our data sharing arrangements would constitute a “sale” or “share” under the CCPA. Due to the complexities and ambiguities in the CCPA, we evaluate some of our third-party relationships periodically.

Under the CCPA, “sell,” “selling,” “sale,” or “sold,’’ means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. Therefore, it does not necessarily mean money was exchanged for the transfer of personal information, but the transfer may still be considered a “sale”. “Share” is defined as sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, including transactions between a business and a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising for the benefit of a business in which no money is exchanged.

**VII. Consumer rights under the CCPA**

The CCPA provides consumers with specific rights with respect to their personal information as follows:

1. **Right to opt-out from sale or share of personal information**
    

A consumer shall have the right, at any time, to direct SiteGround not to sell or share the consumer’s personal information (“the right to opt-out”). Such a request of the consumer shall be respected for at least twelve (12) months before requesting that the consumer authorizes again the sale or share of the consumer’s personal information. In order to process the consumer’s request, SiteGround may use any personal information collected from the consumer in connection with the submission of the consumer’s opt-out request solely for the purposes of complying with the opt-out request. 

The opt-out right may be exercised at the following link: [“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”.](https://www.siteground.com/viewtos/ccpa_rights_center)

2. **Right to know request. Right to access and data portability**
    

Pursuant to the CCPA, you have a right to request information about the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information performed by SiteGround over the preceding twelve (12) months, as well as to ask to provide you with these specific information:

* Categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;
    
* Categories of sources from which we collect personal information about you;
    
* Purposes for collecting, using, selling or sharing personal information;
    
* Categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information;
    
* If applicable, categories of personal information sold, shared or disclosed about you and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold, shared or disclosed, by category or categories of personal information for each category of third parties to whom the personal information was sold.
    

3. **Right to delete request** 
    

You have a right to request that we delete a part of or all your personal information, subject to certain exceptions (i.e., when the information is necessary to: complete a transition or provide a service requested by you; debug or repair expected product functionality; detect or investigate cyber threats, etc.). Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

4. **Right to correct inaccurate personal information** 
    

You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies in the personal information we have collected about you, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.

5. **Right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information.** 
    

The CCPA grants you the right to instruct a business to limit its use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information to that use which is necessary to perform the services reasonably expected by you in your request for those services and to perform certain activities permitted by the CCPA. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes other than those necessary to provide you with our services or as permitted by the CCPA.

6. **Right to remain non-discriminated**
    

SiteGround shall not discriminate against a consumer because the latter exercised any of the consumer’s rights under the CCPA, including, but not limited to, by:

* Denying any services to the consumer;
    
* Charging different prices or rates for services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; 
    
* Providing a different level or quality of services to the consumer; 
    
* Suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services.

As per the CCPA SiteGround shall take into consideration the following requirements when answering a consumer’s request:

* The consumer shall place a verifiable consumer request. SiteGround is not obliged to respond to the request if it cannot verify that the consumer making the request is the consumer about whom SiteGround has collected information or is a person authorized by the consumer to act on consumer’s behalf; 
    
* The consumer may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on his/her behalf;
    
* SiteGround shall respond to the request within 45 (forty-five) days of receiving it. The time period for response may be extended once by an additional 45 (forty-five) days when reasonably necessary, and upon notification to the consumer.
    

With respect to your right to know and data portability - SiteGround is obliged to provide the required information no more than twice in 12 (twelve) months. The provision of information by SiteGround is generally free of charge. The disclosure shall cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request and shall be made in writing and delivered through the consumer’s Client Area, if the consumer maintains an account with us, or by mail or electronically at the consumer’s option if the consumer does not maintain an account with us, in a readily useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information from one entity to another without hindrance. SiteGround may require authentication of the consumer that is reasonable in light of the nature of the personal information requested, but shall not require the consumer to create an account in order to make a verifiable consumer request. If the consumer maintains an account with SiteGround, we may require the consumer to submit the request through its Client Area.

If you wish to exercise any of your rights under the TDPSA, please submit your request to our email address: [privacy@siteground.com](mailto:privacy@siteground.com) or via the contact form available at our website in the “Contact us” Section.

As per the TDPSA SiteGround shall take into consideration the following requirements when answering a consumer’s request:

* A consumer is entitled to exercise the rights authorized by Section IV above at any time by submitting a request to us specifying the rights that the consumer wishes to exercise. If we are unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts, we shall not be required to comply with the consumer request and may request that the consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer’s request.
    
* SiteGround shall respond to the request without undue delay, which may not be later than the 45th day after the date of the receipt of the request. The response period may be extended by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, upon notification to the consumer within the initial 45-day response period, together with the reason for the extension.
    
* SiteGround shall provide information in response to the consumer request free of charge, at least twice annually.
