[Home](https://www.bft.org/)\>Privacy Policy

BFT's Privacy Policy
--------------------

Thank you for visiting the Ben Franklin Transit (BFT) website and reviewing our Privacy Policy. Your privacy is one of our top priorities. We view this Privacy Policy as a privacy partnership between BFT and you, our valued customer. The following policy applies only to the use of BFT’s website. Other websites operated have different policies. We strongly suggest that you read the privacy policy for each website that you visit, and any external site that you visit through a link appearing on this site.

We seek to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible. However, because some of the information we receive through this website is subject to the [Washington State Public Records Law](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=40), and due to the nature of Internet communications, we cannot ensure absolute privacy.

**Use of This Website by Minors**

BFT does not intend to collect information from individuals who identify themselves as under eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under eighteen (18), you should not provide information on this website and should ask your parent or authorized guardian to do so for you. BFT will not collect information from those individuals who identify themselves as less than eighteen (18) years of age without verifiable consent from a parent or other authorized guardian.

**Questions of Concerns**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how your personal information is used, please write to us at BFT, 1000 Columbia Park Trail, Richland, WA, 99352, Attention: Customer Service.

**Does BFT Share the Information with Anyone?**

Unless a user consents to such distribution, BFT Will not sell, lease, or give away personally identifiable information to other governments, organizations, or private businesses within the limits of the law.

It’s important to know the law, as state and federal laws place a special burden on public entities such as BFT to assure the public’s right to access public records and information. Public information (as opposed to private information) involves information about activity that is regulated. For example, in purchasing a birth certificate online, a person’s name and birth date is public information (because births are regulated by the state), but the fact that you bought it with a certain credit card number is not (because means of purchasing is not regulated). Furthermore, public information would include correspondence with other agencies, including e-mails and website comments about shared processes, policies, activities, and other types of general correspondence. However, certain subjects fall under exemptions of the state’s public disclosure act, including employee benefit questions, welfare information, and other types of client specific data.

For details, see [Revised Code of Washington 42.56.070](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070), Documents and Indexes to be made public and the federal [Freedom of Information Act](http://www.justice.gov/oip).

Outside of legal requirements and extreme emergencies, information on the BFT website will not be released to anyone without the consent of the user.

Although we have put in place security systems (as described in this Policy) that are designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of your personally identifiable information, due to the nature of Internet technologies we cannot provide firm assurances as to the security of this information, and expressly disclaim any such obligation.
