Terms of Use
============

Looking for privacy policy? [Click this.](https://commuapp.fi/en/privacy-policy)

By using the service provided by Commu (Ronsam Digital Oy, Business ID: 3168016-8, hereinafter also referred to as “Commu”), you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”) and undertake to comply with them. Please read the Terms of Use described in more detail below carefully before using the Service.

### **General information**

“Commu Service” or “Service” means the digital application offered by Commu to natural and legal persons, the Commu website ([commuapp.fi](http://commuapp.fi/)) and other related services offered by Commu. 

In order to use the service or any part thereof provided by Commu, the User must first have read, understood and accepted the terms and conditions of the Terms of Use. By accepting the Terms of Use, registering as a user of Commu, downloading the Service application or otherwise accessing the Commu Service, you confirm that you understand and accept these Terms of Use.

In addition to the Terms of Use, Commu has a separate set of [Community Guidelines](https://commuapp.fi/en/community-guidelines). As a User, you undertake to be aware of the Community Guidelines in force at any given time and to familiarise yourself with any changes to them. The [Community Guidelines](https://commuapp.fi/en/community-guidelines) is a living document and may be updated by Commu more freely than the Terms of Use, provided that, at the latest when using the application, the user is notified of any new changes to the [Community Guidelines](https://commuapp.fi/en/community-guidelines). 

Commu reserves the right to make changes to the Terms of Use. If the Terms of Use are changed, Commu will indicate the changes made in the remainder of the Terms of Use, stating when the change was made (with the date). The revision of the Terms of Use will take effect at the earliest when:

1. a) Seven (7) days have passed since the change; or
2. b) You are using the service for the first time after the change to the Terms of Use.

If you do not accept the Terms of Use, you are not entitled to use or be involved in the use of the Service. By accessing the Service, you agree and understand that you have no right of withdrawal, other than to terminate. If you wish to terminate the agreement constituted by the Terms of Use, you must immediately stop using the Commu Service and delete the application and user account downloaded to use the Service.

Applications that enable you to use the Commu Service, such as mobile and tablet applications, made available to you through the Apple App Store, Google Play or other service provider, are subject to the terms and conditions of that service provider in addition to these Terms of Use.

### **Registration**

* You understand that you, and only you, are fully responsible for your account, the content on it and the activity that occurs through it. 
* You understand that you are responsible for keeping your account secure. You are responsible for ensuring that your password is strong enough, that other people do not have access to your device or email, etc.
    * If harmful or damaging activities are carried out through your account, we may hold you liable for them.
* You understand that you may have only one user account.

Registering on the Commu Service under a false name or with an email that is not your personal email is prohibited. 

### **Interaction with other users**

You are responsible for your interactions with other Users, whether online or face-to-face. You agree to take reasonable precautions in all interactions with other Users.

You agree to comply with the [Community Guidelines](https://commuapp.fi/en/community-guidelines) in force at any given time and the rules for dealing with users set out therein.

You acknowledge that Commu does not verify the actual identity of Users or the content that Users add to the Commu and that Commu has no obligation or ability to guarantee that another User is what he or she says he or she is. Commu shall not be liable for any damage caused by third parties, such as other Users, posting content to the Commu or using such content. You understand that the information about Users provided by Commu is for your decision-making purposes only and is not a promise or guarantee of anything.

You agree to indemnify Commu against any liability or damage arising from the User’s (including your) conduct while using the Commu Service. The previously mentioned freedom of responsibilities includes any type of direct, indirect, special and/or incidental and other similar damages, including economic loss, property damage, physical injury, emotional distress and/or other damages that may result from communications, dealings, contracts or other conduct with other Users or other persons you encounter while using the Commu Service.

Please note that you may still have the right to request evidence from Commu in such a situation. For more information, see the section on _Responsibilities, Rights and Obligations._

### **User responsibility for personal data**

You agree that the information you provide about yourself is up-to-date, truthful and does not contain offensive or illegal material. Illegal material includes, but is not limited to, material protected by copyright.

### **Making notices in the Commu**

By creating a notice, you agree that the information you provide is accurate and truthful, in the right category, of the right type and not misleading. You agree that your notices are current, that you are willing to receive communications from users in relation to your notice and that you are willing to provide or receive the service specified in the notice. When you create a notice, you must be aware of the [Community Guidelines](https://commuapp.fi/en/community-guidelines) in force at the time and you undertake that you will not breach these rules and that your notice will not contain any of the prohibited topics mentioned in the Community guidelines. The content must not contain copyrighted material that you are not authorized to distribute in a forward facing manner.

Commu users are responsible for all posts that he / she makes. Commu does not take responsibility for the content of the posts or messages.

Violation of these terms may result in the deletion of your notice and/or the closure of your account. 

### **Operating under the organisation’s account**

Commu allows users to belong to one or more organisations. Among other things, this allows users to give themselves a different nickname and image when working under an organisation. The notices created in this way will also be displayed differently.

Membership of an organisation is voluntary for the user and by joining and operating under an organisation, the user accepts that the administrators of the organisation can see their information in their Commu profile, their usage history under the name of the organisation account and the notices they create under the organisation. The user accepts that the intellectual property rights to the content created by him/her under his/her organisation account are owned by the organisation, not by the user himself/herself. The exception to this is conversations that the user has in the application, to which the organisation does not have rights. However, the user can transfer the ownership of his/her notice to another user within the same organisation. In this case, the conversations previously held will also be transferred to the new owner. However, the user is not relieved of his/her obligations and responsibilities, even if he/she is operating under an organisation and the content created is owned by the organisation.

### **Responsibilities, rights and obligations**

You understand and accept the following:

* Finland has freedom of contract. This means that what another user agrees with you can be interpreted under Finnish law as a contract between you and the other user or users. The matter agreed upon may give rise to a legal action under Finnish law relating to the contract
* Commu is not responsible in any way for contracts between users and is not a party to any contract. Commu shall have no liability for compensation, indemnification or contribution in the event of any dispute.
* You have the right to request evidence from Commu, if necessary, to resolve your dispute. The right of access applies only to information to which the user is a party. Commu reserves the right to determine what information is disclosed to users. Commu is obliged to process a request for information within 30 days of receipt of the request. 
* Commu is not responsible for the quality of the work and is not liable for any damages.
* The notice creator is responsible for
    * The legality of the notice
    * That the notice does not violate the terms of use

We are constantly developing Commu to better meet the needs of our users, and changes can also affect the Terms of Use.

### **Consequences of violation of the terms of use**

### **Disputes between users**

Users are encouraged to resolve disputes between themselves, preferably through mutual negotiation. Users are aware that the resolution of disputes between users is entirely the responsibility of the users. Commu is not a party to any dispute between users. However, Commu may, if necessary, contribute to the resolution of a dispute by providing information about the content of the notice or discussions in order to help resolve the dispute. You understand, however, that Commu is not responsible for resolving disputes or facilitating resolution.

Commu shall not be liable as a third party for any costs, such as legal fees and other legal costs, incurred in the event of a dispute between users.

### **Feedback**

Feedback is important to us so that we can make Commu even better. We welcome suggestions, comments and praise.

### **Duration and termination**

These Terms of Use are valid from 01.02.2024. 

These Terms of Use are in effect between Commu and the User for as long as the User uses the Commu Service. The User may stop using the Commu Service at any time. If you wish, you may close your Commu account at any time by sending us a message to [company@commuapp.fi](mailto:company@commuapp.fi). Termination of the Terms of Use does not relieve you of your obligation to perform the agreed services, as the related agreement is between you and the other user.

Nor does termination of the contract invalidate any terms which by their nature are intended to remain in force after the expiry or termination of the contract. Such terms which shall remain in force notwithstanding termination include, but are not limited to, the sections of the Terms of Use describing liability, indemnity, types of damage, data protection, dispute resolution, protection of property rights.

Commu may at any time and for any reason discontinue providing the Commu Service, permanently or temporarily. In the event of suspension or termination of the provision of the Service, the User shall no longer have the right to use the Service.

### **Intellectual property rights**

Commu will have full access to all material that you, as a user, upload to the application. As a user, you must accept the possibility that your public data may also be re-used. Public data refers here to data that can be accessed by other users in the application without your active participation. 

Commu will not use your information or material for resale purposes. As a user, you also retain the intellectual property rights in the materials.

If you wish to use the Commu logo or other similar brand or image-related material, you must first contact us and request permission to use it. However, you may share screenshots from the app without permission.

You may not use any data mining, robotic, scraping or similar data gathering or extraction methods to obtain Service Content. No part of the Commu Service may be copied, reproduced, modified, republished, reproduced, distributed, reposted, uploaded, posted, reposted or resold in any form or by any means, in whole or in part, except as expressly permitted in the Terms of Use. The Service may be used only by means expressly permitted by the Terms of Use.

### **Data protection**

Commu acts as a data controller within the meaning of the Personal Data Act. To the extent required to use the Service, Commu may collect and process the User’s personal data.

Commu processes users’ personal data in accordance with the Privacy Policy, data protection legislation and the terms of the Privacy Policy. The **Commu** Privacy Statement and Privacy Policy are available at [**https://commuapp.fi/en/privacy-policy/.**](https://commuapp.fi/en/privacy-policy) By using the Service, you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.  

### **Applicable law and disputes with Commu**

These Terms of Use are governed by Finnish law, excluding its conflict of law provisions. These Terms of Use have been drafted in accordance with Finnish law.

Commu will always seek to resolve any dispute regarding the Terms of Use or the Service through negotiation. In the event that a negotiated resolution of the subject matter of the dispute cannot be reached, any dispute between Users and Commu arising out of these Terms of Use shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Arbitration Committee of the Central Chamber of Commerce, composed of one arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Helsinki and the language of the arbitration shall be Finnish. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, each party shall bear its own costs, regardless of which party is deemed to be the prevailing party in the arbitration.

### **Other conditions**

This agreement was originally drafted in Finnish. If any translated version of this Agreement conflicts with the Finnish version, the Finnish version shall prevail.

These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Commu, superseding any prior discussions and correspondence between the parties regarding the Services. 

If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be modified to conform to applicable law so as to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the other parts will remain in full force and effect. 

Commu’s failure to exercise any right under these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of that right or any other right.

When interpreting the Terms of Use, the content of the Terms of Use takes precedence over the title of the Terms of Use. The Contra proferentem rule for the interpretation of a contract shall not be applied to the detriment of the author of the terms of use. The user is obliged to carefully study the contents of the Terms of Use before accepting them. The Terms of Use have been drafted for the benefit of the Commu and the User, since the Terms of Use establish and specify the rights and obligations of the parties.

You agree to comply with all local, regional and national laws, ordinances, rules and regulations when using the Commu Service.
