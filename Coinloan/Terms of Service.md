    7. The nature of Cryptoassets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack, including rollback attacks or Blockchain reorganizations.

Although CoinLoan takes precautionary measures to protect against cyber threats, some circumstances may lead to losses or damages.
    8. In light of these risks mentioned herein, which are only some of the risks involved in using the Services and holding or trading in Cryptoassets and do not constitute an exhaustive list of such risks, You should carefully consider whether holding or investing through Cryptoassets in general and/or using the Platform suits You in light of Your financial condition and awareness of the risks.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ELSEWHERE IN THESE TERMS, THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, COINLOAN, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE.

    2.
