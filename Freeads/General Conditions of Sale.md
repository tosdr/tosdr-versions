Posting an advert on Freeads is usually free (excluding certain categories), however we charge a fee for account and advert upgrades as well as standard adverts in the massage category. By clicking “post ad” you are agreeing to our privacy policy, terms & conditions and posting rules for acceptable content. Sometimes we alter the charge for certain categories, whether for a promotion or a permanent fee change, you will be able to see these fees clearly displayed when posting an advert (at the bottom of the screen).

By placing an advert with Freeads, you are agreeing that your advert may be rejected if we believe it breaches any of our terms of use or posting rules. If this is the case, you may be entitled to a refund of the fee paid, although we would reserve the right not to issue a refund for fees paid to Freeads in any of the following cases:

• If you breach, in our opinion, Freeads terms of use, including and without limitation to our posting rules;

• If your advert was live on the site for any length of time before rejection and benefited from exposure to our members;

• If your advert was placed in the massage category;

• If you have removed your own advert;

• If you have posted a duplicate advert as defined in our rules regarding duplicate adverts;

• If we believe you have posted an advert in a significantly wrong category for the purpose of misdirecting Freeads;

• Please note, this list is not exhaustive and the support team will look at individual refunds on a case by case basis if the above do not apply.

  

VIP Upgrades:

  

VIP Upgrades are a non refundable purchase. The upgrade process provides immediate access to the advertisers telephone number (where provided), instant messaging and Priority alerts.  If you experience any problems in upgrading or using the VIP service, please contact our support team for assistance.
