DATA TRANSFER TO THIRD PARTIES  
  

Data is only passed on to third parties within the framework of legal requirements. We only pass on user data to third parties if this is necessary, for example, for contractual purposes or on the basis of legitimate interests in the economic and effective operation of our business.

  

If we use subcontractors to provide our services, we take appropriate legal precautions as well as corresponding technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of personal data in accordance with the relevant legal regulations. We would like to point out that due to the use of Google Analytics, a data transfer takes place when using our online offer.

  

DATA TRANSFER TO A THIRD COUNTRY OR AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION  
  

Third countries are countries in which the GDPR is not directly applicable law. This basically includes all countries outside the UK, the EU, or the European Economic Area.

  

Whenever a data transfer to a third country or an international organisation takes place. We apply and ensure that appropriate/adequate safeguards are in place and that enforceable rights and effective remedies are available to you.

  

For a copy of the appropriate safeguards, please see the links below:

  

STORAGE PERIOD OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA  
  

We adhere to the principles of data economy and data avoidance. This means that we only store the data you make available to us for as long as is necessary to fulfil the aforementioned purposes or as stipulated by the various storage periods provided for by law. If the respective purpose ceases to apply or after expiry of the corresponding periods, your data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions. We have created an internal concept to ensure this procedure.

  

LOG FILES  
  

In principle, it is possible to use the Freeads website without providing personal data. When a page of our website is accessed and each time a file is retrieved, access data about this process is stored in a log file. The corresponding log file contains: Your IP address, the page from which the file was requested, the name of the file, the date and time of the request, the amount of data transferred, the access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.), a description of the type of operating system and web browser used. The stored data does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your identity and is evaluated exclusively for statistical purposes.

  

The collection and processing of this data is carried out in order to enable the use of the website at all, on the basis of our legitimate interest, whereby our legitimate interest is the provision of our website. Incidentally, we store this aforementioned data, including the IP addresses, only in anonymised form and use it only in this anonymised form to analyse the use of the offer and the further development and optimisation of our website in your interest. Our legitimate interest is the ongoing improvement of our online offer in order to provide you with the greatest possible user comfort.

  

COOKIES  
  

During the use of our website, so-called "cookies", small text files, are stored on your computer. Such cookies register information about your computer's navigation on our website (pages selected, day, time and duration of use, etc.). A cookie is downloaded via a browser the first time you visit a website. The next time you visit this website with the same device, the browser checks whether a corresponding cookie is present (i.e., contains the website name). It sends the data stored in the cookie back to the website. Some cookies are important for the website's functionality and are automatically activated by us when a user visits. Our website also uses cookies to make it easier to use and to provide you with content tailored to your information needs.

The legal basis for this is the fulfilment of our services and implementation of contractual measures and our legitimate interests. We also use software to maintain customer data on the basis of our legitimate interests (efficient and fast processing of user requests).

We would like to point out that e-mails can be read or changed unauthorised and unnoticed during transmission. Furthermore, we would like to point out that we use software to filter unwanted e-mails (spam filter). The spam filter can reject e-mails if they have been falsely identified as spam by certain characteristics.

Personal data will continue to be collected and processed if you provide it to us for the performance of a contract or when opening an account. Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. Deletion of your account is possible at any time and can be done by sending a message to us. We store and use the data provided by you for the purpose of processing the contract. After complete processing of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be blocked with regard to tax and commercial law retention periods and deleted after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented to a further use of your data or a legally permitted further use of data has been reserved on our part.

CONVENIENCE LOG IN AND SIGN UP  
  

Third-party Connect features such as [Facebook Connect](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) are offered as an option to register with Freeads. When registering via connect functions of third-party providers, the user agrees to the respective terms and conditions of these third-party providers and also consents to certain data from the respective profiles of the user being transferred to Freeads.

  

PROFILE  
  

As a registered user, you have the opportunity to create a user profile with just a few clicks and details. If you make use of the option, the relevant profile data you provide will be transferred to your profile. Of course, you can change the information at any time via the settings in your profile. When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, property information, photos and images etc. Content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account. Insofar as legal retention periods are to be observed, storage also takes place beyond the time of deletion of a user account.

  

NEWSLETTER AND NOTIFICATION DISPATCH  
  

If you have registered for the newsletter or send messages to users or place and respond to ads we send notifications, we will process your personal data for the purpose of sending the newsletter or notification. The processing is carried out voluntarily on the basis of your consent. You can revoke this consent at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the end of the newsletter and notification. Of course, you can also contact us by any other means (e.g., by post) and revoke your consent. Processing will continue until you withdraw your consent. The lawfulness of the processing carried out until the withdrawal of consent is not affected by this. After revocation of consent, the personal data will be kept for another 6 months for the purpose of legal defence. The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest.

  

COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES  
  

We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g., customers and interested parties in the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as related measures and in the context of communication with contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g., to answer enquiries.

  

We process this data to fulfil our contractual obligations, to secure our rights and for the purposes of the administrative tasks associated with this information as well as for business organisation. We only disclose the data of the contractual partners to third parties within the scope of the applicable law to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or for the fulfilment of legal obligations or with the consent of the contractual partners (e.g., to participating telecommunications, transport, and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisers, payment service providers or tax authorities).

  

Unless otherwise specified the purposes of processing are Contractual performance and service, contact requests and communication, office and organisational procedures, administration, and response to requests, visit action evaluation, interest-based and behavioural marketing. And, the Legal bases are Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries, Legal obligation, and our Legitimate interests.

  

ADMINISTRATION, FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING, OFFICE ORGANISATION, CONTACT MANAGEMENT  
  

We process data in the context of administrative tasks as well as organisation of our operations, financial accounting and compliance with legal obligations, such as archiving. In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organisation, archiving of data, i.e., tasks that serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the data mentioned in these processing activities.

  

In this context, we disclose or transfer data to consultants, such as legal advisors or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.

  

Furthermore, based on our business interests, we store information on suppliers and other business partners, e.g., for the purpose of contacting them at a later date. This data, most of which is company-related, is generally stored permanently.

  

DATA TRANSFER TO PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS  
  

In order to fulfil the contract, we pass on your data to the company commissioned with the payment ([](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1643710223029544%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw31D1EGVtRSv2xEY7NskVCs&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1643710223087988&usg=AOvVaw3VBxaK3kGFWtIMpySrqjdR)[Stripe](https://stripe.com/)), insofar as this is necessary for the payment of our services. Depending on which payment method you select, we pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service provider. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves. In this case, the privacy policy of the respective payment service provider applies. The legal basis for the data processing is contract.

  

PAYMENT SERVICES  
  

We integrate payment services from third-party companies on our services ([Stripe](https://stripe.com/QwHL4MujaQBI2A)). When you make a purchase from us, your payment data (e.g., name, payment amount, account details, credit card number) is processed by the payment service provider for the purpose of payment processing. For these transactions, the respective contract and data protection provisions of the respective providers apply. The payment service providers are used on the basis of contract processing and in the interest of a smooth, convenient and secure payment process. Insofar as your consent is requested for certain actions, is the legal basis for data processing; consents can be revoked at any time for the future.

  

The data processed by the payment services include the payment data mentioned above. The information is necessary to carry out the transactions. However, the customer data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that data of the payment service provider is transmitted to credit agencies. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective payment service providers.

  

ENCRYPTED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS  
  

If there is an obligation to transmit your payment data to us (e.g., account number in the case of direct debit authorisation) after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.

  

Payment transactions via the common means of payment are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

  

With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

  

DATA PROCESSING FOR THE PURPOSE OF FRAUD PREVENTION AND OPTIMISATION OF OUR PAYMENT PROCESSES  
  

Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.

  

LEGAL DEFENCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF OUR RIGHTS  
  

The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest. The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is the defence against unjustified claims and the legal enforcement and assertion of claims and rights.

  

Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. The processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement is mandatory for legal defence and enforcement of our rights. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.

  

DIRECT MARKETING IN THE CONTEXT OF A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP  
  

We use the data you provide to fulfil and process our contract and to respond to your enquiries or on the basis of your consent. Insofar as you have also given us separate consent to process your data for consulting and advertising purposes, we are entitled to contact you for these purposes via the communication channels you have consented to.

  

WHEN YOU SEND A DATA SUBJECT ACCESS REQUEST  
  

The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of handling your data subject access request is our legal obligation and the legal basis for the subsequent documentation of the data subject access request is both our legitimate interest and our legal obligation.

  

The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of processing data when you send a data subject access request is to respond to your request. The subsequent documentation of the data subject access request serves to fulfil the legally required accountability.

  

Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the processing of a data subject access request, this is three years after the end of the respective process.

  

You have the possibility at any time to object to the processing of your personal data in the context of the processing of a data subject access request for the future. In this case, however, we will not be able to further process your request. The documentation of the legally compliant processing of the respective data subject access request is mandatory. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.

  

PROVISION OF OUR STATUTORY AND BUSINESS SERVICES  
  

We process the data of our members, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards members, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.

  

The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).

  

We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes. This is determined according to the respective tasks and contractual relationships. In the case of business processing, we retain the data for as long as it may be relevant for the processing of the business as well as with regard to any warranty or liability obligations. The necessity of retaining the data is reviewed every three years; otherwise, the statutory retention obligations apply.

  

ICON LINKS TO SOCIAL NETWORKS  
  

We use small icons that refer to our website on third-party platforms (e.g., [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/en/privacy), [Pinterest](https://policy.pinterest.com/en-gb/privacy-policy)). These are hyperlinks in each case, so no data is transferred from you automatically, but only when you click on the icons and a new tab opens in your browser with the third-party website. When you visit one of our pages equipped with a Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest plugin, a connection to the Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter server is established. This tells the Facebook, Pinterest or Twitter server which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest account, you enable Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest to assign your surfing behaviour directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest account. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest are used in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers.

  

SOCIAL MEDIA  
  

The data you enter on our social media pages, such as comments, videos, pictures, likes, public messages, etc. are published by the social media platform and are not used or processed by us for any other purpose at any time. We only reserve the right to delete content if this should be necessary. Where applicable, we share your content on our site if this is a function of the social media platform and communicate with you via the social media platform. The legal basis is our legitimate interest. The data processing is carried out in the interest of our public relations and communication.

  

If you wish to object to certain data processing over which we have an influence, please contact us. We will then examine your objection. If you send us a request on the social media platform, we may also refer you to other secure communication channels that guarantee confidentiality, depending on the response required. You always have the option of sending us confidential inquiries to our address stated in the imprint.

  

As already stated, where the social media platform provider gives us the opportunity, we take care to design our social media pages to be as data protection compliant as possible. With regard to statistics that the provider of the social media platform makes available to us, we can only influence these to a limited extent and cannot switch them off. However, we make sure that no additional optional statistics are made available to us.

  

DATA PROCESSING BY THE OPERATOR OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM  
  

The operator of the social media platform uses web tracking methods. The web tracking can also take place regardless of whether you are logged in or registered with the social media platform. As already explained, we can unfortunately hardly influence the web tracking methods of the social media platform. We cannot, for example, switch this off.

  

Please be aware: It cannot be ruled out that the provider of the social media platform uses your profile and behavioural data, for example to evaluate your habits, personal relationships, preferences, etc. We have no influence on this. In this respect, we have no influence on the processing of your data by the provider of the social media platform.

You have the right to revoke the use of your data for internal purposes at any time with effect for the future. To do so, it is sufficient to send a corresponding e-mail to datenschutz@markt.de. However, such a revocation does not affect the lawfulness of the processing operations carried out by us up to that point. This does not affect data processing with regard to all other legal bases, such as the initiation of a contract (see above).

  

PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA  
  

We take contractual, organisational and technical security measures in accordance with the state of the art to ensure that the provisions of the data protection laws are complied with and to protect the data we process against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or against access by unauthorised persons.

  

The security measures include in particular the encrypted transmission of data between your browser and our server. For this purpose, a 256-bit SSL (AES 256) encryption technology is used. This includes your IP address.

  

In doing so, your personal data is protected within the scope of the following points (excerpt):

  

a) Maintaining the confidentiality of your personal data.

In order to maintain the confidentiality of your personal data stored with us, we have taken various measures to control access, entry and access control.

  

b) Maintaining the integrity of your personal data

In order to maintain the integrity of your personal data stored with us, we have taken various measures to control disclosure and input.

  

c) Maintaining the availability of your personal data

In order to maintain the availability of your personal data stored with us, we have taken various measures to control orders and availability.

  

The security measures in place are continuously improved in line with technological developments. Despite these precautions, due to the insecure nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmission to our online service. Therefore, any data transmission from you to our website is at your own risk.

  

PROTECTION OF MINORS  
  

Personal information may only be provided to us by persons under the age of 18 with the express consent of their legal guardians. This data will be processed in accordance with this privacy policy.

  

THIRD PARTY SERVICES

  

a) Google Analytics

  

If you have given your consent, this website uses [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy) Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. The responsible service provider in the EU is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google").

  

Google Analytics uses cookies that enable an analysis of your use of our web sites. The information collected by means of the cookies about your use of this website is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

  

We use the function 'anonymizeIP' (so-called IP masking): Due to the activation of IP anonymisation on this web site, your IP address will be shortened by Google. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.

  

On our behalf, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your (pseudonymous) use of the website and compiling reports on website activity. The reports provided by Google Analytics are used to analyse the performance of our website and the success of our marketing campaigns.

  

The recipient of the data is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland as a processor. We have concluded an order processing agreement with Google for this purpose. A transfer of data to the USA cannot be ruled out. Google LLC, based in California, USA, and possibly US authorities can access the data stored by Google. The data sent by us and linked to cookies are automatically deleted after 14 months. Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.

  

The legal basis for this data processing is your consent, Art.6 Abs.1 S.1 lit.a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future by calling up the cookie settings and changing your selection there.

  

b) Google Tag Manager

  

We use Google Tag Manager, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). This service allows website tags to be managed via an interface. The Google Tag Manager only implements tags. No cookies are set and no personal data is collected. The Google Tag Manager triggers other tags that may collect data. The Google Tag Manager does not access this data.

  

If a deactivation has been made at domain or cookie level, it remains in place for all tracking tags, insofar as these are implemented with the Google Tag Manager. More information on the Google Tag Manager can be found at the following link: [http://www.google.de/tagmanager/use-policy.html](http://www.google.de/tagmanager/use-policy.html).

  

This service transmits data to the USA. The transmission takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You give your consent by selecting the appropriate option in the consent management tool, which is displayed when you access our site. You can view and adjust your data protection settings here at any time.

  

c) Google Ad Manager

  

We use the online marketing tool Google Ad Manager from the operator Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

  

Google Ad Manager uses cookies to serve ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads more than once. Google uses a cookie ID to record which ads are shown in which browser and can thus prevent them from being shown more than once.

  

In addition, Google Ad Manager can use cookie IDs to record so-called conversions that are related to ad requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a Google Ad Manager ad and later calls up the advertiser's website with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, Google Ad Manager cookies do not contain any personal information. Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with Google's server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of Google Ad Manager, Google receives the information that you have called up the corresponding part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, it is possible that the provider may obtain and store your IP address.

  

You can object to participation in this tracking procedure by deactivating cookies for conversion tracking. To do this, set your browser to block cookies from the domain [www.googleadservices.com](http://www.googleadservices.com/), [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads), whereby this setting will be deleted when you delete your cookies.

  

Alternatively, you can obtain information about the setting of cookies from the Digital Advertising Alliance at the internet address [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) and make settings for this. Finally, you can set your browser in such a way that you are informed about the setting of cookies and decide individually about their acceptance or exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general. If you do not accept cookies, the functionality of our online offer may be limited.

  

This service transmits data to the USA. The transmission takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You give your consent by making the appropriate selection in the consent management tool, which is displayed when you call up our site. You can view and adjust your data protection settings here at any time.

  

d) Google AdSense

  

We use Google AdSense, a web advertising service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google"). Google AdSense uses so-called "DoubleClick DART Cookies" ("Cookies"). In addition, Google AdSense also uses so-called "web beacons" (small invisible graphics) to collect information, through the use of which simple actions such as user traffic on our online offer can be recorded, collected and evaluated. The information generated by the cookie and/or web beacon (including your IP address) about your visit to this website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

  

Google uses the information thus obtained to carry out an evaluation of user behaviour with regard to the AdSense ads. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google AdSense will not be merged with other Google data. The information collected by Google may be transferred to third parties where required to do so by law, and/or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

  

This service transmits data to the USA. The transmission takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You give your consent by making the appropriate selection in the consent management tool, which is displayed when you call up our site. You can view and adjust your data protection settings here at any time.

  

e) Google Ads - conversion tracking

  

We use the online advertising programme "Google Ads" of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland and conversion tracking within the framework of Google Ads. The conversion tracking cookie is set when you click on an ad placed by Google. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit pages of this online offer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognise that you have clicked on the ad and have been redirected to this page. Each Google Ads user receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be tracked across Ads users' websites.

The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Ads users who have opted in to conversion tracking. We learn the total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information that identifies you personally. If you do not wish to participate in the tracking, you can object to this use by deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie via the internet browser under user settings. You will subsequently not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.

This service transmits data to the USA. The transmission takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You give your consent by making the appropriate selection in the consent management tool, which is displayed when you call up our site. You can view and adjust your data protection settings here at any time.

  

f) Google Ads - Remarketing

  

We use the online advertising programme "Google Ads" of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland and the remarketing service within the framework of Google Ads. This enables us to target you with personalised, interest-related advertising if you have already shown an interest in our offers. The advertising material is displayed on the basis of a cookie-based analysis of previous usage behaviour, but no personal data is stored.

  

In the cases of retargeting technology, a cookie is stored on your computer or mobile device in order to collect anonymised data about interests and thus to adapt the advertising individually to the stored information. As a result, you will be shown advertising that is most likely to match your product and information interests.

  

This service transmits data to the USA. The transmission takes place exclusively on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You give your consent by making the appropriate selection in the consent management tool, which is displayed when you call up our site. You can view and adjust your data protection settings here at any time.

  

g) Google reCAPTCHA

  

We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our websites. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data input on our websites (e.g. in a contact form) is made by a human being or by an automated programme, and reCAPTCHA also protects our users from SPAM when using the message function. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, time spent by the website visitor on the website or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.

  

The reCAPTCHA analyses run entirely in the background. Website visitors are not informed that an analysis is taking place.

  

The data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our offers from abusive automated spying and our users from SPAM. The data transfer to the USA is based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, it is necessary to fulfil our contract with the user.
