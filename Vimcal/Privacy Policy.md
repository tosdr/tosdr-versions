Privacy Policy
==============

Updated November 18, 2022

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, install, register with, access, or use Vimcal; by doing so, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of or access to Vimcal after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates, available at the following link: www.vimcal.com/privacy.

‍

#### 1\. Contact Us

If you have questions about data protection, or if you have any requests for resolving issues with your personal data, we encourage you to primarily contact us through our website so we can reply to you more quickly.

_Name of the controller_: Michael Zhao, COO  
_Address_: 6798 Lopez Canyon Way, San Diego, CA 92126

_Email_: [\[email protected\]](https://www.vimcal.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

‍

#### 2\. Data We Collect About You

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which

that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed(anonymous data). We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:

▪  **Identity Data** includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, title, date of birth and gender.

▪  **Contact Data** includes billing address, delivery address, email address, and telephone numbers.

▪  **Transaction Data** includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.

▪  **Technical Data** includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.

▪  **Profile Data** includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses.

▪  **Usage Data** includes information about how you use Vimcal, its products, and the Services.

▪  **Marketing and Communications Data** includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.

We collect, use, and share **Aggregated Data** such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will **not** directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature of Vimcal. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

Specifically, **we do not collect or capture sensitive data such as credit or debit card numbers, personal financial account information, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, driver’s license numbers or similar identifiers, or employment, financial or health information**. We hereby disclaims any liability for any such sensitive information that is input into Vimcal by the user.

We also do not collect any **Special Categories of Personal Data** about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offenses.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any information that is collected by Vimcal is almost entirely stored locally with you and in small part on Company services, primarily because we use Google’s and Microsoft's API as the source of truth. For example, your company information or personal contacts are not stored in our services, but only with you. When you log out from your Device, most of your data is erased.

‍

#### 3\. Information We Collect and How We Collect It

We collect information from and about users of Vimcal:

▪  Directly from you when you provide it to us;

▪  Automatically when you use Vimcal; and

▪  Data we collect from our partners.

‍

#### 4\. Information You Provide to Us

When you download, install, register with, access, or use Vimcal, we may ask you to provide information (a) by which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, email address, or any other personal or personally identifiable information under applicable law, and/or(b) that is about you but individually does not identify you.

This information includes, without limitation:

‍

‍

#### 5\. Automatic Information Collection and Tracking

When you download, install, register with, access, and use Vimcal, it may use technology to automatically collect:

We only cache a small percent of calendar invites for performance gains, with past events being routinely deleted on a daily basis.

You acknowledge and accept that Vimcal has certain content, features, functionality and/or services that are based on geolocation, location tracking, and geofencing which may also be collecting information on your use and access of Vimcal, including information on your surroundings and background.  You can disable this function in the settings of your Device, but some parts of Vimcal may then not function properly.

If you do not want us to collect this information, do not download, install, register with, use or access Vimcal, or delete it from your Device.

#### _Information Collection and Tracking Technologies_

The technologies we use for automatic information collection may include:

▪  Cookies (or mobile cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on your Device.  Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize Vimcal, analyze use, and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your settings, but some parts of Vimcal may then not function properly; and

▪  Web Beacons. Parts of Vimcal and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related Vimcal statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain Vimcal content, features, functionality, and services, and verifying system and server integrity).

‍

‍

#### 6. Data We Collect From Our Partners

We also collect the following data from our partners:

We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.

#### 10\. Data Security

To enhance the security of Vimcal, we encrypt user tokens, API keys, and authentication cookies, both at rest and in transit. Additionally, authorization cookies are HTTP-only, and requests between User and server are scoped to each individual user, so that User data is siloed.

#### 12\. Your Rights And Options

You have the right to:

▪  **Opt-out** of marketing emails and other direct marketing.

▪  **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

▪  **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you.This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

▪  **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

▪  **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

▪  **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

o  If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.

o  Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.

o  Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

o  You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

▪  **Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

▪  **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  You can withdraw your consent, for example ,by turning off GPS location sharing in your Device settings.
