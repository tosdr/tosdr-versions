You and other users of the Site may have the ability to post, upload, input, submit or otherwise make available (“Posting”) certain information, content, or materials, including testimonials, reviews, posts, comments and other user-generated content, pictures and documents through the Site (each a “Submission(s)”). A Submission reflects only the opinions or reviews of the user who made the Submission available and does not reflect the opinions of Okta, regardless of whether or not the user is affiliated with Okta. Submissions are made available for your general knowledge only and should never be relied upon. By Posting your Submission(s), you grant to Okta, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, an irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, nonexclusive, and royalty-free, and worldwide license, without additional consideration to you or any third party, to copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), create derivative works of, adapt, modify, edit, translate, reformat, and otherwise use, analyze and exploit such Submission, in any medium or form now existing or later developed, and for any purpose; to publish (or not publish) your name in connection with your Submission(s); and the right to sublicense such rights to others, including Okta’s affiliates and any suppliers of the Site and/or our services.

By Posting a Submission, you represent and warrant: that you own, control, or have otherwise secured, all of the rights to your Submission, including the content therein, and the Posting thereof; that the content is complete and accurate and is not fraudulent, tortious or otherwise in violation of any applicable law or any right of any third party; to the extent that the content contains any intellectual property, including, without limitation, trademarks, patents, rights of publicity, copyrights to any creative works, including, without limitation, text, audio, video, software code, artwork, images, photographs, pictures or any other content in whole or in part that is protected by any intellectual property laws (collectively, “Submitted IP”), that you are the copyright owner of such Submitted IP, or that the copyright owner of such Submitted IP has granted you permission to use such Image or any content and/or images contained in such Submitted IP consistent with the manner and purpose of your use and as otherwise permitted by these Terms; that you have the rights necessary to grant the licenses and sublicenses described in these Terms; that use of the Submission(s) you supply does not violate this policy, does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any person or entity, and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify Okta for all claims resulting from your Submission(s).
