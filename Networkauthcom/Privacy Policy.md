Product End-of-Life (EOL) Policy
--------------------------------

* * *

Cisco Meraki may find it necessary to discontinue products for a number of reasons, including product line enhancements, market demands, technology innovation, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer products. We have set our end-of-life (EOL) policy to help customers better manage their product end-of-life transition.

When a product reaches EOL, Meraki is committed to communicating important milestones throughout the EOL period.  These notifications will include the initial EOL notification, the End of Sale (EOS) announcement, and the End of Support (EOST) dates, as well as other key information pertaining to Cisco Meraki products.

Any products being discontinued will be announced as End of Sale and identified on the Cisco Meraki website up to six months prior to the discontinuation and EOS date (also known as the last order date). On the EOS Date, discontinued hardware products are removed from the price list and are no longer available for purchase. The device-specific licenses corresponding to discontinued hardware products will be available for purchase after the EOS Date, unless the license(s) is/are listed in the “End-of-Life Products” list provided below. Cisco Meraki typically provides support for a given product for a period of five (5) years after the EOS date. If the discontinued product is not available for replacement or repair of an in-warranty return, Cisco Meraki may replace the discontinued product with functionally equivalent hardware and transfer the remaining license term from the replaced product to the replacement hardware.

Although legacy Cisco Meraki products typically can connect to our cloud-based management software for the entire useful life of the product, following the EOST Date, some things may change, including the following:

* Cisco Meraki cannot guarantee that legacy hardware products will be able to connect to the management software indefinitely following the EOST Date;
* Cisco Meraki Technical Support may no longer troubleshoot the legacy hardware products;
* Cisco Meraki may no longer issue firmware updates or patches for the legacy products; and
* New software features available for the management software may not be compatible with the legacy hardware functionality or with the firmware running on the legacy hardware.

If either of the first two situations above occurs, then we will use our best efforts to provide the customer with a workable solution for upgrading from the legacy hardware and, failing that, will credit the value of any remaining license time attributable to the legacy hardware to the customer’s Dashboard organization on a prorated basis.

##### Summary

* End-of-Sale Announcement: Date of official end-of-sales notice, typically six months prior to the last order date.
* End-of-Sale (EOS) Date: The last date to order the product through Cisco Meraki point-of-sale outlets. After this date, the product is no longer for sale via any channel.
* End-of-Support (EOST) Date: The last date a product will be affirmatively supported by Cisco Meraki, typically five years following the EOS Date.

_\*Please note that announcements will be updated periodically to amend the functionally equivalent products._

For a full list of product, announcements and dates, please refer to our [Product End-of-Life (EOL) Policies documentations article](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Product_End-of-Life_(EOL)_Policies).

In some limited cases, Cisco Meraki may also find it necessary to discontinue certain features. For more information, see the [WAN Optimization feature retirement notice](https://meraki.cisco.com/lib/pdf/eol/meraki_eol_wan_opt.pdf).

We will ship replacement units within five business days of receiving your defective units. If no trouble is found, we will contact you before taking further action.

If you require advance replacement, please call Cisco Meraki technical support. Unless you have purchased Meraki Now, advance replacement orders will ship within 1 business day on a best case effort basis.

Additional information about Cisco Meraki’s hardware warranty can be found in [Cisco Meraki’s End Customer Agreement](https://meraki.cisco.com/meraki-support/policies/#end-customer-agreement).

##### Meraki Now

If you require replacement of Meraki products covered by [Meraki Now](https://meraki.cisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/meraki_now_solution_guide.pdf) services, please [call Meraki technical support](https://meraki.cisco.com/support/overview) and request Meraki Now advance replacement.

##### Product Trial Returns

If you would like to return units from a product trial, please go to your product trial webpage (using the link your rep provided you with) and go to the returns tab to fill out the RMA request form.

##### Refund Requests

Effective January 30, 2022, all new Cisco and Meraki orders submitted for hardware, and any attached software, will be non-cancellable and cannot be modified starting 45 days prior to the current estimated ship date. Meraki license-only orders are not impacted by this policy. Non-cancellable orders are not eligible for RMA credit and are not eligible for an RMA exception. For additional information, please contact your Meraki representative.

To request a refund for your license-only order, please complete our RMA request form. All returns must meet the following criteria:

1. You purchased the product through an authorized Cisco Meraki reseller or directly from Cisco Meraki
2. You are the original purchaser of the product
3. You submit your refund request within 30 days of purchase
4. Your license is not a Meraki Subscription License\*

If your refund request is approved, Cisco Meraki will email you an RMA number and we will process your return. If you purchased through a Cisco Meraki reseller, your refund will be issued by that reseller. If you purchased directly from Cisco Meraki, we will issue a refund, typically within 15 days of processing the return. (If you paid by credit card we will credit the original credit card. If you paid by any other method, we will send you a check.)

Meraki Subscription Licensing refund criteria will remain the same as “license-only orders”; however, your refund will be prorated based on your Subscription Activation date. Please review cancellation policies and procedures in the Meraki Subscription [CCW Ordering Guide](https://salesconnect.cisco.com/Meraki/apex/scormanywhere__SCORM_Player?courseId=a1m8c00000qmvUFAAY)

##### Shipment Preparation

* Please return units in their entirety. That is, include all power supplies, antennas, and other components along with the original product box.
* Please use the original shipping carton and packaging material. If this is not possible, use another shipping carton with padding to protect the units from damage during shipping, and remove ALL inappropriate and/or inapplicable label(s). DO NOT ship a product without a carton.
* The customer will be charged for product that is damaged due to insufficient packaging.
* Once you have received your RMA number from Cisco Meraki via email, write this RMA number in large letters on the exterior of the shipping carton. Shipments to Cisco Meraki without an RMA approval will not be processed.
* If Cisco Meraki approves your RMA request, you will receive a confirmation email containing an RMA number within two business days. The address to which the product should be sent will also be included in that email.
* Cisco Meraki will provide a pre-paid return shipping label for warranty replacement return shipments. Cisco Meraki will also provide a pre-paid return shipping label for free trial return shipments from US (including Puerto Rico), any EU member country, Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. For all other returns it is your responsibility to coordinate and pay for return shipping back to Cisco Meraki using the carrier of your choice. Cisco Meraki recommends that the return package has a tracking number and is insured for the proper value of its contents. Cisco Meraki is not responsible for packages lost by carriers.

* * *

Cisco Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Cisco”) are committed to protecting your privacy and providing you with a positive experience on our websites and while using our products and services (“Solutions”).

This Privacy Statement applies to Cisco websites and Solutions that link to or reference this Privacy Statement and describes how we handle Personal Data and the choices available to you regarding collection, use, access, and how to update and correct your Personal Data.

Certain Cisco websites and Solutions may have their own privacy documentation describing how we handle Personal Data for those websites or Solutions specifically. To the extent a specific notice for a website or Solution differs from this Privacy Statement, the specific notice will take precedent. If there is a difference in translated, non-English versions of this Privacy Statement, the U.S.-English version will take precedence.

* If we otherwise notify you and you consent to the sharing

##### Security of your Personal Data

We take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Data entrusted to us and treat it securely in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Cisco implements physical, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access. We also contractually require that our suppliers protect such information from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.

##### Retention and disposal of Personal Data

We will retain your Personal Data as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We will retain and use your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our business requirements and legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, and enforce our rights and agreements.

We will not retain Personal Data in identifiable form when the purpose(s) for which the Personal Data was collected have been achieved and there is no legal or business need to retain such Personal Data. Thereafter, the data will either be destroyed, deleted, anonymized, and/or removed from our systems.

##### Use of cookies and similar technologies

Cisco uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, pixels, tags, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to us (such as Internet Protocol \[IP\] address, MAC address, clickstream behavior, and telemetry).

These tools help make your visit to our websites and Solutions easier, more efficient, and personalized. We also use the information to improve our websites and Solutions, provide greater service and value, better understand your potential interest in our websites and Solutions, and provide you with more relevant ads and other content.

We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. Where this type of third party advertising is disabled, generic, non-personalized ads will continue to be displayed.

For more information, or if you would like to opt out of interest-based advertising, see [How Cisco Uses Automatic Data Collection Tools](https://meraki.cisco.com/meraki-support/policies/#automatic-data-collection-tools).

To update your cookie preferences, click the “Cookies” link at the bottom of any page on this website. Additionally, you may be able to use other tools to control cookies and similar technologies. For example, you may have controls in your internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies.

##### Automated decision-making

We process Personal Data using both manual and automated methods of processing. Automated methods are often used to assist our manual methods in accordance with applicable laws. Where an individual’s rights and legitimate interests may be impacted by such automated decision-making, we will provide the impacted individual the opportunity to inquire about the decision or request manual review. Manual review may be conducted by Cisco employees or trusted third-party business partners working on Cisco’s behalf.

##### Linked websites

We may provide links to other third-party websites and services that are outside Cisco’s control and governed by the respective third party’s privacy policy, not by this Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy statements posted on the websites you visit and in the applications you use.

##### Forums and chat rooms

If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on a Cisco website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (such as your public profile and comments) will be made broadly available to others and could be used to contact you, to send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither Cisco nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Cisco is not responsible for the Personal Data or any other information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your Personal Data from our blog or community forum, please submit a [Privacy Request](https://privacyrequest.cisco.com/). In some cases, we may not be able to remove all Personal Data and comments. In such cases, we will provide you with a response and explanation.

##### Children’s privacy

Cisco encourages parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities. Cisco does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children without appropriate parental or guardian consent. If you believe that we may have collected Personal Data from someone under the applicable age of consent in your country without proper consent, please let us know using the methods described in the [Questions, comments, and how to contact us](#privacy-contact) section and we will take appropriate measures to investigate and address the issue promptly.

##### International transfer, processing, and storage of Personal Data

As Cisco is a global organization, Personal Data may be transferred to Cisco in the United States of America, to any Cisco subsidiary worldwide, or to third parties and business partners as described above that are located in various jurisdictions around the world. Similarly, Personal Data may be accessed from countries where Cisco or its subsidiaries have operations. Cisco will transfer your Personal Data in accordance with approved transfer mechanisms as well as any applicable local legal requirements.

By using our websites and Solutions or providing any Personal Data to us, where applicable law permits, you acknowledge and accept the transfer, processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different.

Cisco safeguards and enables the global transfer of Personal Data in a number of ways:

* ##### APEC Privacy Certification
    
    Cisco’s global privacy program, described in this Privacy Statement, complies with the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules system (CBPRs) and Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP). The APEC CBPR system and PRP provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of Personal Data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC Privacy Framework, CBPRs, and PRP can be found on the [CBPRs site](http://cbprs.org/). Our certification applies to our business processes across our global operations that process and transfer Personal Data to/from our affiliates around the world.

* ##### EU Binding Corporate Rules – Controller
    
    Cisco’s global privacy program and policies have been approved by the Dutch, Polish, Spanish, and other relevant European privacy regulators as providing additional safeguards for the protection of privacy, fundamental rights, and freedoms of individuals for transfers of Personal Data protected under European law. Cisco’s Binding Corporate Rules—Controller (BCR-C) provide that international transfers made worldwide by Cisco entities bound by these rules as a controller of European Personal Data benefit from appropriate safeguards.
    
    A copy of our BCR-C can be found in our [Global Privacy Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/global-privacy-policy.html). More information about BCRs can be found on the [European Commission site](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/binding-corporate-rules-bcr_en).

    **EU/U.K. (and Gibraltar)/Swiss – U.S. transfer of Personal Data**
    
    When we transfer Personal Data out of the European Union (“EU”), European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”)(and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to countries that do not benefit from an adequacy decision, we may rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules—Controller, or other legal transfer mechanisms with appropriate safeguards in place to protect Personal Data. Additionally, Cisco Systems, Inc. and its [U.S. based subsidiaries](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000GnJ2AAK&status=Active) (collectively “Cisco-U.S.”) comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) for transfers of Personal Data from the EU, EEA, U.K. (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland to the U.S.
    
    **Data Privacy Framework**
    
    Cisco-U.S. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles with regards to the processing of Personal Data received from the EU and EEA in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the U.K. (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Cisco-U.S. has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles with regards to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Online Privacy Statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. For more information about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please visit the [DPF Website.](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)
    
    Pursuant to the DPF Principles, Cisco-U.S. commits to the following:
    
    * Cisco-U.S. is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the DPF, and subsequently may transfer it to third parties acting as agents on its behalf. Cisco-U.S. complies with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU, EEA, U.K. (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland (for examples of such transfers, see [Disclosing your Personal Data](#spi) ), including the onward transfer liability provisions. In certain situations, Cisco-U.S. may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Further, Cisco-U.S. is committed to protecting Personal Data received from EU and EEA member countries, Switzerland, and the U.K. (and Gibraltar) (see [Collection and use of your Personal Data](#personal-information) for examples of the Personal Data Cisco processes when you use our websites and Solutions and interact with us) in accordance with the DPF’s applicable Principles and to help ensure Personal Data collected from individuals is accessible to them as part of their individual rights when Cisco is the Controller of the Personal Data (see [Your privacy rights](#privacy-rights)). Furthermore, Cisco acknowledges the right of EU, EEA, U.K. (and Gibraltar), and Swiss individuals to request access to their data while it is in the U.S. and to correct, amend, and supplement inaccurate or incomplete data. Said individuals also have the right to request erasure of personal information that has been handled in violation of the DPF Principles. Subject individuals interested in accessing their data should see [Disclosing your Personal Data](#spi) for information on how to contact us, or submit a Privacy Request online.
    * In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the U.K. Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, Cisco-U.S. commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Data transferred to the U.S. pursuant to the DPF Principles. EU, EEA, U.K. (and Gibraltar), and Swiss individuals with DPF inquiries or complaints, or any questions or concerns regarding Cisco-U.S. processing or international transfer of their Personal Data should first contact Cisco-U.S. by submitting a [Privacy Request](https://privacyrequest.cisco.com/) online.
    * Cisco-U.S. has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the DPF Principles to a U.S.-based independent third-party dispute resolution mechanism, DPF Services, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers](https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers) for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
    * If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2).
    * Cisco-U.S. is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

##### Your California privacy rights

###### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)

For business purposes in the last 12 months, Cisco may have collected, used, and shared Personal Data about you as described in this Privacy Statement. Each category of data that may be used by Cisco or shared with third parties is categorically outlined in this Privacy Statement.

California consumers have a right to: (1) request access, correction, and deletion of their Personal Data, (2) opt out of the sale or sharing of their Personal Data, and (3) not be discriminated against for exercising one of their California privacy rights.

All individuals have the right to request access to and deletion of the information Cisco holds about them either online via the Cisco [Privacy Request Form](https://privacyrequest.cisco.com/) or by mail to Cisco Systems, Inc., Privacy Office, 170 West Tasman Dr., San Jose, CA 95134, USA.

In addition, California residents may also submit a request by calling direct 408-906-2726 or toll free 833-774-2726 (833-PRI-CSCO).

Cisco does not sell the Personal Data of California consumers.

Cisco does not discriminate against individuals for exercising their privacy rights.

###### California Shine the Light

Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Data during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt out or opt in choice for use of your Personal Data by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

Cisco has a comprehensive Privacy Statement and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Data by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain nor disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Data for marketing purposes during the preceding year.

##### Updates to this Cisco Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we modify our Privacy Statement, we will post the revised version here with an updated revision date. If we make material changes to our Privacy Statement, we may also notify you by other means, such as by posting a notice on our websites or sending you a notification. By continuing to use our website after such revisions are in effect, you accept and agree to the revisions and to abide by them.

Automatic Data Collection Tools (Cookies, etc.)
-----------------------------------------------

* * *

##### Cisco use of cookies and other tracking technologies

Our services (including our websites, web-based products and services, mobile apps, e-mail, and marketing/advertising communications, together the “services”) use cookies and other similar device identification technologies (collectively “cookies”) to provide our services, to understand how they are used, and for analytics, personalization, customization and marketing/advertising purposes. You can read more about the types of cookies we (Cisco and our third-party service providers) use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your cookies choices below.

Our services may also include “widgets,” which are interactive mini programs that run on our sites to provide specific services from other companies (such as displaying the news, opinions, music, and more). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the widget. Cookies may also be set by the widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by these widgets is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.

##### What are cookies?

We use the term “cookie” to refer to all technologies which store and access information on the device that you use to access our services, such as your computer, tablet, or mobile phone. For example, we use HTTP cookies (web/browser cookies), which are small data files (typically made up of numbers and letters) that are downloaded when you access our services and allow us to recognize your device. Click here for more information on cookies.

Cookies can be necessary and useful in a number of ways. For example, cookies enable websites to recognize your device and are often used to help the website function properly and to provide information to the owner(s) of the site. Cookies are necessary to recognize or “remember” anything about visitors, such as:

1. Whether a visitor is logged in
2. User-selected preferences
3. Items put in a user’s shopping cart

There are different types of cookies, including:

* Cookies served (i.e., set, shared, provided, offered) directly by Cisco (“first party cookies”) and cookies served on our behalf, for example by advertising and data analytics service providers (“third party cookies”)
* Cookies that only last as long as your browser is open are referred to as “session cookies.” Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser.
* Other cookies are “persistent cookies” and remain after your browser is closed, until cleared. For example, they store your device identifier and recognize your device when you open and use your browser.

#### Which cookies do we use, and why do we use them?

The following table sets out the different types of cookies that our services use, why they are served them, and who serves them.

**Type of cookie**

Things like cookies and pixels are used to understand and deliver ads, make them more relevant, and track the efficacy of mobile application advertising campaigns.  
For example, we may read a cookie so we can serve you ads that may be interesting (including personalized or customized) on other websites. We also use this information to retarget users with relevant advertising. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie, attribution service, or other similar technology to determine whether we have served an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. This may involve storing cookies on your local device.

#### How can you exercise your cookies choices?

You have the right to choose not to accept certain cookies. However, even optional cookies are an important part of how our services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove certain cookies, this could affect the usability and functionality of our services.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, follow the instructions provided in your browser. Instructions are generally located within the “Help,” “Tools,” or “Edit” menus.

Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse advertising cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link or you can opt-out proactively. How to opt out of interest-based advertising:

* If you are located [in the European Union](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)
* If you are located [in Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
* If you are located [in all other parts of the world](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)

Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies used in connection with our services. [Get more information](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html) on how to delete or disable flash cookies.

You can also change your preferences in relation to how this website uses cookies.

#### For more information

For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit AllAboutCookies.org and Your Online Choices (for European Union residents).

For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [AllAboutCookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (for European Union residents).

#### “Do not track” function

Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” feature that sends signals to the services you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies as browsers with a “do not track” feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although one may develop in the future. Cisco does not respond to “do not track” signals currently. If Cisco does so in the future, we will describe how in this privacy statement. Learn more information about [“do not track.”](https://allaboutdnt.com/)

Shipping Policy
---------------

* * *

##### Orders

All orders will generally be processed the same day and shipped within 2 business days. Once the order is processed, the customer will receive a confirmation email. Delays may occur in case of missing information, special shipping requests, and if import/export related verification is required.

##### Order Number

A single Cisco CCW Sales Order can be transmitted to Meraki as multiple Meraki orders due to the below scenarios and will ship separately. Shipping charges will be billed per Meraki order, not per the SO as a whole.

* Duplicate PID
* Different License duration
* Different license addition for MX only (ENT/SEC)
* Different ship ID address
* Different end user ID
* Different request ship date
* Different freight account #
* Different ship method

##### P.O. Boxes

For most addresses, PO Boxes are not acceptable delivery addresses. If your shipping address must include a PO Box, Cisco Meraki cannot guarantee delivery.

##### Sales Tax and VAT

In accordance with applicable law, Cisco Meraki collects sales tax or VAT in regions where Cisco Meraki has a presence. Sales tax or VAT will be applied to the total amount of the order and is based on the shipment’s destination and local sales tax or VAT rates.

##### Special Delivery Requirements

In case you require any special service for your delivery such as a lift gate or indoor delivery service, or have special export/import requirements, please make sure to let your seller know to include this information on the PO or open a case on the [Cisco Customer Service Portal](http://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com/) prior order submission to allow sufficient time for the Cisco-Meraki shipping team to review and advise.

##### International Certifications

Cisco Meraki has products certified in countries all over the world. If you have specific questions regarding Cisco Meraki certifications, please contact your sales representative.

##### Canceling or Modifying an Order

Orders can be modified or canceled before they have entered the shipping process. Once the shipment is in transit the shipping address can no longer be modified. Please take special care when processing the order to ensure the shipping address is correct and able to accept the delivery. However, if you do require adjustments prior to the shipment, please contact your seller/reseller/distributor or open an urgent case in the [Cisco Customer Service Portal](http://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com/) as soon as possible. You may be responsible for any applicable adjustment, handling and/or shipping fees if applicable.

#### Shipping and Delivery

##### Shipping Confirmation

Once your order has been shipped, a shipping notification email will be sent to the email listed in your Purchase Order, containing the tracking number of the shipment and the License Key. In case you ordered the license separately from the hardware product, the License Key will be sent on a separate email.

##### Shipping Methods

Opt In (Cisco-routed) program allows the customer to rely on Cisco’s preferred carrier network, typically gives full end to end tracking visibility for parcel shipments, most freight shipments, and eliminates the need for partner/customer carrier information to be provided. However, the Cisco-routed program does not place liability for lost/damaged shipments wholly on Cisco Meraki. To determine when risk/liability is transferred, refer to the Incoterms. Once ownership of the goods has changed from Cisco Meraki per the Incoterms, goods should not be sent back to Cisco without first obtaining a [Return Material Authorization](https://meraki.cisco.com/support/policies#return-policy-and-requesting-a-rma) (RMA) from Cisco.

Opt Out (self-routed) shipping preference allows the partner or customer to select their own carrier. Cisco Meraki has the ability to ship with most carriers, and the shipping cost will be the responsibility of the bill to party. If there are any concerns with the carrier selected, Cisco Meraki will contact the partner or customer.

##### Incoterms, Duties & Taxes

Cisco Meraki will send shipments with a variety of Incoterms depending on the customer agreement. Incoterms determine and differentiate between the seller’s and the buyer’s responsibility. In the majority of cases, the “bill to” party on the order will be the importer of record and will be responsible for all duties & taxes, VAT, brokerage or other fees. In some cases, third party billing for duty & tax is not available in the destination country and the receiver/”ship to” will be responsible for these fees.

##### Loss/Damage

In the unlikely scenario that you receive your delivery damaged or missing cartons, please accept the shipment and notate as such with the carrier upon delivery. Upon receiving the shipment, take photos to provide supporting information when filing a RMA claim with [Cisco Customer Service](http://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com/) to assist in the investigation.

#### Country Specific Information and Transit Times

Each country can have variations in transit time, available ship services and special requirements. Below are the most frequent destinations and estimated delivery times.
