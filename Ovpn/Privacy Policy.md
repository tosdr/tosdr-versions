Privacy Policy
==============

General
-------

OVPN is a service provided and developed by OVPN Integritet AB (556999-4469). OVPN Integritet AB is registered in Sweden and will henceforth be referred to as "We", "Us", "Our" and "OVPN".

OVPN is the privacy friendly VPN provider. As such, our entire infrastructure is built with privacy & security as the core principles. OVPN does not log any activity when connected to our VPN service. Therefore, we do not know who is connected to our service, what they are doing or when they are doing it. Nothing can be connected to an account:

* no logging of traffic
* no logging of timestamps
* no logging of DNS requests
* no logging of IP addresses
* no logging of MAC addresses
* no logging of individual user bandwidth volumes

We own every single server used to run our service. All VPN servers run without any hard drives - instead we use tmpfs storage in RAM. Writing permissions for the OpenVPN processes have been removed, as well as syslogs. Our VPN servers do not support physical console access, keyboard access nor usb access.

Court orders
------------

OVPN can not provide any activity information or logs about users if a court order was issued asking us to provide that information. As previously mentioned, no information about what our users do when connected is stored.

The only information we would be able to provide would be account information detailed further below as well as the method of payment. However, it requires that the court order is for a specific person and that the authorities want to verify if that person has a user account with us. We have not provided any information about our users to any government entities.

Website
-------

Our website runs on a physical machine that we own and is located in our Stockholm datacenter. We use the following third-party services:

**Matomo (previously named Piwik)**: Matomo is included so we can measure how users interact with the website and to find areas of improvement. All IP addresses are anonymized.

**Intercom**: Intercom is a support system which we use to offer support to our users. User account information is shared to Intercom in order to handle support requests satisfactory.

**Mailgun & Postmark**: Mailgun & Postmark are used to send emails.

**Braintree**: We use Braintree which is PCI DSS certified as our credit card solution provider. No payment information is stored with us.

**Swish Merchant**: For people in Sweden we offer Swish as a payment method.

**CoinPayments**: CoinPayments is used for crypto payments.

We also use reporting tools from Google to measure ad efficiency. These reporting tools are only loaded for visitors who came through one of these channels.

Cookies
-------

The following cookies may be saved on users devices when visiting OVPN.com.

* Matomo saves cookies containing session & profile data
* Intercom saves cookies containing session & profile data
* OVPN saves a cookie containing session, language, potential ad channel
* OVPN saves a cookie in case users wish to be signed in automatically

User information
----------------

During account registration, users must supply a desired username and a password. While we recommend our users to provide an email address, it is entirely optional. The email address is used for events such as account recovery in case of a forgotten password, to send upcoming billing notifications, receipts after payments as well as an optional newsletter about our service.

We store the following data for each account:
