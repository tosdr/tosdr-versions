VPN Terms of Service
====================

Last Updated: June 2024

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THESE VPN TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE VPN SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW).

This VPN Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) governs your use of OVPN ([https://www.ovpn.com/en](https://www.ovpn.com/)) (the “**VPN(s)**”), and any associated documentation (the “**Software**”) (collectively, the “**Services**”) is a legal contract between the individual accepting and agreeing to these Terms (“**you**”) and OVPN Integritet AB (“**OVPN**”, “**we**”, or “**us**”).

These Terms represent a binding contract between you and OVPN. You are agreeing to these Terms when you sign up for or use the Services and any time you access or use the Services. We encourage you to read our Terms carefully, specifically the automatic renewal terms and mandatory arbitration, which significantly affect your legal rights.

IN PARTICULAR, THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES U.S. USERS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH OVPN OR ITS AFFILIATES THROUGH ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. SEE SECTION 2.11 BELOW FOR THE DETAILS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

### What is covered by these Terms?

To make it easier to understand, we’ve divided our legal terms into three parts:

(1) Billing, Cancellation, and Refund Policies: This covers terms related to billing, automatic renewals, cancellation, and refunds, when billing is handled by OVPN. Separate terms may apply if you didn’t purchase the Services directly from OVPN.

(2) General Legal Terms: This covers the general legal terms that make up the contractual relationship between you and OVPN such as eligibility, user accounts, binding arbitration, and indemnification.

(3) License Terms: These are terms that govern how we give you a license to access and use the Services.

### Part 1. Automatic Renewals And Billing

**1.1 Subscription**

Our Services are generally billed on a subscription basis (“**Subscription**”). If applicable and you elect to enroll in a Subscription, you will be billed in advance for your Subscription on a recurring and periodic basis (“**Billing Cycle**”). The length of your Billing Cycle will depend on the Subscription you select. Billing Cycles will typically consist of one (1) month or one (1) year terms (“**Subscription Term**”). You agree to pay for the Subscription that you select. You also authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file based on the Billing Cycle applicable to your Subscription.

**1.2 Automatic Renewals and Cancellation**

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew for an additional Billing Cycle at the price shown in your account dashboard or otherwise communicated to you by us (“**Renewal Price**”) unless: (i) you or we have canceled your Subscription at least one (1) day prior to the commencement of your next Billing Cycle or in accordance with Section 1.4 below; or (ii) an event under Section 1.5 occurs in which case we will give you prior notice according to that Section. If your Subscription Term is longer than six months, we will email you in advance to let you know your Subscription is due for renewal and provide the renewal price in your billing page. You may cancel your Subscription by contacting us at [support@OVPN.com](mailto:support@ovpn.com), or by logging into your account. Once we or you have canceled your Subscription, your recurring subscription fees for the Services will no longer be charged to the payment method we have on file for your account, and your Subscription will remain active only until the end of the current Billing Cycle.

You may also be eligible for a refund depending on the specific plan and offer you subscribed to in accordance with the applicable section(s) below.

**1.3 Plan Switching**

In the event you switch your VPN Subscription plan, we will send you an email confirming (provided we have an email on file) the plan change, and reflect any credit or amount owed due to the difference in changing plans, and the Billing Cycle for the new plan. Your plan switch will be effective as of the date shown in your account profile and confirmation email, which will generally be tied to the date you elect to switch your plan.

**1.4 Payment Methods**

A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide us or our third-party payment processor with accurate and complete billing information which may include full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Unless we expressly provide otherwise, all amounts paid are non-refundable. You further agree to be responsible for any applicable state, federal or other taxes that may be associated with the Services, including sales taxes, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by your financial institution and intermediaries. All amounts are in U.S. Dollars, Euros, or Swedish Krona.

If the billing method you provide is a credit or debit card (“**Payment Card**”), you:

(i) Represent that you are authorized to use such Payment Card.

(ii) Authorize us to charge your Payment Card periodically for the Subscription fees when due, including upon sign up for the Services and each subsequent Billing Cycle.

(iii) Agree to keep your Payment Card details valid and current.

(iv) Agree to pay any processing fees that are charged by the third-party payment processors or Payment Card issuer.

If your Payment Card is declined when we attempt to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time. If we do not receive payment, we may suspend or terminate your Subscription.

**1.5 Fee Changes**

We may change the fees that we charge for the Services at any time at our sole discretion, provided that we will give you at least thirty (30) days of prior notice of such changes. Unless otherwise specified in such notice to you, any changes to the Subscription fees will take effect in the Billing Cycle immediately following our notice to you.

**1.6 Data Charges**

You are responsible for any charges that may apply to your use of our Services, including text messaging and data charges if you access or use the Services on your mobile or other device. If you're unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your mobile operator, internet, or other service provider before using the Services.

**1.7 VPN Authorized Resellers**

If you enrolled in our Services via a reseller, no refunds are provided by OVPN. The Services will continue to be accessible until the last day of your current month’s billing cycle. Should you have questions, please contact your reseller as any disposition of refunds, if owed, is between you and the reseller.

### Part 2. General Legal Terms

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS – IF YOU RESIDE IN THE U.S. WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES WITH OVPN AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGH ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. PLEASE REVIEW SECTION 2.11 OF THESE TERMS FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.

**2.1 Eligibility**

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Services or third-party service.

**2.3 User Submissions; Feedback; Beta Features; Updates**

If you provide to us, either directly or through a third-party such as the Apple App Store, feedback and/or reviews, suggestions, comments, or ideas relating to the Services (“Submissions”), you grant, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, OVPN and its affiliated companies a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, unlimited, nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the Submission in any media or medium, or any form, format, or forum, now known or hereafter developed, to improve or market the Services or for any other reasonable business purpose. We may sublicense these rights through multiple tiers of sublicenses. No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submission. OVPN is under no obligation to post or use any Submission you may provide and OVPN may remove any Submission at any time in its sole discretion, as permitted by law. By providing a Submission to OVPN, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission that are necessary for you to provide it, including any recognized protectable rights and interest in and to any inventions discoveries, designs, formulas, know-how, processes, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks (“**Intellectual Property Rights**”). You agree that: (i) all content of your Submissions must be accurate; (ii) you will not provide a Submission that is known by you to be false, inaccurate or misleading and/or may be reasonably considered to be defamatory, libelous, hateful, offensive, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing to anyone; (iii) you will not provide a Submission that infringes a third-party’s Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (iv) you will not provide a Submission that violates any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (v) you will not provide a Submission for which you were compensated or granted any consideration by any third-party; (vi) you shall not provide any Submission that includes information that references other websites, addresses, email addresses, contact information, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information for anyone; and (vii) you will not provide a Submission that contains any potentially damaging computer programs or files.

OVPN shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in such information for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, and marketing products incorporating such information.

Also we may, in our sole discretion, include new and/or updated beta features in the Services for your use and which permit you to provide feedback via mechanisms that OVPN offers for your feedback. Using beta features may subject you to the payment of fees. You understand and agree that your use of the beta features is voluntary. The beta features are provided on an “as is” basis and you acknowledge and agree that all use of beta features is at your personal risk. Certain beta features may be subject to additional terms or an agreement.

We may from time to time develop and provide updates for the Services, which may include upgrades, bug fixes, patches and other error corrections and/or new features, functionality, tools or content (collectively, “**Updates**”). Updates may also modify or delete features, functionality, tools or content in their entirety.

For any Services available via app, depending on your mobile device settings, when your mobile device is connected to the internet either: (a) the Updates will automatically download and install; or (b) you may receive notice of or be prompted to download and install available Updates. We suggest that you promptly download and install all Updates. If you do not download and install the most recent Updates, portions of the Services may not properly operate. All Updates will be deemed part of the Services and be subject to all terms and conditions of the Terms.

Free Trials are only available to users who have not subscribed to the Services in connection with a Free Trial being offered in the last twelve (12) months or other duration as clearly defined by OVPN in the signup flow and/or in the applicable promotional materials.

You may be required to enter your billing information to sign up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by us until the Free Trial has expired. You may cancel your Subscription within at least twenty four (24) hours prior to the end of your Free Trial through the Services dashboard and unless you cancel during the aforementioned timeframe. You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected. At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to: (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer; or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer. Before charging you at the end of your free trial period, we will notify you of the applicable fees.

**2.5 Third-Party Products and Policies**

We may offer or provide you access to products, services, or websites provided by third parties, including but not limited to free services provided by third parties and websites that hyperlink to our website or to whom we hyperlink (collectively “**Third-Party Content**”).

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE NEITHER WARRANT NOR REPRESENT THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL NOT INFRINGE THE RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, NOR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR ACCESS OR USE, NOR THAT OPERATION OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. NO INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM OVPN OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN ADDITION, YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

**2.9 Limitation of Liability and Damages**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, OVPN AND THE OVPN ENTITIES WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE OR PROFIT OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM PERSONAL INJURY/WRONGFUL DEATH) ARISING CONCERNING YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO DAMAGES ARISING FROM: (i) USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (ii) COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES; (iii) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS BY THIRD PARTIES; (iv) THIRD-PARTY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (v) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES.

Also, when using the Services, information will be transmitted over a medium that is beyond the control and jurisdiction of OVPN, its partners, advertisers, and sponsors, or any other third-party mentioned on the Services. Accordingly, OVPN assumes no liability for or relating to the delay, failure, interruption, or corruption of any data or other information transmitted in connection with the use of the Services.

**2.10 Basis of the Bargain**

You acknowledge and agree that OVPN has offered the Services, set its prices, and entered into these Terms in reliance upon the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein, that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and OVPN, and that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of the bargain between you and OVPN. OVPN would not be able to provide the Services to you on an economically reasonable basis without these limitations.

**2.11 Dispute Resolution By Binding Individual Arbitration**

Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.

(A) Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by contacting us at [support@OVPN.com](mailto:support@ovpn.com). TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, in the unlikely event that customer service is unable to resolve a complaint you may have with OVPN or OVPN’s service provider(s) to your satisfaction (or if OVPN and/or OVPN’s service provider(s) have not been able to resolve a dispute with you after attempting to do so informally), you, on the one hand, and OVPN and/or OVPN’s service provider(s), on the other, each agree to resolve those disputes under the Arbitration Agreement contained in this Section 2.11. The Arbitration Agreement requires you to resolve all disputes (other than those expressly exempted in this Section 2.11) through binding arbitration on an individual basis, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction to the fullest extent permitted by law. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. We will pay all costs of arbitration, no matter who wins, so long as your claim is not frivolous. However, in arbitration, you, on the one hand, and OVPN and/or OVPN’s service provider(s), on the other, will be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees to the same extent they would be available in court.

(B) ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, you, on the one hand, and OVPN and/or OVPN’s service provider(s), on the other, agree that any claim or dispute ("**Claim**") between us shall, at the election of any one of us, be resolved by binding arbitration ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its rules for consumer arbitrations, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA and appear at adr.org. OVPN can also help put you in touch with the AAA. The parties intend that this agreement to arbitrate (“**Arbitration Agreement**”) be construed broadly, such that this Arbitration Agreement includes any Claims by you against OVPN or OVPN’s service provider(s) as well as their respective corporate affiliates for any claims, disputes, or causes of action related in any way to: (i) your use of the Services; or (ii) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, applicability, or validity of these Terms or any part of them (including this Arbitration Agreement).

You agree that, by entering into these Terms or otherwise using the Services, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. At your request, we will promptly reimburse you for the payment of your arbitration filing fee. (If you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly after receiving a written request). The arbitrator shall be authorized to award whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, other than relief reserved for the courts by law or statute. YOU, ON ONE HAND, AND OVPN AND/OR OVPN’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and OVPN agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision in the preceding sentence is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The parties to these Terms acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement is made according to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ("**FAA**"), except to the extent state law provides defenses or exceptions not preempted by the FAA. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall follow substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA and shall honor any claims or privileges recognized by law. The terms of this Section 2.11 shall survive any termination, cancellation, or expiration of these Terms.

(C) Exceptions to Arbitration: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following claims properly lodged in a small claims court of the United States are not subject to this Arbitration Agreement, provided that they are brought and maintained as individual claims and not in any class, consolidated, or representative capacity claims.

**2.12 Prohibited Conduct**

(i) In using our Services, you agree not to:

(ii) Send or transmit unsolicited advertisements or content (i.e., “spam") over the Services.

(iii) Send, post, or transmit over the Services any content which is illegal, hateful, threatening, insulting, deceptive, fraudulent, damaging, or defamatory; infringes OVPN or third parties’ Intellectual Property Rights; invades privacy; or incites violence or any unlawful behavior.

(iv) Upload, download, post, reproduce, or distribute any content protected by copyright or any other proprietary right without first having obtained permission from the owner / licensor of the proprietary content.

(v) Use the Services for any illegal purpose, or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law;

(xii) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Services or any part thereof;

(xiii) Remove, circumvent, disable, damage, or otherwise interfere or deny service in any way or form with security-related features of the Services, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of the Software, or features that enforce limitations on the use of the Services.

**2.16 No Relationship**

**2.17 Additional License Terms for Apple App Store and Google Play Store**

If the Software is provided to you through Apple Inc. (Apple Inc. together with all of its affiliates, “**Apple**”) App Store, the following terms and conditions apply to you in addition to all the other terms set forth herein:

OVPN is the licensor of the Software and the provider of the Services and any third party (e.g., operator of the store, platform, marketplace) is not a party to these Terms.

**2.18 Monitoring of Customer Service Sessions**

We and our partners may monitor and record customer service sessions, including telephone calls and online sessions for purposes of improving customer service, internal training, and internal market research. You hereby grant us permission: (i) to monitor and record any customer service sessions involving you; (ii) to use or disclose any information as necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation, or other governmental requests; (iii) to respond to claims asserted against us or our affiliates; (iv) to enforce and to ensure (including any investigations needed) a user’s compliance with these Terms; (v) to conduct risk assessments and prevent, detect and investigate incidents of fraud, security and technical issues; (vi) to protect our and our affiliates’ rights, property or safety of OVPN, its other users or members of the public to provide the Services to you or other users; and (vii) to enhance the types of Services we may provide in the future.

By participating in the Services, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and understand the applicable privacy policy and consent to the practices described in that policy.

**2.20 Termination by OVPN**

OVPN may terminate your use of the Services or discontinue providing access to the Services at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to any actual or suspected breach by you of these Terms or any other unacceptable or objectionable use of the Services, as determined by OVPN in its sole discretion. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services may be effected without prior notice and you agree that OVPN will not be liable to you or any third-party for any such termination.

If such termination or discontinuation by OVPN occurs during a period for which you are a paid subscriber, you may be entitled to a pro-rated refund of your current subscription payment amount in connection with your use of the Services. If your account is terminated due to your breach of these Terms, you will not be eligible for a refund. All refunds are issued at OVPN’s sole discretion and any refund request may be denied for any or no reason. If you have been terminated from the Services and wish to request a refund, please contact us via the email address in your account dashboard which at the time of publishing is [support@OVPN.com](mailto:support@ovpn.com), and describe the circumstances relating to the termination or discontinuation of your use of the Services. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies OVPN may have at law or in equity.

**2.21 Termination by You**

You may terminate these Terms at any time by discontinuing use of the Services, deleting your account with the Services, and uninstalling any Software downloaded in connection with your use of the Services.

**2.22 Assignment**

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you but may be assigned by OVPN without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms shall be void.

**2.23 Additional Terms**

Certain areas, features, or functionality of the Services may be subject to different or additional terms, rules, guidelines, or policies (“**Additional Rules**”) and not every Subscription will include the same features (for example, Subscriptions purchased via an authorized third-party may not include all of the same features as a Subscription purchased through our desktop Site). Not all features may be available on all devices. Depending upon the Services you subscribe or register to use, you may be permitted to be enrolled as follows: (i) by the Service’s website; (ii) by another method permitted by the Service; or (iii) by a third-party who is authorized on OVPN’s behalf or provide your personal information to enroll you on your behalf. Features may be added, changed or removed during the Subscription term. We may provide such Additional Rules to you via postings, pop-up notices, links, or other means at the time that you access or use the relevant area, feature or functionality. From time to time, such Additional Rules may conflict with these Terms. In the event of such a conflict, the Additional Rules will control. Any reference to the “Terms” in these Terms includes the Additional Rules.

**2.24 Entire Agreement**

These Terms (including any documents incorporated here by reference) constitute the entire agreement between you and OVPN concerning its subject matter, and it supersedes any other prior or contemporaneous agreements or terms, written or oral.

**2.25 Force Majeure**

VPN Service coverage, speeds, server locations, and quality may vary. Neither OVPN nor you will be liable for inadequate performance under these Terms to the extent caused by events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include denial-of-service attacks, internet disturbance, strikes, riots, pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters, acts of God, war, terrorism, and governmental action.

**2.26 Governing Law**

These Terms were prepared and written in English. Any non-English translations of these Terms which may be made available are provided for convenience only and are not valid or legally binding. Use of section headings in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. The use of the words "includes," "including," "such as," "for example," and similar terms are deemed not to limit what else might be included.

**2.28 Jurisdiction**

You agree that in the event of a dispute that is not subject to the Arbitration Agreement in these Terms, or if the Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or your use of the Services, except any claim properly lodged in a Small Claims Court of the United States, will be brought in the courts of the state of New York and you hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts to litigate any such action. You further agree that any such claims will be brought solely on an individual basis and not as part of any class, consolidated, or representative capacity. If you reside in a country (including countries of the European Union) where laws provide consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, in such cases, mandatory provisions of the local laws of your country of residence apply.

**2.29 Notice**

All notices must be in writing and will be deemed given when: (i) personally delivered; (ii) verified by a written receipt, if sent by postal mail with verification of receipt service or courier; (iii) received, if sent by postal mail without verification of receipt; or (iv) verified by automated receipt or electronic logs if sent by email, provided that no bounce or other technical error message was received in response. Notices to OVPN must be sent to Intersections, LLC, 250 Northern Ave., 3rd Floor, Boston, MA 02210, marked to the attention of the Legal Department, with a copy emailed to [legal@OVPN.com](mailto:legal@ovpn.com). Email alone is insufficient for providing non-routine legal notices to OVPN such as notices related to disputes or arbitration, indemnification claims, breach notices, and termination notices (“**Non-Routine Notices**”) to OVPN. You may grant approvals, permission, extensions, and consents by email. Notices to you may be sent to the email address associated with your account for the Services. You consent to receive certain electronic communications from us in connection with your use of the Services. You agree that any notices or other communications sent to you electronically will satisfy any legal notice requirements. You must keep contact details associated with your account and accurate, and you will notify OVPN in writing of any changes to such details.

**2.30 Severability**

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason is unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

**2.31 Survival**

Upon termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason, such terms as by their nature would survive termination shall survive. In particular, Sections 2.6 (Indemnification), 2.9 (Limitation of Liability and Damages), 2.11 (Dispute Resolution By Binding Individual Arbitration), 2.13 (Trademark and Copyright), 2.24 (Entire Agreement), 2.26 (Governing Law), 2.27 (Interpretation), 2.28 (Jurisdiction) will survive.

**2.32 Third-Party Beneficiaries**

Except as expressly provided herein, there will be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

**2.33 Waiver**

The failure of OVPN to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by OVPN. Any cause of action arising out of or related to the Service by you against OVPN must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.

**2.34 Modification of these Terms**

OVPN may make changes to these Terms at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or to account for additional features or functionality in the Services. We may notify you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised version of these Terms through the Services. You agree that it is your responsibility to regularly check the Services for any updated Terms. By continuing to use or access any of the Services or otherwise engaging with OVPN after we post any changes, you accept the updated Terms. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates when these Terms were last changed. If a revision materially alters your rights, as determined by OVPN in its sole discretion, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of the change becoming effective, which may include sending a notification to the email address(es) associated with your account or displaying a pop-up or banner within the Services. In any case, the most current version of these Terms will be posted on the Services. Changes will be effective no sooner than the last updated date. By continuing to use the Services after the date the changes become effective, you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to any changes made to these Terms, you must immediately stop using the Services.
