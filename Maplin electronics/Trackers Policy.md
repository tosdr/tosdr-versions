By accessing the Site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors. However, if you do not want any information to be collected and used by tracking technologies, you can visit the third-party vendor or the [Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or [Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).

We would like to specifically draw your attention to the fact that we share certain personal information with third parties who help us to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. The information we share with those third parties includes some of the information that you share with us (such as, your contact details and information about the transaction), and some of the information from your online interactions (such as the IP address of your device). That information is used to determine whether a transaction could be fraudulent. The third party we currently use to help us detect and prevent fraudulent transactions is a company called Signifyd; they are responsible for their use of your personal information and will use it for the purposes set out in their privacy policy (https://www.signifyd.com/privacy/).

Finally, we'll also share your information to comply with the law, to enforce our Terms and Conditions and protect the rights, property and safety of the Maplin team, our customers and others.

**How long we hold onto your data for**

We'll only keep your information on file for as long as you are a customer. If you haven't logged onto our website for three years we will delete your information from our systems. If you no longer wish to be a customer, you can also contact our support team and request to delete all the information we have on you.

In some circumstances, like cases of anti-money laundering or fraud, we may keep data longer if we need to or the law says we have to.

**Marketing**

If you have opted in to our marketing messages you'll receive updates by email and text on product launches and promotions.

No longer want to receive updates from us? No problem, you can stop our marketing by signing into your account on our website and clicking 'Your Details' and 'No, don't sign me up'. Alternatively email our support team at [help@maplin.co.uk](mailto:help@maplin.co.uk) and we'll update your preferences.

Please bare in mind that Maplin has many inter-connecting services so it may take a few days for our systems to update. Also stopping marketing messages will not stop order related updates.

You have a right to:

   

* Access the personal data we hold about you
* Be informed about how your personal data is being used
* Update incorrect data we have on file
* Request to delete your information on file
* Stop all direct marketing communication
