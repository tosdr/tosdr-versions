====================

[Home](https://www.strivescan.com/) » Terms and Conditions

PLEASE READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS.  THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

Betadac Media, LLC, doing business as StriveScan, (“StriveScan”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) provides an online mobile and web-based lead gathering, scanning, and student data capture service for prospective college applicants to be used by colleges and students as part of the pre-college application process. StriveScan’s services are accessible at www.strivescan.com (the “Main Site”) and www.strivefair.com or app.strivescan.com/students (the “Registration Site”), the StriveScan mobile applications (the “StriveScan App”), and various online tools, content, and software associated with our service (collectively, the “Service”). The term “you” or “your” where appropriate, may refer to either Colleges or Students. If you are accessing the Service on behalf of a company, corporation or other entity, then “you,” “your,” “College,” “Administrator,” “User” and “Student,” refer to that entity.

7. **Acceptance of Terms of Use.** By accessing or using the Service, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms of use (“Terms of Use” or “Agreement”), whether or not you become a registered user of the Service.  These Terms of Use, which incorporate by reference our [Privacy Policy](https://www.strivescan.com/privacy-policy/), govern your use of the Service. Failure to use the Service in accordance with these Terms of Use may subject you to civil and criminal penalties.  Should you NOT accept these Terms of Use, you must neither access nor otherwise use the Service.
8. **Changes to Terms of Use.** StriveScan reserves the right to alter the Agreement at its sole discretion and with reasonable notice, except where a legal or administrative reason requires immediate amendment of these terms.  We will notify you of amended terms by posting them to our Service, by email, or any other means we deem appropriate.  Use of the Service after posting of amended terms will be governed by those amended terms.  These terms will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the amended terms.
9. **Residency and Age.** By accessing and using the Service, you represent, warrant, and affirm that you are at least 18 years of age, an emancipated minor, or have acquired a parent or guardian’s consent.  You hereby affirm that you are, at a minimum and without exception, 13 years old.  The Service is not intended to be accessed or utilized by children less than 13 years of age.  If your use of the Service is illegal or otherwise prohibited in the jurisdiction where you are located, you are prohibited from accessing and utilizing the Service.  If you are accessing the Service on behalf of a corporation or other entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.
10. **Overview of the Service.** As mentioned, the Service provides an online mobile and web-based lead gathering, scanning, and student data capture service for prospective college applicants to be used by colleges and students at local, regional, and national college fairs (each, an “Event”).  Each Student completes a student registration form and receives a barcode. Students will then be able to visit with each College and their Users at the Event, and if the Student is interested in or wants to learn more about a particular college, the User, using the StriveScan App, can scan the barcode.  All of the information input into the Student Registration Form will then be available to the College via the Service.
11. **Student Information and Registration.** As a Student, when you first arrive at an Event, you will be instructed to complete a registration form (the “Student Registration Form”) for the Service via a website. The registration form contains various questions regarding your background information, academic performance, and interests (collectively, “Student Information”). Upon submission of the Student Registration Form, each Student will receive a unique barcode.  This barcode will be used by the organizers and hosts of the Event, Colleges and their Users (as defined below) to collect the Student Information. You understand that once you provide your Student Information to a particular Event organizer/host or College, they are solely responsible for how they use or exploits that Student Information. Though StriveScan encourages Event organizers and Colleges to use responsible practices when gathering Student Information, StriveScan is not responsible nor may be held liable for any actions or omissions of such Event organizers or Colleges.
12. **College Registration.**
    1. **Account Sign Up.** Students may browse the Service and submit their Student Information at applicable Events without registering.  Although Colleges may also browse the Service without registering, Colleges, through a designated administrator (“Administrator”) authorized to bind College to this Agreement, will need to first register their institution with the Service in order to use the Service at Events, purchase Event Tokens, capture Student Information, and create and manage your Service account (your “Account”).  Administrator may register the College for the Service by following the instructions, including selecting a username and password (your “Login Credentials”), on the Account sign up page located on the Main Site.

    3. Authorized Users. Upon registering, Administrator may grant access to the Service to multiple College employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, or agents of the College (each, a “User”) by providing each User with the proper Login Credentials for the College’s Service Account.  Each User may access the Service either through the Main Site or through the StriveScan App.  Upon downloading the StriveScan App, Users must input their Login Credentials.  Once signed into the Service, Users may take advantage of all of the service offerings and features available on the Service.
    4. Protecting Login Credentials. Each College and its authorized Users are solely and fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Login Credentials, and you are solely and fully responsible for all activities occurring under your username and password.  You understand and agree that, except with respect to Administrator’s right to invite designated Users to access the Service, the Login Credentials are non-transferable and non-assignable.  To that end, you, as a User, agree to: 1) immediately notify StriveScan of any unauthorized use of your username and password or any other breach of security; and 2) ensure that you log off from your account at the end of each session.  StriveScan shall not be liable for any loss, damage or other liability arising from your failure to comply with this section or from any unauthorized access to or use of your account.
    5. College Responsibilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each College is solely responsible for all activity occurring under its User accounts and shall abide by all applicable local, state, national, and foreign, laws, treaties and regulations in connection with College’s use of the Service, including those related to data privacy, international communications, and the transmission of technical or personal data. Each College, via the Administrator or other appointed personnel, shall: (i) notify StriveScan immediately of any unauthorized use of any password or account or any other known or suspected breach of security; and (ii) not impersonate another StriveScan user or provide false identity information to gain access to or use the Service.
13. **StriveScan App.**
    1. Download the App. In order to use the Service via the StriveScan App, each User must download the StriveScan App. Upon downloading the StriveScan App, Users must input the Login Credentials provided to them by the College.  Users who have downloaded the StriveScan App and signed into the Service utilize many of the Service features available through the Site. In addition, Users may scan each Student’s barcode for purposes of gathering Student Information at Events.
14. **Standard Messaging and Data Rates Apply.** In order to use the Service as a Student, College, or User, you must have a cell phone and/or tablet.  Your use of the Service is subject to all standard messaging and data rates assessed by your mobile access provider. When registering, Students give permission for StriveScan and its agents and vendors to contact you via email, text message, or automatic or automated dialing technology at the telephone number or email address shown. Such contact includes informational and service emails and texts (such as an barcode delivery, reminders, and fair information).
15. **Photography and Recording.** Students, Users, and Colleges consent to be photographed, digitally recorded, video taped, audio taped, and/or interviewed and consent to the use of their photograph, likeness, or voice, by StriveScan, the organizers of the Events, and their agents. These photos and recordings may be shared with third parties or altered in any manner. You agree that these photographs and recordings are the sole property of StriveScan, free and clear of any claims by you or anyone acting on your behalf.
16. **Privacy Policy.** In addition to the terms contained herein, you agree to the privacy practices and procedures outlined in our privacy policy located at https://www.strivescan.com/privacy.  In the event of a conflict between these Terms and our Privacy Policy, the Privacy Policy shall control to the extent of such conflict.

    1. Fair Credits. In order to use the StriveScan App and Service at Events, Colleges, must purchase through the Main Site or the StriveScan App’s in-app purchase mechanism Event credits (each, a “Credit”).  The fees for Credit are set forth on the Main Site, and such fees may vary from time to time.  Each Credit (or group of Credits) may be redeemed for access to the Service at a particular Event. Credits are not refundable or non-transferable. Some Events may not require Credits because use of the Service has been paid for by the Event organizer.
18. **Payments**
    1. **Payment Processor.** StriveScan uses the third party payment processor, Stripe (the “Payment Processor”), to process all payments for the Service made through the Main Site.  Your use of that service is governed by Stripe’s terms of service, available [here](https://stripe.com/us/legal).  StriveScan is not responsible for the performance of the Payment Processor’s processing of your payment, the security of their site, or their use of any payment information provided by you.

The provision of refunds in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.

33. **Miscellaneous.**
    1. Choice of Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the United States of America and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to conflicts-of-laws principles that would require the application of any other law.
    2. Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief), arising out of the Terms or the Service, where the total amount of the award sought is less than $5,000, the Party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The ADR provider and the Parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the Party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the Parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. StriveScan shall reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $5,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to arbitration, except those claims that may be asserted in small claims court. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), and governed under AAA’s rules. ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR STRIVESCAN MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, StriveScan will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation. StriveScan reserves the right, in its sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration. The arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law. Judgment on an arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall be confidential and final and binding upon the Parties without appeal or review, except as permitted by Illinois law or United States federal law.The Parties agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in a court of competent jurisdiction located in Cook County, Illinois, and the Parties waive any right to a jury trial. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding the above, either Party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Subject to the arbitration provisions set forth herein, the successful Party in any dispute will be entitled to receive from the unsuccessful Party all reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements.
    3. Severability. If any provision – or portion of a provision – of this Agreement is held invalid, unenforceable, or void, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain unaffected and shall continue in full force and effect.
    4. Separability. This Agreement does not and shall not be construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties hereto.
    5. Merger. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties hereto, and replaces any and all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements between the parties, whether oral, electronic, or written, pertaining to the managerial relationship outlined herein.  The parties acknowledge that they have not relied on any promise, representation, or warranty, express or implied, not contained in this Agreement.  No waiver or any breach of this Agreement shall be construed as a continuing waiver or consent to any subsequent breach hereof.
