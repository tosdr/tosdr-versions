We care about your personal data, so in this document we have detailed what data we collect and how we use it, what information we do NOT collect, and how we work with third parties.

Our data protection principles are only concerned with collecting the minimum data necessary to operate a VPN service. Our applications are designed so that they do not require the sensitive data of our users.

This Privacy Policy is aimed to inform you (“you”) — a user of VeePN Corp. Service — how we, VeePN Corp. (“Application”, “App”, “Services”) with registered office at Samuel Lewis Ave & 55th Street, PH SL55 Building, 21st Floor, Panama, Republic of Panama, collect and use your information when you use our Services. We only use your information as described in this Privacy Policy, and we won't share it with anyone except as described here. This Privacy Policy is subject to our Services Terms of Service.

By choosing to use our Service you explicitly: (I) agree to the collection and use of information concerning this policy, (II) warrant and guarantee that you are over 18 years of age (or are a parent or guardian with such authority to agree to this Privacy Policy for the benefit of an individual under 18 years of age). Please do not use the Application or access the Services provided by it if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy.

What kind of information we collect
-----------------------------------

**Important Notice**

_We're a VPN service based in Panama City, which privacy-friendly jurisdiction that allows us to not store our VPN logs. **We never collect IP addresses and logs of your activity** (“usage logs”), which means we don't track or store your browsing history, network traffic, or other similar data. We work with tools such as Google Analytics. You can learn more about the Google Analytics Privacy Policy here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)._

_When you sign up for our VPN service, we receive your data so we can verify your account and help you restore it if needed. We may collect information that directly identifies you, such as your name and email address (which you specified when registering) (“Personal Information”), and other information that does not identify you as listed below._

### Information you provide

We may collect the contact information you provide, such as name and email address, when you register and use the Service or provide it to us in some other manner. For example when you correspond with us (by email or chat, for instance), when you report a problem with the Service, when you subscribe to any of our services, or agree to the mailing.

This information is collected to administer your VeePN subscription and includes your name, email address, and payment information, which you submit on our order page when you subscribe for the Services.

**Note**

_**Information about a third party.**_ When you provide us with information about a third party, you must have that third party's consent before doing so. By providing us with information regarding a third party you confirm that you have their permission to give that information to us.

If our application fails for any reason, we may also ask you to send us a **crash report** so that your problem can be resolved as quickly as possible.

### Information we collect on our website and apps

All of the information below helps us identify problems with our servers and our site. All information is used for marketing purposes and user analytics, and it’s not connected to the user's personal information.

When you approve the tracking of your data, in particular, we collect only the Wi-Fi name (Service Set Identifier), Wi-Fi status, OS version, device type, and model ("Technical Information").

You can reset your ID or opt out of personalized ads by changing your device settings.

When you use our applications, we can collect an advertising ID. It is a unique identifier for displaying relevant ads and other marketing offers.

* **Device information.** It can include specific information about your device (for example, OS version or hardware model), information about your use of features, etc. **These number values are not permanently tied to your device. Also, depending on your OS, you can reset it through your device settings.** Besides, to provide our antivirus service (available on Windows and Android as of now), we also collect information about the devices on which you use the antivirus. We need this info to make sure that the limit of the device slots that one client may use for the antivirus service is not exceeded (as provided in our Terms of Service). We may also process malware name and type, country, OS, and user ID to provide statistics on what malware was detected.
    
* **Email information.** If you use the Breach Alert feature as a part of the VeePN Security Bundle, you can provide your email address to monitor it for data leaks. If you decide to let us monitor your email, you also allow us to use additional information related to it (usernames, full names, passwords, country, IP address) that could be exposed in a breach. We use this information to detect when your email or the data associated with it is noticed in a security breach. If we identify a breach involving your data, we will promptly notify you via the email address you provided. We store this data encrypted and are unable to view or use it in any way outside of the main purpose of the relevant feature.
    
* **Usage information.** This includes your user account registration date and time, information about the use of the App (such as frequency of use, engagement with particular features, which sections of the App user visits, and your common use patterns). **Please note that wording 'usage' does not in any case mean that we collect your usage logs.**
    
* **Cookies.** A cookie is a small amount of data stored on your computer used as an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit our website veepn.com (“Website”), we may collect information from you automatically through cookies or similar technology.
    
    In particular, we use cookies to recognize you on our Website and remember your previously selected preferences. Please note that our use of cookies does not in any way relate to your use of our Services but only to your interaction with our Website itself.
    
    If you want to prevent cookies from being saved, you can select the “Accept no cookies” option in your browser settings. To find out exactly how this works, you can refer to your browser instructions. You can delete cookies that have already been saved on your device at any time. However, in a few cases, some of the Website features may not function as a result.
    

What do we collect this information for
---------------------------------------

* Providing you with the best user experience on our Service by operating, maintaining, and giving you access to all features of the Services;
* Managing your account and providing you with customer support. We may use your Personal Information to respond to your requests for technical support, Services information, or to any other communication you initiate (“Customer support purposes”);
* Analytics purposes and performing research of your interest in our products, services, content, or by-products, services, or content offered by others;
* Communicating with you via email, push notifications, and/or other digital methods about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;
* Detecting and resolving any fraud or other illegal or undesirable user behavior.

Besides, to maintain the quality of our VPN service, we need to use third-party resources, with their own conditions and policies.

We may reach out to you via email to offer you the best VeePN deal, but we also recommend that you get in touch with us through our online contact form. To efficiently address your needs, we may ask you to provide us with some information about yourself. Additionally, we will utilize the information you provide to notify you of any future offers that may be of interest to you.

In case you prefer not to receive emails from us, you can opt out or unsubscribe by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or clicking the "unsubscribe" button located at the bottom of any email communication. If you have multiple email addresses, please opt out of each address to be removed from our active database.

Your consent, your existing relationship with VeePN, or our legitimate interest in carrying out marketing activities serves as the legal basis for processing your personal data.

With whom do we share this information and how may we disclose it
-----------------------------------------------------------------

All third-party services we work with use the minimum amount of your data, which are specified in paragraph 1 for quality service of your needs. Here is the general list of our main long-term service providers:

| Third-party provider | Purpose | Country of residence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure Providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and DigitalOcean | Storing information, overseeing server and domain management, as well as hosting our servers and networking equipment | United States |
| Emailing service providers such as Sendgrid | Sending and managing emails | United States |
| Live chat and Support service providers, such as Zendesk and Tidio | Providing of user support, live chat and support bot technology | United States |
| Payment Providers such as PayPal, Paddle, BlueSnap, Apple, Google and similar | Processing of payments, in-app purchases and subscriptions | United States |
| DNS, CDN & Security service providers such as Cloudflare, Akamai Technologies, Amazon Route 53, OpenVPN, OpenSSL, Let's Encrypt | Aiming at enhancing security measures and contributing to the optimization of service performance, user data protection | United States |
| Marketing service providers, analytics and diagnosis such as AppsFlyer, Amplitude, Google Analytics, Clarity | Enhancing our marketing efforts, tracking the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing our app's performance fixing bugs, improving our product | United States |
| Legal advisers, attorneys, notaries, bailiffs | Enforcing and defending our rights and legal interests | Panama, United States, Cyprus |

Personal data may be disclosed for the purpose of asserting our legal rights, mounting a legal defense against claims or complaints, and potentially sharing such information when we deem it essential to investigate, prevent, or address unlawful activities, suspected fraud, and breaches of our Terms.

Your personal data might be shared in scenarios where we are involved in the sale, potential sale, or negotiation of our business, or in the context of a corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, asset sale, reorganization, or similar event. In such instances, We remain committed to upholding the confidentiality of your personal data.

### Information disclosure

Any request for user data must adhere to an official legal process that is recognized by the laws of the Republic of Panama, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty or letters rogatory. Each request is meticulously reviewed to ensure its compliance with our company's applicable laws, the laws of the requesting country, international standards, and our internal policies.

It is crucial to understand that the laws of the Republic of Panama do not impose an obligation on us to retain logs of users' online activities. Consequently, we do not log browsing histories, traffic data, or IP addresses utilized for internet access through our services. As a result, we are unable to establish a connection between shared IP addresses of VPN services and individual users, or otherwise identify individual users based on data that is not processed by us. Consequently, even if we were to receive a legally justified request, it might prove unfeasible for us to ascertain a specific person or provide any identifying information pertaining to that individual.

In cases where, following an appropriate legal process, we are mandated to comply with a request, we will provide the limited data we process as outlined in our Privacy Policy, to the extent that it aligns with the scope of the request.

For contact information regarding government authorities:  
**VEEPN, Corp**  
50th and 59th Str., Nuevo Reparto Paitilla, Duplex 8E, Panama  
**email:** [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

For now we did not receive any request from government agencies to provide any information related to the use of our services.

The changes will appear in the [Warrant Canary](https://veepn.com/warrant-canary/) if such requests come.

How you can access your information
-----------------------------------

### Requests

If you would like to update or correct any information that you have provided to us through your use of the Service, you may use the Service to do so. If you need help with the changing of data you think is inaccurate, please contact us via email at [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

* **Requests to erase your Personal Information.** If you reside in the European Union or California, you can request to erase your Personal Information via [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please note that it may affect the Services provided, and you will not be able to use their full scope. Please also note that the **erasing of your Personal Information does not mean the automatic cancellation of your subscription or refund of your payments**.
* **Request to receive the Personal Information related to you.** If you reside in the European Union or California, you can request to receive Personal Information related to you via [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). In case you make such a request, you will be required to provide us with an email address, to which we will be able to send your Personal Information. Please note that you’ll have to confirm and guarantee that the email address you provide to us to receive your Personal Information belongs to you and you are solely responsible for its correctness and validity; therefore, we are in any case not liable for any breach of your Personal Information due to sending it to that email address.
* **Objection to the processing of Personal Information concerning you.** If you reside in the European Union, you may object to the processing of Personal Information concerning you for direct marketing purposes by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The applicable Personal Information, if any, will no longer be processed for such purposes.

VeePN prioritizes user privacy worldwide by collecting minimal data and empowering users to control their personal information. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) requires us to outline those practices in a specific manner for users in the EU.

In line with the GDPR, we collect and process the data outlined in this Privacy Policy on one of the following bases, depending on the circumstances:

* For the purposes of fulfilling our contractual obligations to users, including:
    
    * Providing users with the Services and Apps they have requested
    * Managing user subscriptions and processing payments
    * Providing customer support
* For a legitimate interest associated with the operation of our business, including:
    
    * Enhancing the quality, reliability, and effectiveness of our Site, Services, and Apps
    * Communicating with customers to provide information and seek feedback related to our Services and Apps
* With the consent of users, that users can withdraw at any time.

You can exercise your rights under the GDPR to access, transfer, correct, delete, or object to the processing of your personal information by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### Opting out via your device

Please note that you may also opt-out from the collection of your data for marketing and advertising purposes not only via our Application but also on your entire device using your device settings.

How do we secure the information
--------------------------------

We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures (including physical, electronic, and procedural measures) to help safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure.

Namely, VeePN has no access to your database password or any data stored in your local database on your devices. If you are using VeePN data records or tasks synchronization and backup service, VeePN will have access to the encrypted binary file on our servers which contains your database. We need this access to provide you with a secure backup and restore of your local personal database in case you have lost or damaged your device. VeePN will have no access to the data stored in this database.

Please note that we do not store the monitored data regarding the potential exposure of your credentials when using the VeePN Breach Alert. However, you have the option to save this information on our platform for further monitoring purposes.

As it was previously mentioned, **VeePN does NOT collect either logs or any user activities** while using any of their VPN services. VeePN stores the encrypted information about the number of connected devices for each account, as the maximum permitted amount is limited. This information can be assessed in the VeePN account, where any user can delete their devices from their account.

While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of information will never occur, we make all reasonable efforts to prevent it. However, you should bear in mind that the submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure.

Links to other services
-----------------------

There might be several places on our Service where you may click on a link directing you away from our Service to access other applications or websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including Personal Information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

Consent and age restrictions
----------------------------

Our Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under 18 years old. If we become aware that we have inadvertently obtained personal information from a person under 18, we will promptly delete such information from our records and terminate such account, if applicable.

If you are a parent or legal guardian and have reason to believe that your child under the age of 18 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate measures to remove the information and protect your child's privacy.

Retention
---------

We will keep your information for as long as the Application is installed on your mobile device or as needed to provide you with our Service. If you remove the Application, we will remove your information and use copies of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Changes to this privacy policy
------------------------------

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. That is why we advise checking our Service occasionally to be informed of any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page. The usage of the Application by you after changes have been posted to the Privacy Policy will denote your acceptance of such changes.

How to contact us
-----------------

Please submit any questions, concerns, or comments you have about this Privacy Policy or any requests concerning your Personal Information via email at [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
