These Terms govern your use of VeePN, a service available via the link [https://veepn.com/](https://veepn.com/) (the “Site”) and the related application software distributed via application store(s) or otherwise (the “App”), collectively referred to as the “Service”.

1\. Acceptance
--------------

By accessing the Service, you are agreeing on behalf of yourself or those you represent (“you”) to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms in their entirety.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement ( the “Agreement” ) between you and VeePN Corp. (“VeePN”, “we”, “us”, “our”), with registered offices at Samuel Lewis Ave & 55th Street, PH SL55 Building, 21st Floor, Panama, Republic of Panama. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use our Services.

By creating an account for using our Services, you represent that you are at least eighteen (18 years of age (or are a parent or guardian with such authority to agree to this Privacy Policy for the benefit of an individual under 18 years of age) or that you are a valid legal entity, and that the registration information you have provided is accurate and complete.

2\. Modification
----------------

VeePN may update the Terms from time to time without notice. If you continue to use Service after these changes take effect, then you agree to the revised Terms. The current version of the Terms is available on the Site. You understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations. Notification on any core changes to the Terms will be provided to subscribers through an email message or update to the Site. Your use of the Service following the changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changed Terms.

3\. Privacy policy
------------------

Any and all issues regarding the provision of your personal information are governed by our [Privacy Policy](https://veepn.com/privacy-policy/) and you are giving your consent to the collection of such information by using the Service in accordance with its terms. Therefore, we recommend you to review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data.

4\. Payments
------------

VeePN offers a number of different Subscription Plans for the provision of the Service, on a monthly, yearly and a five-year basis (the Subscription Plan). The Subscription Plans are subject to change from time to time by VeePN, without liability to VeePN or any prior notice required. The VeePN app for any compatible platform or operating system can be downloaded free of charge while the usage of the Service is subscription-based.

You will have to purchase a paid subscription to connect to the VeePN Service in order to use the Service. Some of VeePN\`s paid features/subscriptions are subject to prior activation in order to be used. Please follow the instructions provided in such features/subscriptions\` descriptions to get full access and start using them.

You may be provided with a limited free trial or certain coupon offers prior to the subscription purchase. You can revoke from the subscription (i.e. cancel it) and, therefore, stop the usage of the Service while the free trial or coupon offer is due. The exact period of the free-trial (if available) can be found in the Service.

Should you not cancel the subscription and continue to use our Service after the trial period, or in case if the trial period is not provided, the subscription cannot be further revoked and your payment cannot be returned to you unless otherwise stipulated in these Terms.

Therefore, in order to avoid being charged should you willing not to, you must affirmatively cancel a subscription or a free trial in your app store account settings at least 48 hours before the end of the free trial or the current subscription period. If you are unsure how to cancel a subscription or a free trial, please visit the [apple support website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039), [google play help](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) (or any other app store's support pages), or contact us via [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). PLEASE BE AWARE THAT DELETING THE APP DOES NOT CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS DUE OR SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT FOLLOW FREE TRIALS.

The Subscription Plans may be found in the Service. Once you choose your Subscription Plan as above, and in consideration thereof, you shall be required to choose a method for payment from a number of third-parties payment processors which are external to our Site. All payments of monthly and yearly subscriptions made with credit card, Google Play Store or iTunes in-app purchases, PayPal are recurring (i.e., shall be automatically renewed at the end of the billing period of your Subscription Plan), at the same time a five-year subscription that is made with credit card, PayPal, Google Play Store or iTunes in-app purchases is a one time payment. All payments of five-year subscriptions made with Paymentwall are one-time payments, yearly and monthly subscriptions are recurring. All purchases that are made with crypto currency are one-time payments. Note that auto-renewal subscriptions become non-refundable after the auto-renewal. You shall be solely liable for any fees, commissions or rates of the third-party Payment Processors of your choosing.

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. VeePN is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction.

5\. Refund policy
-----------------

**We have a Money-Back Guarantee policy in the mentioned term:**

* For 1 month plans a 14-day Money Back Guarantee.
* For 6 months or greater subscriptions a 30-day Money Back Guarantee.

If you choose not to use our paid Services anymore, we guarantee you a right to claim a refund within 14 or 30 days since the date of the original purchase following your subscription to our Services. However, we would like to solve your issue before you decide to cancel the subscription, therefore you are always welcome to reach out to us at [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of VeePN, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact VeePN to resolve the issue. In this case, VeePN may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.

Refunds are generally processed within ten (10) working days. The payment providers tell us that it can take up to 14 days for that refund to appear back in your account. Refunds are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency.

Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or purchasing of additional licenses under the same account, shall constitute a waiver of the Money Back Guarantee option.

You can only get a refund for our Services once. If your subscription has been rebilled, or was canceled and later renewed, it is considered to be non-refundable. No refunds will be considered for accounts terminated for violation of these Terms.

All fees associated with discounted trials are strictly non-refundable. By signing up for a discounted trial, you explicitly acknowledge and agree that the fee for the trial is non-refundable under any circumstances. This means that even if you choose to cancel your subscription before the trial period ends, the fee you paid for the discounted trial will not be returned to you. Please note that general refund rules do not apply to discounted trial fees.

Our Support Team at [\[email protected\]](https://veepn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) will be happy to help you with the refund request. It's obligatory to contact the Support Team with the same email address that you used for registration, otherwise the refund procedure will not be started.

### Note that:

* Apple In-App Purchases refunds can be claimed from Apple ([https://expresslane.apple.com](https://expresslane.apple.com/)).
* Payments made with any form of cryptocurrency may be refunded only in the same cryptocurrency. The transaction fee will be deducted from the refund amount.
* In some specific cases, we will not be able to make a refund via the same payment system that the refunded purchase had been made. In those cases we will require additional information from our user, to define the acceptable payment system in order to make a full refund.
* This Agreement is personal to you, is your obligation, and therefore, you may not assign your rights or obligations of this to anyone.
