### **This Privacy Policy was last modified on February 14, 2024.**

Oxford Learning® ’s Privacy Policy has been updating in accordance with new regulations set forth by the GDPR and new EU legislation surrounding data collection and privacy information.

Oxford Learning Centres, Inc. operates the website www.oxfordlearning.com. This page informs you of how we collect and use any personal information we receive from visitors to our website.

By using this website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Your personal information is used in conjunction with third-party websites for contact and ongoing marketing purposes such as emails, call tracking, marketing analytics, and CRM. By using this website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, postal address, and phone number (“Personal Information”).

Our data forms will always disclose that information being entered is being collected for communication purposes. At any point in the data collection and communication process, users may unsubscribe or adjust their settings to disallow information collection.

#### Log Data

Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site (“Log Data”).

If you choose, you can opt out by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser. Instructions on how to disable cookies will vary according to what browser you are using.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our Site. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our Site or other sites on the Internet.

You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick Cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the [Google Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) page.

#### Google AdWords

This website uses the Google AdWords remarketing service within North America to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry.

We use “Google Analytics” to collect information about the use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.

You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

Google Analytics employs cookies to define user sessions, which allows for the collection of data about how visitors are using the websites. Google Analytics uses only first-party cookies for data analysis. This means that the cookies are linked to a specific website domain, and Google Analytics will only use that cookie data for statistical analysis related to your browsing behaviour on that specific website. According to Google, the data collected cannot be altered or retrieved by services from other domains.

We may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing materials such as postcards or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in any email we send.

We will disclose your Personal Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Site.

#### Business Transaction

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Information may be transferred. We will provide notice before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
