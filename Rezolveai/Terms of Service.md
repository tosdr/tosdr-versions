* If the Service (excluding any third party services used in conjunction with the Service) will not be operational and available to You at least 99.9% of the time in any calendar month, You will be eligible to receive the Service Credits as described below.
* This Down Time Compensation provision states Your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by ASC to provide the Service.
* Definitions: The following definitions shall apply to the Down Time Compensation provision. **‍**
* **“Downtime”** means, for Service(s), if there is more than a five percent user error rate. Downtime is measured based on ASC’s server-side error rate. **“Downtime”** does not include the period of a Cloud Migration in which some or all of the Customer Data may be unavailable for use. **‍**
* **“Downtime Period”** means, for a domain, a period of ten consecutive minutes of Downtime, excluding any Scheduled Downtime. Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than ten minutes will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods **‍**
* **“Monthly Uptime Percentage”** means total number of minutes in a calendar month minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in a calendar month, divided by the total number of minutes in a calendar month. **‍**
* **“Scheduled Downtime”**: ASC would do production installs and upgrades on weekends between 6 am UTC to 8am UTC or Monday 4am UTC to 6am UTC. ASC would try to keep the services up and running as much as possible during these installs too. Scheduled Downtime is not considered Downtime for purposes of this Down Time Compensation provision and will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods. **‍**
* **“Service Credit”** means the following:  
    Monthly Uptime Percentage : Calendar Days of free Service added to the end of the Subscription term   
    99.8% – ≥ 99.0% -> 1  
    99.0% – ≥ 90.0% -> 7  
    90.0% -> 30 **‍**
* **You Must Request Service Credit.** To receive any of the Service Credits described above, You must notify ASC within thirty (30) days from the time You become eligible to receive a Service Credit. Failure to comply with this requirement will forfeit You right to receive a Service Credit.

**12\. LIMITED LIABILITY**

* IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS SECTION ‎12‎ SHALL NOT APPLY TO YOUR BREACH OF THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION ‎3.
* NOTWITHSTANDING THE GENERALITY OF THE ABOVE, IF A PARTY IS FOUND TO BE LIABLE BY A FINAL JUDICIAL RULING, THE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY THEREUNDER FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE AND/OR THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WILL BE LIMITED TO, AND IN NO EVENT SHALL EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID OR DUE BY YOU TO US FOR THE PROVISION OF THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM. THIS SECTION ‎‎12 SHALL NOT APPLY TO: (A) A BREACH OF EITHER PARTY’S CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS; (B) YOUR BREACH OF THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION ‎3; OR (C) YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US.

**13\. INDEMNIFICATION**

* **Indemnification by Us.** We shall defend You from and against any claim, suit or proceeding based on a claim that the Service or its underlying software, when used as authorized hereunder, infringes any copyright, trademark, patent or other Intellectual Property Right (an “Infringement Claim”), and will indemnity You from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against You as a result of, or for amounts You pay under a settlement we approve in writing of, an Infringement Claim. In the event any Infringement Claim is made or, in ASC’s sole judgment, is likely to be made, We shall use reasonable commercial efforts, at ASC’s expense and discretion, to either: (i) procure for You the right to continue the use Service; (ii) replace the infringing software with non-infringing software programs and support materials of equivalent function and performance; (iii) modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing without detracting from function or performance; or (iv) terminate this Agreement upon written notice and refund the respective Fees paid by You, prorated to the remaining Subscription Term. This is Your sole and exclusive remedy for any Infringement Claim.
* **ASC’s** indemnification obligation will not apply: (a) if the Service is modified by You, without ASC’s consent; (b) if the Service is combined with other products, applications, or processes not authorized by Us, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; or (c) to any unauthorized use of the Service.
* **Indemnification by You.** You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Us harmless, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debts, and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) Your use, Users’ use, and unauthorized use of the Service; (ii) a third-party claim, suit or proceeding that the use of the Customer Data or Your artifacts within the scope of this Agreement infringes any Intellectual Property Rights of a third party; (iii) claim, suit or proceeding or penalty alleging that the distribution of the Customer Data or Your artifacts within the scope of this Agreement infringes any applicable export laws or regulations.
* **Indemnification Process.** In the event a claim is brought against a party hereto (the “Indemnifying Party”), the Party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”) shall promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with a written notice of the claim, provided that, a failure to provide such notification shall only excuse the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party to the extent it was materially prejudiced thereby. Neither Party, as the case may be, shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to any Claim without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the above, ASC may enter into a settlement without Your consent, to the extent the only obligation associated with You thereunder is of monetary nature.
* **Generative AI.** Certain features of the Service utilize generative AI tools, including without limitation Azure OpenAI, Google Cloud Platform, Anthropic, and IBM.

**16\. MISCELLANEOUS**

* **Compliance with Laws** : Each Party shall be responsible to comply, at its own expense, with local, state, national and international laws and regulations, including without limitation laws regarding data protection, security and privacy and with all governmental approvals, licenses, permits and authorizations which may be required with regards to its rights and obligations hereunder.
* **Governing Law and Jurisdiction** : With respect to Customers domiciled in North America, South America, or Australia, this Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws thereof and without regard to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The competent state or federal courts located in Alameda County, California shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes between the Parties, and the Parties further agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for litigating any such claim or action.  
    You hereby agree to service of process in accordance with the rules of such courts. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. **‍**

* **No Waiver**. The failure of either Party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the other Party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that Party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches. **‍**
* **Injunctive Relief**. Since a breach by a Party of any of its confidentiality obligations contained herein or any unlawful action made in connection with a Party’s Intellectual Property Rights, may result in irreparable and continuing damage to the other Party, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, the breaching Party acknowledges and agrees that money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for any such breach or actions, and therefore the damaged Party will be entitled, in addition to money damages, to seek specific performance and injunctive relief and any other appropriate equitable remedies in connection therewith.  Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for such events but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. **‍**

You agree that this Agreement is a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties and supersedes any proposals or prior agreement, oral or written, and any other communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Either Party may assign this Agreement to (A) any Affiliate, or (B) a successor in a merger, acquisition or other consolidation including, without limitation, the sale of all or substantially all of its stock or assets, or business to which this Agreement applies. The Party assigning this Agreement shall provide the other Party with a notice to that effect as soon as practical.  **‍**
* **Changes to this Agreement**. This Agreement including any referenced policies and other documents, may be amended, updated or changed by Us, from time to time. Unless expressly stated otherwise, any modification shall become effective upon the renewal of the respective Subscription. For the avoidance of doubt, and unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, any Subscription is subject to the version of the Agreement in effect at the time of Your Registration or the applicable Order Form. Any terms included in any purchase order, payment portal or otherwise shall not apply to Your use of the Service unless signed by a duly authorized representative of ASC.
