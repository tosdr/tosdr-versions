SECTION 3 - ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS AND TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------------

We are not responsible if information made available on this site is not accurate, complete or current. The material on this site is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon or used as the sole basis for making decisions without consulting primary, more accurate, more complete or more timely sources of information. Any reliance on the material on this site is at your own risk. Products offered for sale may contain descriptions including but not limited to Product format (hardcover, paperback, etc.), publisher summaries, page counts, word counts, suggested reading ages and suggested reading levels. These descriptions may have been provided by third parties, including but not limited to publishers, manufacturers, or distributors. When you purchase a Product from us, you agree to having read the relevant description provided on the Site. We do not, however, represent or warrant such descriptions are accurate or complete.

This site may contain certain historical information. Historical information, necessarily, is not current and is provided for your reference only. We reserve the right to modify the contents of this site at any time, but we have no obligation to update any information on our site. You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor changes to our site.

SECTION 4 - ACCOUNTS
--------------------

In order to use certain features of the Site or the Service, you must register for an account with us (“Account”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the Site registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; and (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.

SECTION 5 - PAYMENT TERMS
-------------------------

For each Subscription or Product you order on the Site, you agree to pay the applicable price as of the time you submitted your order (“Product Price”), the delivery fees for the delivery Service you select (“Delivery Fees”), and any applicable Taxes (defined below). If you order a subscription to a Product (with a monthly term, or a term of 3 months, 6 months or 12 months) that auto-renews (“Subscription”), then you agree to pay the applicable Product Price, Delivery Fees, and Taxes upon each auto-renewal date, until you terminate your Subscription in accordance with the directions on the Site. Your next billing date will be displayed in your Account page for each of your active Subscriptions (“Renews on” date). We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, if there are unforeseen delays that hinder our ability to ship your product or if there are changes to your Account or Subscriptions. Please also note that if your Subscription includes a discounted Product Price for a promotional period, once the promotional period expires, your Subscription will renew at the full Product Price. As such, if you purchase a Subscription, until such time as you terminate your Subscription in accordance with the directions on this site, you hereby authorize, agree and assent to the Company’s automatically billing your credit card submitted as part of the order process for such amounts that are due. You will be solely responsible for payment of all taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s income), fees, duties, and other governmental charges, and any related penalties and interest, arising from the Product purchase (“Taxes”) not withheld by Company. All payments are non-refundable (except as expressly set forth in this document). Without limiting other remedies, we reserve the right to charge a late fee on all past due payments equivalent to the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance or the highest rate allowed by law. You agree to pay for all collection costs, attorneys’ fees, and court costs incurred in the collection of past due amounts.

SECTION 6 - SHIPPING POLICY
---------------------------

Products will be shipped via the shipping option you select at the time of purchase or by the shipping option selected by us, including but not limited to USPS Media Mail within the United States (continental, Alaska, Hawaii as well as overseas military addresses including APO, DPO, etc.). We reserve the right to make deliveries in installments.

The cost to ship Products that you purchase through the Site is calculated on a “per order,” “per item,” or “per pound” basis and is based on the shipping option selected by you or us at the time of purchase. We will ship, working by ourselves or through third-party fulfillment centers, the Products to the address designated by you so long as such address is complete and complies with the shipping restrictions contained on the Site. All transactions are made pursuant to a shipping contract and, as a result, risk of loss and title for the Product passes to you upon delivery of the Product to the carrier. Lost Product or Product returned as undeliverable will be replaced or reshipped to you only after you pay relevant replacement or shipping fees.

We will send you an email when your order has shipped and you may review your order and shipping information on your Account. Any delivery dates provided by us are estimates. Currently, we ship to the US only. You are responsible for keeping your account and shipping information accurate and up-to-date and any address changes for a month’s Subscription box must be made by the 15th of the month by 11:59pm PST to be valid for that month’s box.

When gifting a product through our site, you may have the option to include a personalized gift message for the recipient. If you provide the recipient's email address during the checkout process, the gift message will be delivered via email. In cases where an email address is not provided but a physical mailing address is provided, the gift message will be sent in the form of a postcard to the recipient's mailing address.

If we guarantee delivery of Product by a certain date, we may provide a refund of any Delivery Fees associated with delivery of that Product if Product does not arrive by the guaranteed delivery date, subject to the following terms and requirements: (1) The ordered Product is covered by the delivery date guarantee; (2) the ordered Product is shipping to an eligible address; (3) the Product order is placed before any deadline associated with the guaranteed delivery date; and (4) the customer's credit card or debit card must also be successfully charged before the deadline associated with the guaranteed delivery date.

Our delivery guarantee shall be considered fulfilled under each of the following circumstances: (1) when the Product is successfully delivered on or before the guaranteed delivery date; (2) when an attempted delivery on or before the guaranteed delivery date is made; or (3) when an offer by the carrier of a delivery appointment on or before the guaranteed delivery date is made. The guarantee does not apply if we miss our promised delivery date because of an unforeseen circumstance outside of our control, such as a strike, pandemic, civil unrest, natural disaster, or severe winter storm. To inquire about a refund of the Delivery Fees associated with a Product order, contact us at support@bookroo.com.

SECTION 7 - CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY
------------------------------------------

Auto-renewing Subscriptions: Except for one-time gifts, Subscriptions auto-renew on the 15th of the applicable month (for example, month-to-month Subscriptions renew on the 15th of each month, three month Subscriptions renew on the 15th of every third month, etc.). You can cancel the auto-renewal of your Subscription at any time. To cancel the auto-renewal on your Subscription so that it does not renew on the next renewal date, email us at support@bookroo.com with the order number, name and/or email address of the applicable account.

Unless you indicate otherwise, we will continue to send any unsent boxes left on your account for which you have already paid. If you want to cancel any remaining shipments and receive a pro rata refund, please indicate this by email. Multi-month Subscriptions may be cancelled and a refund requested mid-term, and a pro-rated refund (excluding promotional discounts and discounts for multi-month subscriptions) will be issued for any remaining months.

Cancel the auto-renewal of your Subscription by 11:59 PM PST on the 15th of the renewal month if you do not wish to be charged again and receive future boxes. If you email to cancel after 11:59 PM PST on the 15th of the renewal month, you are ineligible for a refund for that month’s box and will receive that month’s box.

Gift subscriptions: One-time gift Subscriptions (1-, 3-, 6-, 12-month terms) are not eligible for cancellation. These Subscriptions will expire after the original term is complete.

SECTION 8 - RETURN POLICY
-------------------------

1. Return Policy. Except as otherwise stated herein, if you are not satisfied with your Product purchase from us, we may return to your original form of payment a refund of the Product Price plus any applicable taxes so long as you notify us and return such Product within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such Product. All Product must be returned in its original condition. Except as otherwise stated herein, shipping fees will not be refunded, and you will be required to arrange for and cover the costs of shipping returned Product. Packing slips that may be contained in a Product shipment may have instructions for returns, but such slips are not prepaid shipping labels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscription box Products are not eligible for return except for first box refunds as described in SECTION 9.
2. Exchanges. Bookroo does not accept any Product exchanges.
3. Damaged Products. If the Product arrives damaged or not substantially as described on the Product information page (“Damaged Product”), Bookroo will send replacement Product if photo documentation is provided to support@bookroo.com of the damaged Product within 48 hours of the Product’s delivery (as determined by USPS tracking data). You’re eligible for a full refund of the Product Price and original shipping costs if you received the incorrect book or if it arrives damaged. To receive a refund, you must return your item in the same condition in which you received it. For books returned as ‘Not as described,’ return shipping amounts are refunded at our discretion.

SECTION 9 - REFUNDS
-------------------

If you are dissatisfied with your first Subscription box Product for any reason, Bookroo will refund the amount paid for your first month’s box (less any shipping and handling costs/fees related to the original purchase, which are non-refundable). Refund requests must be made directly to Bookroo at support@bookroo.com. All refund requests must be made within thirty (30) days of the first date of shipment of your first Subscription box Product. Upon receipt of your request, Bookroo will provide instructions for returning the Product. If for any reason you do not receive a response within three (3) business days, resubmit your request. Bookroo is not liable for Products that are damaged or lost in transit to Bookroo. Promptly (typically within five (5) business days) following Bookroo’s receipt of the returned Product, Bookroo will credit the amount paid for the returned Subscription box Product (less any shipping and handling costs/fees related to the original purchase, which are non-refundable) to the Payment Method you used to make the original purchase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bookroo does not control when a specific credit card or payment method company processes a chargeback transaction. You are responsible for contacting your credit card or payment method company if you have questions about the status of the refund.

Bookroo will not provide a refund for a request that is received by Bookroo more than thirty (30) days after the first date of shipment of your first Subscription box Product. Bookroo also does not provide a refund for returned Products that are damaged due to misuse, lack of care, mishandling, accident, abuse or other abnormal use.

We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.

SECTION 16 - USER ACCOUNTS, USER COMMENTS, FEEDBACK AND OTHER SUBMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some areas of the Service may allow Site users (“Users”) to upload, publish, display, link to or otherwise make available reviews, comments, questions, highlights, insights, trivia, quotes, worksheets, and other information ("User Content"). You are solely responsible for your User Content. You agree not to post User Content that is illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of content.

Bookroo reserves the right to, but has no obligation to, monitor, reject and/or remove any User Content at any time. For example, Bookroo may, but is not obligated to, reject and/or remove any User Content that Bookroo believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.

You hereby represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights with respect to, or that you have the legal right to post and will comply with applicable laws in posting (including properly crediting and attributing content, when applicable), your User Content; if the owner, you retain all intellectual property rights in and to any User Content you post, upload or otherwise make available through the Service. In all cases, you hereby represent that you have the power to grant the license granted below.

Bookroo takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other Users or third parties post or send over the Service. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content that you post is solely your responsibility. Bookroo is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User Content. You understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree that Bookroo shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of such User Content. Bookroo may provide tools for you to remove some User Content, but does not guarantee that all User Content will be removable.

Except as limited below, by posting any User Content to the Service, you expressly grant to Bookroo a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, reproduce, adapt, publish, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of the User Content.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have verified in our Service as an author or illustrator of a book and post any User Content to the Service for your own book that is an image (“Creator User Content”), you expressly grant to Bookroo a non-exclusive, limited, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, reproduce, adapt, publish, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of the Creator User Content. This license granted by you continues for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Creator User Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that Bookroo may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of the Creator User Content that have been removed or deleted.

If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user). You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users. You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent. We may cancel without notice unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a substantial period of time.

We may make available to Users unofficial, voluntary positions. We are not responsible for actions taken by volunteers, and we reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to hold a voluntary position at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these Terms. Volunteers are not Bookroo employees or representatives of Bookroo. Volunteers may not perform actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third parties, and we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a volunteer.

SECTION 17 - OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
-----------------------------------

Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content (the "Bookroo Content"), and all intellectual property rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of Bookroo and its licensors. Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such intellectual property rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any materials or content accessible on the Service. Use of the Bookroo Content or materials on the Service for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.

You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products ("Ideas"). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous and without restriction and will not place Bookroo under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Bookroo does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Bookroo, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.

Bookroo grants Users a personal, limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and use the Site for your personal, non-commercial, entertainment and educational purposes, subject to these Terms of Service. Unless otherwise provided herein, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate operation of the Site or Service at any time and to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Site, including, but not limited to, content and functionality, hours of availability, and equipment needed for access or use. In certain areas of the Site we provide tools that allow Users to create and modify digital elements. Subject to the limited license granted to Users herein and the other provisions of these Terms of Service, you may save elements and share screenshots and images of your elements with third parties so long as those uses are not commercial. The Site and any resulting elements that you create using it are the property of Bookroo. You acknowledge and agree that in addition to other actions, Bookroo may feature your elements on the Site, share your elements with third parties and otherwise use your spaces for any purpose without compensation to you.

Bookroo may suspend or terminate your Account at any time for any reason with or without notice. In such event, Bookroo shall have no further obligation or liability to you under these Terms of Service or otherwise, and you shall be entitled to no compensation or other payment, remedy, recourse or refund. You understand and agree that any elements, data, account history and account content residing on our servers may be deleted at any time for any reason in our sole discretion, with or without notice and with no liability of any kind. We do not provide and expressly disclaim any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any elements Users create or data residing on our servers.

Upon termination of your Account, you will no longer be able to access your Account or access (or transfer or direct the transfer to any other Account) any User Content or data you have stored on our servers. All licenses granted by Bookroo to use the Service will automatically terminate.

You should ensure that you have only stored User Content on the Site to which you are willing to permanently lose access. You acknowledge and assume the risk of the possibility of termination of your Account as provided in this Agreement, and you represent that you will make your decisions to participate in the Service and contribute User Content at all times knowingly based upon these risks.

SECTION 18 - PERSONAL INFORMATION
---------------------------------

Your submission of personal information through the Site, including information shared with third-party fulfillment centers or other third parties, is governed by our Privacy Policy. For more details, please review our Privacy Policy.

SECTION 19 - BOOKROO REGISTRIES AND BOOK FAIRS
----------------------------------------------

On our platform, we make available the option for certain users to create registries that display Products they would like to own (each a “Registry”) and create and host book fairs (each a “Book Fair”). By creating a Registry or Book Fair, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Section 19 in addition to the additional Terms of Service. Registries and Book Fairs are limited to users in the United States.

We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms or any policy, FAQ, or guideline pertaining to Registries and Book Fairs, in whole or in part, at any time and in our sole discretion without prior notice to users. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to https://bookroo.com/terms-of-service, and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications, except as may be required by law. Your continued access to your Registry, your Book Wallet, or any Book Fair related service following any such changes or modifications confirms your acceptance of these Terms and such changes or modifications; therefore, you should frequently review these Terms and the FAQs and any additional guidelines pertaining to Registries and Book Fairs so that you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your access to, and participation in, either service. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must stop accessing and using the service.

Book Registries
---------------

Users can use our platform to create Registries on which they can display books they would like to own. Registries can be shared with others, who can then purchase books from the registry, or purchase other books for the user.

It is the responsibility of a user to edit and monitor the information on their Registry, including the name or any indentifying information. By creating a Registry on our platform and adding your mailing address, you acknowledge that we have the right to ship you items associated with the Registry. You are responsible for ensuring any shipping information added to your account is accurate.

Notwithstanding anything else in these terms and conditions, no refunds are available for books purchased for or from Registries.

Book Catalogs
-------------

We may make available catalogs displaying various books from which users can select to add books to their Registry. We may also allow users to edit or customize such catalogs, including for use during a Book Fair. We are not responsible for book selections in catalogs and make no warranties, guarantees, or representations regarding the suitability, age appropriateness, or any other consideration relevant to the books featured in catalogs or on our platform.

Book Wallets
------------

As part of the Registry or Book Fair set up, we create an online book wallet account (“Book Wallet”) for users. Funds can become available in a Book Wallet when a book is purchased from your Registry but is unavailable to be fulfilled, when a user cancels a backordered book, or when someone sponsors a book as part of a Book Fair. Book Wallet funds may be redeemed by users only for purchases on our Site. Book Wallet funds are specific to a user and cannot be shared or transferred. Book Wallet funds are non-refundable and non-transferable and may not be redeemed for cash, unless otherwise required by law. All funds in the Book Wallet are reflected in United States Dollars (USD), and every dollar contributed to a Book Wallet reflects the equivalent USD within the Book Wallet. You must be a legal resident of the United States and at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your state to contribute to or redeem credit from a Book Wallet. Users are responsible for all Book Wallet activity and for ensuring that no unauthorized person has access to their Book Wallet. We do not warrant that access to a Book Wallet will be uninterrupted or error free, and we are not liable for loss of any funds pertaining to a user’s Book Wallet.

Damaged or Lost Books
---------------------

Please inspect your order upon receipt and contact us immediately if an item is damaged or if you received the wrong item. Notwithstanding Section 8, items ordered from a Registry or through a Book Fair are not returnable except in the case of damaged Product. If any items arrive damaged, please provide photo documentation of the damage to support@bookroo.com within 48 hours of the Product’s delivery (as determined by USPS tracking data), and we will provide instructions for returning damaged Product. The title and risk of loss for all products purchased by you and shipped by us or on our behalf by a third-party pass to you upon delivery to a carrier for shipment, and we are not liable for shipments that are lost after being delivered to a carrier, or for late deliveries or any damage that has occurred in the delivery process. At our discretion, we will refund or replace any missing products or products that arrived damaged. If you are not satisfied with your order for any reason, please contact us immediately.

Order Fulfillment and Shipping
------------------------------

Users can select when to release books available for shipment from their Registry. Books may be shipped in multiple packages. If the order quantity or amount qualifies for free shipping according to the terms posted on our site, the shipment will ship for free. Otherwise, the user agrees to pay for shipping.

We will determine in our sole discretion when to release books for shipment that are purchased as part of a Book Fair. Books may be shipped in multiple shipments. Book Fair users may select whether to have books shipped to a single shipping address listed for the fair or directly to fair participants at the address provided in their fair registries, provided that any books that cannot be shipped to participants because an address is invalid or has not been provided will be shipped to the fair’s shipping address 30 days after the Book Fair concludes. If the order quantity or amount qualifies for free shipping according to the terms posted on our site applicable to the relevant Book Fair, the shipments will ship for free. Otherwise, shipping costs will be deducted from the user’s share of Book Fair profits or charged to individual participants. If Book Fair profits are not sufficient to cover shipping, the user agrees to pay for shipping. By creating a Book Fair on our platform and adding your mailing address, you acknowledge that we have the right to ship you items associated with the Book Fair.

Books that have been ordered from a Registry or as part of a Book Fair that are not currently in stock will be placed on backorder and will ship when they are in stock and available. An additional shipping charge may be required for backorders. You can cancel a backorder by notifying us.

If a backorder is canceled, the corresponding book value, not including shipping, will be added to the user’s Registry. We reserve the right to credit any book purchased from or for a Registry to the relevant user’s Book Wallet instead of fulfilling the book. Shipping charges on canceled books are not contributed to a Book Wallet.

Profit Sharing & Taxes
----------------------

Users who create and host a Book Fair may be entitled to receive a portion of the profits generated by such Book Fair, pursuant to the terms posted on our Site pertaining to the relevant Book Fair. These funds will generally be transferred to the user by check, though we reserve the right to use other forms of transfer. Each user is responsible to ensure that the information provided by such user to receive payment, including information for completing a check, is accurate. In completing information to receive funds, a user also certifies that they are authorized to receive funds from the Book Fair. We are not liable for any lost checks or the loss of funds related to the Book Fair. Users agree to provide any necessary documents or forms required in connection with receiving such funds, including tax documents such as a Form W-9.

You acknowlege that we will not withhold or make any required payments in connection with funds and you are responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with, or made to, any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to any funds received from a Book Fair.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless a Book Fair user notifies us that the user is a tax-exempt entity, we will collect and submit sales tax on Book Fair sales in jurisdictions where we are required to collect sales tax.

Book Fair Data
--------------

Users who create a Registry or Book Fair agree to our use of anonymized Registry or Book Fair data to improve and promote our Registries and Book Fairs.

SECTION 20 - ERRORS, INACCURACIES AND OMISSIONS
-----------------------------------------------

Occasionally there may be information on our site or in the Service that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to, among other things, product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, product shipping charges, transit times and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update information or cancel orders if any information in the Service or on any related website is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order).

We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Service or on any related website, including without limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No specified update or refresh date applied in the Service or on any related website, should be taken to indicate that all information in the Service or on any related website has been modified or updated.

SECTION 21 - ACCESSIBILITY POLICY
---------------------------------

We are committed to providing access to all individuals, with or without disabilities, seeking information on our site.

We strive to make our website as accessible and usable as possible. We do this by following Section 508 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, the web's governing body).

Section 508 is a legal requirement and WCAG is a set of checkpoints and guidelines that help ensure that websites are designed and written properly. For example:

* Images have alternative text (so if you can't see the image you can still read the text).
* Color contrast between the foreground and background is sufficiently strong.
* Headings are correctly used (they're not just ordinary text made to look big and bold).
* Links make sense by themselves (e.g. no links that just say "Click here" or "More...").
* Tables are used for laying out tabular information and have proper headings and summaries.

We are committed to providing access to all individuals—with or without disabilities. If you have a problem using our site, please contact us and provide the URL (web address) of the material you tried to access, the problem you experienced, and your contact information. We'll attempt to provide the information you're seeking.

We reserve the right to terminate your use of the Service or any related website for violating any of the prohibited uses.
