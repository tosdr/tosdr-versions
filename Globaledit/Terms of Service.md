**6.4 Data Preservation in the Event of Suspension or Termination**

**6.4.1 Termination or Suspension by globaledit for Convenience or Late Payment; Termination by Customer**. If globaledit terminates this Agreement for any reason other than a Severe Infraction, or if Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.2.1, then for the first thirty (30) days during such suspension or following the effective date of such termination, as applicable, and only upon receipt by globaledit of all Fees due and payable by Customer (including the fees described in (d) below):

(a) globaledit will not take any action to intentionally erase or delete any Customer Content then stored on the SaaS Service under the Company Account;

(b) all applicable data or file storage charges provided will continue to accrue;

(c) globaledit will make provision for up to two (2) of Customer’s employees designated by Customer to globaledit in writing, to have such limited access to the SaaS Service as globaledit may determine, for the sole purpose of downloading that Customer Content;

(d) In the event of termination in accordance with this Section 6.4.1, globaledit may require that Customer pay all or a portion of the fees and charges that globaledit estimates will be applicable to any Customer Content retrieval in advance of allowing such retrieval to occur. globaledit reserves the right to modify its estimate of applicable retrieval and other fees and charges and require Customer to provide additional pre-payment amounts. If any applicable fees, as adjusted in accordance with this Section 6.4.1(d), are not paid in advance, then Customer shall pay all amounts due to globaledit immediately upon receipt of an invoice for such fees and other charges. If the pre-payment of the estimated retrieval and other fees and charges is greater than the actual amount of fees and charges, globaledit will refund any such excess, provided that the excess amount may at its discretion be applied to any amounts owed by Customer to globaledit under this Agreement. Alternatively, globaledit may offer to provide Customer with such Customer Content in such format and on such media as Customer and globaledit may mutually agree upon in writing and charged at globaledit’s then current rates for such services.

(e) In the event of termination in accordance with this Section 6.4.1, globaledit will have no obligation to: (i) continue to store any Customer Content under or in connection with the Company Account or otherwise after thirty (30) days from the suspension or early termination described in this paragraph; or (ii) provide Customer with access to the Customer Content described in this paragraph if Customer has not paid all Fees and other charges described in this paragraph in full.

**6.4.2 Termination or Suspension by globaledit for Cause.** If globaledit terminates this Agreement due to a Severe Infraction, or if globaledit suspends the Company Account due to a Severe Infraction without terminating the Agreement, as applicable, globaledit ’s obligations under this Agreement  cease and globaledit may at any time from and after the effective date of such termination erase or delete any Customer Content then stored by globaledit under or in connection with the Company Account or otherwise, whether by removing pointers to such files or data on any of our servers, overwriting or otherwise.

**6.5 Copies and archives**. Customer acknowledges that globaledit shall be entitled (but not obligated) to retain archives and a copy of any and all Customer Content and other materials or data which Customer or any Authorized User may upload to the system. Archived data will only be used in furtherance of system maintenance, restoration, or to facilitate the provision of Services.
