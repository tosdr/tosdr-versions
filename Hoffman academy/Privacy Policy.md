Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy discloses how we collect, use, and store the information we obtain from users of HoffmanAcademy.com

We are committed to protecting your privacy and the security of your Personally Identifiable Information (PII). PII is information that can be used to identify you personally online. Examples of PII are your full name and your email address.

We collect information that is necessary in creating an account and using our services, and you can modify that information in our database at anytime. See our [Terms of Service](https://app.hoffmanacademy.com/terms-of-service/) for instructions if you would like to have your PII removed from our database.

We never sell your information to third parties or use third party services to show you ads on our website.

Account Information
-------------------

When you create a Hoffman Academy account, we collect your first name and your email address.

We use this information in two ways:

To set up your Hoffman Academy account:  
Your Hoffman Academy account creation requires personal information. The information is used to uniquely identify you at log in so you can access your lesson progress and purchases.

To send you emails:  
Hoffman Academy uses MailChimp, a third party email service. Your information is collected and used for the purpose of enabling Hoffman Academy to improve your Hoffman Academy experience by sending our monthly email newsletter and sales notifications to you. MailChimp does not share your information with any other entities, nor does it use the information to contact you in any way. See MailChimp’s privacy policy here.

If you decide you no longer want to receive emails from Hoffman Academy, you can have them stopped at any time. See our [Terms of Service](https://app.hoffmanacademy.com/terms-of-service/) for instructions on how to be removed from our mailing lists.

All information you enter on our website is safely encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Only our administrators have access to the PII we collect.
