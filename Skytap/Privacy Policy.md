Privacy Policy
==============

Effective October 1, 2018 | Last Update June 28, 2024

### Introduction

Skytap considers your privacy paramount, and we take great care in keeping private and secure the personally identifying information that we gather related to users of our Website and/or Services and other third parties related to our business. This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the information that we collect or process related to when You use our Services, Website and/or other products, as well as how we use, disclose, protect, and share Your information, and where required by applicable law, the information we gather about individuals in the ordinary course of conducting our business. Except where indicated otherwise, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services that are not under Skytap’s control; those parties’ services are governed by their own privacy policies.

Certain jurisdictions worldwide have enacted laws related generally to processing the personal information about individuals.

* If you are located in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation effective 25 May 2018 (“GDPR”) applies to information about you while you were in the European Union (“Personal Data” under GDPR) that Skytap may collect. (NOTE: as the definition below states, “GDPR” as used in this Privacy Policy also will refer to the UK General Data Protection Regulation if you are located in the United Kingdom because, for purposes of this Privacy Policy and in general, these two forms of distinct and potentially applicable Data Protection Legislation are materially the same.) In that case, and under GDPR, you are defined as a “Data Subject,” Skytap is a “Data Controller” for Personal Data that Skytap obtains and “Processes,” and this policy explains your rights with respect to that Personal Data. (For clarity, Skytap’s primary Services offering provides a virtualized server environment for Skytap customers to process and control data within their own virtualized server workloads. This customer data may or may not be Personal Data. If the customer data the customers process includes Personal Data, then in that situation, between Skytap and the customer, Skytap is a Data Processor, and the customer is the Data Controller. However, in this circumstance, Skytap’s role is passive, and it does not collect or meaningfully use the customer’s data.)
    
* If you reside in California, The California Consumer Privacy Act, codified at Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et seq., as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), including any other future amendments as well as any final implementing regulations adopted either by the State of California Privacy Protection Agency (collectively, “CCPA/CPRA”) also now protects “Personal Information” that identifies, relates to, describes or can be associated with, or reasonably can be linked (directly or indirectly) with a specific individual (“Consumers”) or household in California.
    

### Definitions

**For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:**

**Account** means a unique account created for you to access our Services or parts of our Services.

**Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party, where “control” means ownership of 50% or more of the shares, equity interest or other securities entitled to vote for election of directors or other managing authority.

**Business**, for the purpose of CCPA/CPRA, refers to Skytap as the legal entity that collects Consumers’ personal information and determines the purposes and means of the processing of Consumers’ personal information, or on behalf of which such information is collected and that alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of consumers’ personal information, that does business in the State of California.

**CCPA/CPRA** refers to California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”).

**Consumer**, for the purpose of the CCPA/CPRA, means a natural person who is a California resident. A resident, as defined in the law, includes (1) every individual who is in the USA for other than a temporary or transitory purpose, and (2) every individual who is domiciled in the USA who is outside the USA for a temporary or transitory purpose.

**Cookies** are small files that are placed on your computer, mobile device or any other device by a website, containing the details of your browsing history on that website among its many uses.

**Data Controller**, for the purposes of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), refers to Skytap as the legal person which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data.

**Device** means any device that can access the Website and/or Services such as a computer, a cellphone or a digital tablet.

**Do Not Track** (DNT) is a concept that has been promoted by US regulatory authorities, in particular the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.

**GDPR** refers generally to both of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the variant adopted by the United Kingdom post-“Brexit”.

**Personal Data** is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g., a Data Subject or a Consumer depending on the applicable regulation).

For the purposes of GDPR, Personal Data means any information relating to you such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

For the purposes of the CCPA/CPRA, Personal Data means any information that identifies, relates to, describes or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a “Consumer”. Also, for clarity, CCPA/CPRA refers to Personal Data as “Personal Information.”

**Services** refers to the virtualized Infrastructure as a Service that Skytap makes generally available for subscription to companies via “[cloud.skytap.com](http://cloud.skytap.com/)”, and that is augmented and supported by “[help.skytap.com](http://help.skytap.com/)”, and “[learn.skytap.com](http://learn.skytap.com/)”.

**Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of Skytap. It refers to third-party companies or individuals employed by Skytap to facilitate the Website and/or Services, to provide the Services on behalf of Skytap, to perform services related to the Website and/or Services or to assist Skytap in analyzing how the Website and/or Services are used. For the purpose of the GDPR, Service Providers are considered Data Processors.

**Skytap** (also referred to as either “we”, “us” or “our” in this Privacy Policy) refers to the owner/operator of the Website and Services, Skytap, Inc., 255 S King St, Ste 800, Seattle, WA 98104, [206-866-1162](tel:206-866-1162).

**Usage Data** refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Website and/or Services or from the Website and/or Services infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).

**Website** refers to [www.skytap.com](http://www.skytap.com/).

**You** means the individual accessing or using the Website and/or Services, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Website and/or Services, as applicable.

If GDPR applies to you and your Personal Data, under GDPR, you can be referred to as the Data Subject or as the user when you are the individual using the Website and/or Services. If CCPA/CPRA applies to you and your Personal Information, under CCPA/CPRA, you can be referred to as the Consumer as the individual using the Website and/or Services.

  

### How the Privacy Policy Addresses the Requirements of GDPR and CCPA/CPRA and Any Other Privacy and Data Protection Regulations that Apply in the Future

This Privacy Policy was originally written, revised, and adopted by Skytap with regard to GDPR because GDPR was the first comprehensive and general privacy regulation enacted world-wide that potentially applied to Skytap. California followed GDPR by enacting CCPA, which later was amended by CPRA. Thus, for general purposes and simplicity, (1) the term “Personal Data” in this Privacy Policy more often also will refer to “Personal Information” under CCPA/CPRA and other applicable regulations, (2) the term “Data Subject” in this Privacy Policy will also refer to the persons protected under CCPA/CPRA as a “Consumer”, and (3) the term “Controller” in this Privacy Policy will refer to the persons and organizations regulated by CCPA/CPRA or other regulations (as CCPA/CPRA defines each of these organizations as a “Business”, unless a provision of this Privacy Policy or another related on-line disclosure linked to this Privacy Policy specifically and uniquely refers to CCPA/CPRA, in which case the CCPA/CPRA specifically defined terms from that other regulation may be used instead.

  

### Skytap as a GDPR Data Processor

Skytap primarily provides its customers with virtualized hosting infrastructure, has limited knowledge of customer data within that infrastructure, and only processes hosted data in accordance with the customer’s instructions. Skytap is a Processor of hosted customer data. The customer is the Controller for that hosted customer data.

Skytap hosts information under the direction of its customers and may have no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Data it processes technically through the customers’ use of Skytap’s virtualized infrastructure technology as a subscription service offering, which is part of the Services from Skytap. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their request to the Skytap customer (the Data Controller).

Similarly, Skytap has no direct control over the data collected by its customers. Skytap customers choose the geographical regions for the storage of data for which they are the Controller, are directly responsible for the security, configuration, and administration of their Skytap environments, and are responsible for adhering to legal and regulatory requirements for the data which they collect and process as a Controller.

  

### Skytap as a GDPR Data Controller

In some circumstances, such as during the account registration process for customer use of Skytap Services, Skytap collects and maintains Personal Data. This data is collected and maintained solely for the offer and maintenance of Skytap Services for customer use, and for the relevant communications and uses detailed within this policy. For these purposes, Skytap is the Controller. Skytap also collects Personal Data of the Data Subjects with whom it interacts or wishes to interact with for its general business purpose including sales and marketing of the Skytap Services

The collection and processing of your Personal Data for direct use and administration of our Services is based on contractual obligation, necessary to provide You with access and use of the Services.

  

### Personal Data We Collect

**Information you give us**

Skytap requires some of your Personal Data to effectively operate, while providing you the best experiences with our Website and/or Services. Some of this data comes directly from you when you perform transactions with Skytap, such as place an order, create a Skytap account, administer your organization’s dashboard access, or register for a newsletter. This data may include name, username, title, address, organization or employer, phone number, and/or email address.

**Information we collect automatically**

As is true of most websites, we also gather certain information automatically when you use a Device to visit our Website or interact with our Services. This information is used to analyze aggregated trends and to administer our Website and/or Services, and may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, the type of Device you use, operating system and version, Device identifier, where the application was downloaded from, usage information, events that occur within the application, performance data, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. Please see the [**Cookies and Similar Technology**](#cookies) section below for more details.

**Information we receive from third parties**

We may receive information about You from other sources, including publicly available databases or from third parties. This data helps us to update, expand, and analyze our records, identify possible new customers, and identify Services that may be of interest to You. This may include purchased marketing data about our customers from third parties, that is combined with information we already have about You, to create more tailored marketing content and Services related to You.

#### How We Use Personal Data

This section describes how Skytap uses the Personal Data that we collect to operate our business and to provide you our Website and/or Services, including improvements to the same, and in the personalization of your experiences with the same. We may also use the data to communicate with you, providing account information, security updates and Services information. We may transfer personal information to companies that as a service to us help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers and our agreements with our vendors. Additionally, data is used to market our Services, to comply with applicable laws and legal processes, to enforce our terms and conditions, and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain.

**To provide a requested service or carry out a contract with you**

We use data collected from you in the following ways:

* Customer Support: to diagnose and repair technical issues and provide other customer care and support services.
* Account Notifications: to communicate Services and account notifications to you. For example, we may contact you by phone, email, or other means to inform you of account status, usage, and billing details, and to notify you when security updates are available.
* Security, Safety, and Dispute Resolution: to protect the security and safety of our Website and/or Services and our customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.
* Providing the Services: to carry out your transactions with us and to provide our Services to you, such as the account administration, authorization, and audit tools provided within our Services.

**Where we have a legitimate interest**

We use data collected from you in the following ways:

* Service Personalization: to include personalized features and recommendations that enhance your productivity and user experience enjoyment, and automatically tailor your Service experiences based on the data we have about your activities, interests, and locations. To better understand how to access and control the Personal Data collected for these types of processing, please see the [**Access and Control**](#access-and-control) section below.
* Business Operations: to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions about, and report on the performance of our business.
* Website and/or Services Improvement: to continually improve our Website and/or Services, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features of our Website and/or Services, and usage data to determine new features or Services to prioritize.

Where we rely on legitimate interest for processing your information, we carry out a ‘balancing test’ to ensure that our processing is necessary and that your fundamental rights of privacy are not outweighed by our legitimate interests before we go ahead with such processing. You can find out more about the information in these balancing tests by contacting us using the details below.

**Where we have your consent**

We use data we collect to communicate with you in a variety of formats and to tailor those communications to you. Examples include inviting you to participate in surveys, email subscriptions, and promotional communications from Skytap, by email, SMS, physical mail, or telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, please visit the [**Access and Controls**](#access-and-control) section of this privacy statement.

**Automated decision making**

Skytap employs automated decision making (also known as “profiling”) in the processing of your data in very limited ways, and only in accordance with the specifications of this Policy and applicable laws. For example, we may auto-assign customer support personnel to respond to your inquiries, based on Your organization or employer, and necessary details of that contract, or auto-assign a regional contact to assist you, based on your location. These actions are necessary to provide you with our Services and related support.

Similarly, some automated decision making is used, with your consent, to determine appropriate communications to You, as detailed above.

  

#### Reasons We Share Personal Data

This section describes how Skytap may share and disclose Personal Data. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of data, and Skytap does not control how they choose to share or disclose Information.

Skytap may share your Personal Data with your consent, or as necessary to complete a transaction or provide Services you have requested or authorized. For example:

* If you elect to use connected third-party applications, we may share Personal Data with companies who provide those applications. In those cases, we encourage you to review and understand the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third parties, over whom we have no control.
* We may disclose generic, aggregated (pseudonymized) demographic information, not linked to any specific Data Subject, regarding Skytap visitors and users to our business partners, trusted affiliates, and suppliers or agents working on our behalf.
* We may use third-party service providers to help us operate or administer the Website and/or Services. For example, companies we’ve hired to provide customer service support or to assist in protecting and securing our services and systems may need access to Personal Data to complete those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use Personal Data they receive from us for any other purpose.
* We may disclose Personal Data to a third-party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
* As we believe to be necessary or appropriate, we may disclose Personal Data: (a) under applicable laws, including laws outside Your country of residence; (b) to comply with a subpoena or other legal process; © to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

  

### How We Protect Your Information

Skytap has adopted reasonable security measures to protect Personal Data against loss, theft, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include policies, procedures, employee training, physical access control, and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, Skytap uses industry standard encryption to facilitate the exchange and transmission of data. Skytap only processes Personal Data in compliance with the purposes for which it has been collected, in accordance with this Policy.

In the event that Personal Data is acquired by an unauthorized person, and applicable law requires notification, we will promptly notify the affected Data Subject. Notice will be consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, and any measures necessary for Skytap or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the integrity of a system. Skytap may delay notification if we, or a law enforcement agency, determine that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. In such case, notification will not be provided unless and until we or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.

  

### Data Retention

We only retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for us to use your information as described above or to comply with our legal obligations. Please be advised that this means that we may retain some of Your information after you cease to use our Services. For instance, we may retain your data as necessary to meet our legal obligations, such as for tax and accounting purposes.

When determining the relevant retention periods, we take the following factors into account:

* our contractual obligations and rights in relation to the information involved;
* legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;
* our legitimate interest where we have carried out a balancing test;
* statute of limitations under applicable law(s);
* (potential) disputes;
* if You have made a request to have your information deleted; and
* guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.

Otherwise, we securely erase your information once this is no longer needed.

Further information and advice about Your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in Your country.

This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your Personal Data for marketing purposes. You can review and manage your consent as detailed in the Access and Controls section.
    

  

* * *

  

Please contact us using the details below to exercise any of your rights. We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for:

* baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or
* further copies of the same information.

Alternatively, we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request.

Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. These requests do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Skytap services, or to surveys or other informational communications that can be managed directly (see details in the Access and Controls section). We’ll respond as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within the timeframe of the applicable law.

If you cannot access certain Personal Data collected by Skytap via the Preference Center, directly through the Skytap Services You use, or if You do not have a personal Skytap account, you can always contact Skytap by emailing us at [privacy@skytap.com](mailto:privacy@skytap.com).

* Receive electronic communications from us. Change your mind? Opt-out for those promotional emails.
* Allow the sharing of your Personal Data with our affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. Similarly, you may update your preference to opt-out if you so desire via the Preference Center.
* Skytap may partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites.

If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Skytap is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the DPF, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Skytap, Inc. complies with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and the UK, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Skytap’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. In certain situations, Skytap may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.

**Application of Standard Contractual Clauses or EU-U.S. DPF, UK Extension, and/or Swiss DPF**

Skytap’s default mechanism for addressing personal data transfers is:

* **EU-U.S. DPF** – For data transfers from the EU to the U.S., as of October 9, 2023, Skytap’s certification under the EU-U.S. DPF.
    
* **UK Extension** – Although Skytap has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Government has not yet adopted an adequacy decision with respect to the UK Extension and, therefore, it is not yet in force. Upon the date of the UK Extension’s entry into force, for personal data transfers from the UK to the U.S., Skytap’s certification of the UK Extension.
    
* **Swiss-U.S. DPF** – The Swiss Government is currently engaged in discussions with the U.S. on a framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) substantially similar to the EU-U.S. DPF. When available, Skytap will certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles regarding transfers of personal data from Switzerland to the U.S. When the Swiss Government adopts an adequacy decision with respect to the Swiss-U.S. DPF, on the date of its entry into force, for personal data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S., Skytap’s certification of the Swiss-U.S. PDF.
    

Until entry into force of the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Skytap will offer the Standard Contractual Clauses with provisions to meet the adequacy and security requirements of the UK and Switzerland. Notwithstanding Skytap’s default mechanism for internal data transfers, Skytap will continue to offer the Standard Contractual Clauses for personal data transfers from the EU, the UK, and Switzerland to the U.S., if requested by a Customer.

Please note that any opt out is specific to the browser you use. You may need to opt out on every browser that you use.
