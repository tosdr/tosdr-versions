Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.

The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use or register for the Site.

Intellectual Property Rights
----------------------------

Unless otherwise indicated, the Site is our proprietary property and all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics on the Site (collectively, the “**Content**”) and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the “**Marks**”) are owned or controlled by us or licensed to us, and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws of the United States, foreign jurisdictions, and international conventions. The Content and the Marks are provided on the Site “**AS IS**” for your information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, no part of the Site and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without our express prior written permission.

Provided that you are eligible to use the Site, you are granted a limited license to access and use the Site and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly gained access solely for your personal, non-commercial use. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to the Site, the Content, and the Marks.

User Representations
--------------------

By using the Site, you represent and warrant that: (1) all registration information you submit will be true, accurate, current, and complete; (2) you will maintain the accuracy of such information and promptly update such registration information as necessary; (3) you have the legal capacity and you agree to comply with these Terms of Use; (4) you are not a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside; (5) you will not access the Site through automated or non-human means, whether through a bot, script, or otherwise; (6) you will not use the Site for any illegal or unauthorized purpose; and (7) your use of the Site will not violate any applicable law or regulation.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site (or any portion thereof).

User Registration
-----------------

You may be required to register with the Site. You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your account and password. We reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.

Subscriptions and Payments
--------------------------

UTunnel’s services are available to you upon a paid subscription on the Site or via in-app purchases in the UTunnel mobile applications. UTunnel subscription payments are charged on a monthly basis, with a billing cycle that begins on the date of your first subscription. A complete list of UTunnel subscription plans and pricing is available on our pricing page. Your service will be automatically renewed at the end of each billing cycle and the subscription amount will be charged automatically to the payment method you last selected.

Credit Notes
------------

When a subscription plan is downgraded or the number of subscribed user licences is reduced before the end of the current billing cycle, a prorated credit note is issued. If you have credit notes in your account, the total amount available as credit notes will be adjusted against your next month’s invoice. If you purchase a new subscription after the credit note is created, you can also apply the credits to that invoice.

Suspension for Nonpayment
-------------------------

If we are unable to charge the subscription fee to your payment method on the renewal date, we may at our discretion notify you about the payment failure, make another attempt to charge your payment, or suspend your use of UTunnel services.

Cancellation and Refund Policy
------------------------------

You can cancel your UTunnel subscription any time you want. To cancel the subscriptions that you no longer require, you need to login to your UTunnel account, navigate to the subscription page, and do so. UTunnel offers either a 14-day free trial period or 14-day money-back guarantee for the first UTunnel services subscription on your account, based on the service type you choose.

If the 14-day free trial period is applicable in the case of a subscription, and you won't be charged anything if you cancel during this trial period. We will start charging the subscription charges once the free trial period is over.

If the 14-day money-back guarantee is applicable, you will be charged in advance for the subscription. In the event of a subscription cancellation within the 14-day money-back period, a refund will be issued, deducting any applicable Cloud Gateway usage fees for the days of active subscription. This refund will be processed to the original payment method within 10 business days.

If you cancel your UTunnel subscription after the 14-day trial or money-back period, the subscription continues until the end of the current billing cycle.

Privacy Policy

We care about data privacy and security. Please review our Privacy Policy: [https://www.utunnel.io/privacy-policy](https://www.utunnel.io/privacy-policy). By using the Site, you agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms of Use.

The Site is hosted in the United States. If you access the Site from Asia, Australia, or any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in the United States, then through your continued use of the Site, you are transferring your data to the United States, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in the United States. If you access or use the Site from or you are based in the European Union or European Economic Area, you guarantee that you have legal grounds to transfer personal data to the United States and agree to the terms of the [Data Processing Agreement and Standard Contractual Clauses](https://www.utunnel.io/data-processing-agreement) available at the Site.

We do not knowingly accept, request, or solicit information from children or knowingly market to children. Therefore, in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, if we receive actual knowledge that anyone under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from the Site as quickly as is reasonably practical.

Copyright Infringements
-----------------------

We respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that any material available on or through the Site infringes upon any copyright you own or control, please immediately notify us using the contact information provided below (a “**Notification**”). A copy of your Notification will be sent to the person who posted or stored the material addressed in the Notification. Please be advised that pursuant to federal law you may be held liable for damages if you make material misrepresentations in a Notification. Thus, if you are not sure that material located on or linked to by the Site infringes your copyright, you should consider first contacting an attorney.

Term and Termination
--------------------

These Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Site. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF USE, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE, TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OF USE OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE SITE OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.

Modifications And Interruptions
-------------------------------

We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of the Site at any time or for any reason at our sole discretion without notice. However, we have no obligation to update any information on our Site. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or part of the Site without notice at any time. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Site.

We cannot guarantee the Site will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the Site, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Site at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use the Site during any downtime or discontinuance of the Site. Nothing in these Terms of Use will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Site or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.

Governing Law
-------------

These Terms of Use and your use of the Site are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Pennsylvania applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the state of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

UTunnel Services are subject to the trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“**OFAC**”). By accessing the Services, you agree to comply with these laws and regulations. Specifically, you represent and warrant that you are not (a) located in any country that is **subject to OFAC’s trade and economic sanctions, currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria**; or (b) an individual or entity included on any U.S. lists of prohibited parties including: the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals List (“**SDN List**”) and Sectoral Sanctions List (“**SSI List**”). Additionally, you agree not to – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any service received from UTunnel in contradiction with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of your Account.

Dispute Resolution
------------------

**Informal Negotiations**

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a "**Dispute**" and collectively, the “**Disputes**”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “**Party**” and collectively, the “**Parties**”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

**Binding Arbitration**

If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA**") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("**AAA Consumer Rules**"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Pennsylvania. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Pennsylvania, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.

To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
