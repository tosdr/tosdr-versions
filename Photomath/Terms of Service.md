1\. Introduction
----------------

Our Services consist of the Photomath application that helps users to solve math problems (the “Application”), and the related website located at [photomath.com](https://photomath.com/) (the “Site”), including all content provided through the Application and/or the Site. When we speak of “Photomath”, “we”, “us” and “our” we mean Photomath LLC and its affiliates.

These Terms of Service (collectively, the “Terms”) govern your use of the Services. These Terms help define the relationship between you and Photomath. It is important that you read and understand the Terms because to use the Services you must accept these Terms. If you do not accept or understand the Terms, please do not use, download, access or register with the Services. Besides these Terms, we also publish a privacy policy at [photomath.com/privacy](https://photomath.com/privacy). We encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage and delete your information.

As used in these Terms, “you” and “user” means the individual or entity using the Service. To use our Service on behalf of an entity, you must be authorized to accept these Terms on behalf of that entity.

If you have any questions about these Terms or our Privacy Policy, please see our contact information in Section 19 (Contact).

We wish to remind you that the Photomath Application is an educational tool and should be used as an aid and learning tool. Using it for cheating on exams or homework will primarily hurt you, as you will not properly learn math and math thinking. Be smart and use it only for your advancements in math learning. Not cheating.

2\. Modifications to the Services and these Terms
-------------------------------------------------

**2.1** As part of the continual evolution of our Service, we may make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our Service for these other reasons: (1) to adapt to new technologies, (2) to reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use our Service, (3) to respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with others, (4) to prevent abuse or harm or (5) to address legal, regulatory, or security issues. From time to time we make legally required updates, which are modifications that keep the Service in conformity with the law. We make these updates for safety or security reasons, and to make sure the Service meets the quality standards that you expect. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed. If a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our Service, or if we stop offering a service all together, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, including a description of the changes, when they’ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact.

**2.2** From time to time, we may modify or amend these Terms (1) to reflect changes in our Service – for example, when we add new features, technologies, pricing or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm. If we do so, we will post any such modifications or changes in the Service. You can tell when changes have been made and will be effective by referring to the “Effective” date legend on top of this page. If we materially change the Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new feature or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new Terms, you should stop using our Service and you must promptly uninstall and delete all copies of the Application.

10\. Purchases and Payments
---------------------------

Photomath makes certain premium features or content, including Photomath Plus, available for purchase (each a “Paid Service”). The Paid Services will be billed through Google Play Store or iOS App Store. Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order a subscription) you will enter into a separate contract for that particular Paid Service on these Terms.

No cost trials

We may offer no-cost trials for a Paid Service to subscribers from time to time. If you purchase a Paid Service that includes access to a trial, you will receive access to the Paid Service for the duration of the trial period. At the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged the price of the subscription and will continue to be charged until you cancel your subscription. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period. Please note that if you purchase a subscription for a Paid Service that includes a no-cost trial, the period during which you can exercise a withdrawal right (and request a refund if applicable) begins at the beginning of the trial, not when you are subsequently billed for the subscription.

Cancellations and refunds

You may cancel a Paid Service by following the steps outlined [here](https://support.google.com/photomath/answer/14336662?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&sjid=7719773808626505509-EU). Once you’ve cancelled, you won’t be charged again and your benefits will continue until the end of the billing cycle. After that point, you will no longer be able to use your benefits.

Paid Services purchased through the Google Play Store are subject to the refund process and policies located at: [https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637). Paid Services purchased through the iOS App Store are subject to the refund process and policies located at: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084). Except as otherwise stated in these Terms, or the Google Play Store and iOS App Store refund policies, if you cancel a Paid Service you will not be eligible for a refund (or any alternative remedy) unless the Paid Services are defective, unavailable, or don’t perform as stated.

Price increases

When you purchase a Paid Service, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your agreement to subscribe. If the price of a recurring Paid Service, such as a subscription, increases later, we will notify you. The increase will apply to the next payment due from you following such notice, provided that you have been given at least 30 days’ prior notice before the change is made. If you are given less than 30 days’ prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due. If you do not wish to pay the increased price for a subscription, you may cancel the subscription prior to the next billing date as described above.

Taxes

If Photomath is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction.

11\. Legal guarantee, warranties and disclaimers
------------------------------------------------

For EEA-based consumers only:If you’re an EEA-based consumer and you’ve agreed to our Terms, then EEA consumer laws provide you with a legal guarantee covering the Service that we provide you. Under this guarantee, we’re liable for any lack of conformity that you discover within two years of the one-time supply of digital content or at any time during the “continuous” supply of the Service.

Your national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren’t limited by any other commercial guarantees that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please contact us.

For US-based users only:

IF YOU’RE A US-BASED USER, THEN TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT THE CONTENT OR FEATURES OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THEIR ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.

For all other users:

We provide our Services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in [this warranty](#11-legal-guarantee-warranties-and-disclaimers), you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

The only commitments we make about our Services (including the content in the Services, the specific functions of our Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) this warranty section; and (2) laws that can’t be limited by these Terms.

12\. Translations
-----------------

Part of the Service has been translated from English to other languages for your convenience using translation software powered by Google Translate. Reasonable efforts have been made to provide an accurate translation, however, no automated translation is perfect nor is it intended to replace human translators. Translations are provided as an ancillary service to users of the Service, and might sometimes be inaccurate. Some content (such as images, videos, Flash, etc.) may not be accurately translated due to the limitations of the translation software.

The official text is the English version of the website. If any questions arise related to the accuracy of the information contained in the translated website, please refer to the English version of the website which is the official version.

13\. Liability
--------------

These Terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These Terms don’t limit liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or death or personal injury caused by negligence or willful misconduct.

Other than the liabilities described above, we are liable only for our breaches of these Terms, subject to applicable law.

If you’re a business user or an entity:

* To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify us for any third-party legal proceedings arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the Service or violation of these Terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
    
* We won’t be responsible for the following liabilities: loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings, indirect or consequential loss, or punitive damages.
    
* Our total liability to you for any and all claims arising from these terms shall under no circumstances exceed the fees, if any, that you have paid to us for access to and use of the service.
    
* In some jurisdictions the applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in these Terms removes or supersedes your rights as a consumer based on mandatory provisions of law.
    

14\. Entire Agreement
---------------------

These Terms contain the entire understanding between You and Photomath, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof.

15\. Waiver and Severability
----------------------------

Our failure to exercise any rights under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

16\. Governing Law and Resolution of Disputes
---------------------------------------------

If you’re a resident of, or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, these Terms and your relationship with Photomath under these Terms are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts.

If you’re an EEA-based consumer, please contact us to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an Online Dispute Resolution Platform, which we accept if required by law.

If you are not a resident of or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland or an EEA-based consumer, then California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Photomath consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

17\. Assignment
---------------

We may transfer our obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time without your consent as long as it does not reduce your guarantees.

18\. Termination
----------------

We reserve the right terminate or suspend your access to the Service if any of these things happen: (1) you materially or repeatedly breach these Terms, (2) we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order, (3) we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party or Photomath or (4) you are a repeat copyright infringer. If you believe your access to the Service has been suspended or terminated in error, please contact us. Upon termination of the Service or a part thereof, your license to use the Service or a part thereof will be automatically terminated. Following termination, all such terms that by their nature may survive termination of these Terms shall be deemed to survive such termination.

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our Service at any time. If you’re an EEA/UK-based consumer, you can also withdraw from these Terms within 14 days of accepting them.

EEA right of withdrawalIf you’re an EEA-based consumer, you have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

UK right of withdrawalIf you’re purchasing Paid Services as a UK-based consumer, you have the right by law to withdraw from contracts for purchases of services within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire 14 days after the conclusion of the contract.

You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

Effects of withdrawalIf you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
