Cookies Policy

Cookies Policy
==============

Effective: April 2024

Moodle Pty Ltd uses cookies on its websites (collectively the “Sites”). This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how Moodle uses cookies, how third-parties we partner with may use cookies on the Sites, and your choices regarding cookies. Please read this Cookies Policy in conjunction with our [Privacy Notice](https://moodle.com/privacy-notice/) which sets out additional details on how Moodle uses personally identifiable information and your various rights.

#### What are cookies

Cookies are small pieces of text sent by your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Site or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Site more useful to you. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the Moodle servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Site and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalise your experience on our Site.

Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” cookies.

#### How Moodle uses cookies

When you use and access the Site, Moodle may place a number of cookies files in your web browser.

Moodle uses or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Sites links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Sites, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. To the extent that cookies data constitutes personally identifiable information, we process such data on the basis of your consent.

We use both session and persistent cookies on across our various Sites and we use different types of cookies to run such Sites:

* _Essential cookies._ Necessary for the operation of the Site(s). We may use essential cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of user accounts, or offer Site features.
* _Analytical/performance cookies._ Allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and see how visitors move around the Site(s) when using it. This helps us improve the way the Site(s) work.
* _Functionality cookies._ Used to recognise you when you return to the Site(s). This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* _Targeting cookies._ Record your visit to the Site(s), the pages you have visited, and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make the Site(s) and the more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.

To view a list of Moodle cookies, please view our [Cookies table.](#cookie)

#### Third-party cookies

In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the Sites and refine marketing efforts.

* _Tracking cookies._ Follow on-site behaviour and tie it to other metrics allowing better understanding of usage habits.
* _Optimization cookies._ Allow real-time tracking of user conversion from different marketing channels to evaluate their effectiveness.
* _Partner cookies._ Provide marketing conversion metrics to our partners so they can optimise their paid marketing efforts.

To view a list of third-party cookies that we use, please refer to our [Cookies table.](#cookie)

#### What are your choices regarding cookies

If you’d like to delete cookies or instruct your web browser to delete or refuse cookies, please visit the help pages of your web browser.

Please note, however, that if you delete cookies or refuse to accept them, you might not be able to use some or all of the features we offer. You may not be able to log in, store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display properly.
