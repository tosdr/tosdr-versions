Privacy Policy
==============

Rethink DNS + Firewall are anti-surveillance tools first and foremost: It is absolutely against our ethos, then, to track users of our apps and services, or sell any information whatsoever to any third-party in any form, pseudo-anonymized, de-anonymized, anonymized, aggregated, or otherwise.

App Privacy Policy
------------------

We do not collect, sell, license, share any data (personally identifiable or otherwise) from the [Rethink DNS + Firewall Android app](https://rethinkdns.com/download).

Revision: 21 Oct 2020

* The app is free of any trackers, spyware, ads, or loggers whatsoever. This can be, to an extent, ascertained from our code which is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/celzero/brave-android-app).
* The app does not use or depend on or embed any third-party services in its default setting. The only exception is Google PlayStore (see their [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)) which is used as an app distribution channel.
* The app does not collect any debug or diagnostic data unless you explicitly choose to share it with us, for example, over [\[email protected\]](https://rethinkdns.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

DNS Privacy Policy
------------------

We do not collect, sell, license, share any personally identifiable data from our DNS resolvers. The [code is open source](https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/) so you may inspect it yourself or deploy to your servers.

Revision: 14 Oct 2022

For stub resolvers: `https://basic.rethinkdns.com/<config>` and `https://sky.rethinkdns.com/<config-id>`

* The resolver does not collect personally identifiable information nor does it seek to profile a user or a group of users.
* This DNS-over-HTTPS resolver runs on Cloudflare's network whose privacy policy you may find [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

For recursive resolver: `https://max.rethinkdns.com/<config>`

* The resolver does not collect personally identifiable information nor does it seek to profile a user or a group of users.
* This DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS recursive resolver runs on Fly.io whose privacy policy you may find [here](https://fly.io/legal/privacy-policy/).
