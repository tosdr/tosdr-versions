Privacy Policy
==============

![](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fftf-white-logo.png)

[Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/) is committed to protecting your privacy. If you sign onto one of our various mailing lists, petitions, or use our contact tools, we retain the information you provided to primarily manage our mailing lists, and secondarily to transmit only the information that is required to service providers and public officials when required to submit your communications with them.

We do not sell our email list. We do not share or distribute your contact information unless specifically stated so.

If you sign up to volunteer or RSVP to a local event—for example by submitting your phone number in a volunteer signup field—we may share your contact information with partner organizations, third party services, or other volunteers, for the purposes of volunteer coordination only.

For petitions, open letters, or similar public communications that you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to public officials as part of a petition or open letter, and they may make it public.

If you enter your information as part of a clearly-labeled “joint action” with another organization, we may share your name, email and other information you have entered with the partner organization(s) for that particular action. If you are submitting your information to one of these campaigns or websites, you are opting into the sharing of your information for the stated purposes and will be treated as so.

We sometimes carry out our business or operate our website using third party tools or services. Information may be shared with the operators of those tools or services in connection with our use of those tools or services to carry out business or operate our website.

[Demand Progress/Demand Progress Education Fund](https://demandprogress.org/) takes your privacy very seriously. We do not share your email address or other personal information with unauthorized entities without your permission.

We use the information we collect to inform you of news, activism opportunities, and other matters that relate to Demand Progress/Demand Progress Education Fund, and to deliver petition signatures, emails/letters, and similar communications to designated targets.

For petitions, emails/letters, or similar public communications that you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street or email address publicly available, but we may transmit such information to public officials/petition targets as part of a petition, open letter, or similar correspondence. (For instance, this information must be included to enable delivery of emails to members of Congress or comments to administrative agencies.)

DP (501(c)4 arm) and DPEF (our 501(c)3 arm) have a resource sharing agreement that enables each to contact activists whose contact information was gathered by the other. Our 501(c4) arm and our 527 entity (also called Demand Progress) also have such a resource sharing agreement.

DP/DPEF owns and administers the Watchdog.net site. And as of the summer of 2013, DP/DPEF owns and administers Rootstrikers.org. DP/DPEF may contact subscribers to the Watchdog.net and Rootstrikers.org sublists. You may unsubscribe from email alerts from any or all of DP/DPEF, Rootstrikers.org, or Watchdog.net at any time.

If you enter your information as part of an action that is organized in partnership with one or more other organizations, and labeled as such, then we may share your name, email, and other information you have entered with the partner organization(s) for that particular action. We house data in accounts we hold with vendors such as ActionKit and Action Network. We sometimes enlist third-party vendors to help us manage data. We may use cookies from third parties such as Google Adwords to serve ads based on usage of this site.

If you sign up to volunteer — for example by submitting your phone number in a volunteer signup field — we may share your contact information with partner organizations, third party services, or other volunteers, for the purposes of volunteer coordination.

DP is a fiscally sponsored project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and DPEF is a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, don’t hesitate to [contact us](mailto:contact@demandprogress.org).
