12\. Domain Name Dispute Resolution Decision Terms

CIRA Domain Name Dispute Resolution Decisions (“CDRD”) are not edited in any way whatsoever by CIRA. They are drafted by independent parties who are not connected to CIRA, and CIRA does not accept any responsibility for any inaccuracies or mistakes the drafters of CDRDs may make. Your use of the CDRDs is at your own risk, without any representations, warranties, or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied. CIRA will not, under any circumstances, be liable to you or any other person for any loss or damage arising from, connected with, or relating to the use of CDRDs by you or any other person. Therefore, it is imperative for anyone relying on a CDRD to double check the references to the dispute resolution rules and policy and, if necessary, make appropriate arrangements to ensure accuracy and reliability of the decision. Further, translations of CDRDs have been prepared for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to be relied upon as advice on any particular matter. If you want to rely upon a translated CDRD, you should obtain your own certified translation from a qualified interpreter or translator. CIRA will indicate on each translated decision that it is provided for convenience only.
