### SketchUp Pro

#### What we collect

SketchUp Pro validates the software license at the time of installation, and collects activation details when the product starts up. The activation details provide anonymized information regarding the environment the application is running in. Specifically, we capture the following:

* Globally unique user ID - Completely anonymous
    
* License state - Trial vs Purchased
    
* Basic product information such as version, operating environment, language, and OpenGL version
    

Network versions of SketchUp Pro also collect information to make sure that the software is used in compliance with the number of licenses purchased. If, for example, a user purchased a network license with 200 seats, we will count how many seats are currently being used and will allow 200 clients to runs concurrently.

SketchUp Pro uses third-party software to collect error and crash information. The collection and submission of data is voluntary and you will be asked whether or not you would like to submit the information at the time of the crash.

SketchUp Pro relies on Trimble ID for authentication and does not store any user information within the product. Trimble ID collects your first and last name, and email address. This information is required to utilize any products which require authentication (sign in).

#### How we use that information

The metrics are anonymous and we use the data to validate software use and prevent piracy. We also use them to understand product usage and to improve the product’s performance.

### SketchUp for Schools

This SketchUp for Schools Privacy Notice for Children (“Children’s Privacy Notice”) supplements the [Trimble Privacy Notice](https://www.trimble.com/en/our-commitment/responsible-business/data-privacy-and-security/data-privacy-center/privacy-notice) by providing additional information about how we process the personal information of children under the age of 13 and student users of SketchUp for Schools at a K-12 educational institution (collectively “children”).

This Children’s Privacy Notice sets forth:

* The categories of children’s personal information (“CPI”) that we receive.
    
* How we use the CPI we receive.
    
* Our practices for disclosing CPI.
    

Most Trimble websites, products and services (“applications”) are primarily designed for adults. We refer to applications designed for adults as “general audience applications.” We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in connection with general audience applications. Certain Trimble applications are appropriate for and are intended for use by children. We refer to these applications as “children’s applications.” At this time, SketchUp for Schools is Trimble’s only children’s application.

Where there is a conflict between this Children’s Privacy Notice and the Trimble Privacy Notice, this Children’s Privacy Notice sets the standard for how we treat CPI, consistent with applicable law.

If we discover that we have processed CPI in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, we will promptly delete the data or bring that processing into compliance with applicable law, such as by obtaining appropriate permission for that processing.

We only access as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to use the children’s applications. We do not condition a student’s participation on the disclosure of more CPI than is reasonably necessary and we do not store any CPI.

**What we access**

Access to the children’s applications is only available through an integration with either Google for Education or Microsoft for Education (each a “Login/Storage Provider”). A K-12 educational institution (“Educational Institution”) that wants its students to use the children’s applications must have a valid account with the Login/Storage Provider (“Service Account”). Likewise, each of the Educational Institution’s students and other permitted users (i.e. administrators) must have a valid Service Account to access the children’s applications.

Students will log in through their Service Account and SketchUp may access and use the child’s first name, last name, email, Login/Storage Provider username and profile picture, which CPI is hosted by the Login/Storage Provider and provided to SketchUp via the integration with the Login/Storage Providers. We do not store any CPI nor transmit any CPI to third parties. For more information, please visit the [SketchUp for Schools Offering Terms](https://www.sketchup.com/en/edu-tos).

We also use technology to automatically collect information from our users, including children, when they access and navigate through the children’s application and use certain of its features. The usage information we collect through these technologies may include information about actions that users take, where users are geographically located, and the devices and operating systems used (“Usage Data”). The Usage Data is anonymized and not able to be linked to an individual.

**How we use that information**

We use the CPI specified herein to:

* Perform account authentication; and
    
* Provide access to and functionality within the children’s application.
    

We use the Usage Data we collect automatically through technology to improve our children’s applications, perform analytics and understand product usage and performance. We may disclose Usage Data to third parties.

We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any CPI to third parties.

**How to access, update, and protect information**

We understand that the security of your data is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect user data. In addition, SketchUp for Schools does not store any CPI. Data requests, including requests for access, deletion, or correction, must be submitted to [Google for Education](https://edu.google.com/workspace-for-education/editions/education-fundamentals/) or [Microsoft Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education), as applicable.
