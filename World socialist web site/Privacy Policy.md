* To provide you with news, special offers and general information about other goods, services and events which we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about unless you have opted not to receive such information

#### Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), World Socialist Web Site legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.

World Socialist Web Site may process your Personal Data because:

* We need to perform a contract with you
* You have given us permission to do so
* The processing is in our legitimate interests and is not overridden by your rights
* For payment processing purposes
* To comply with the law

#### Retention of Data

World Socialist Web Site will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

World Socialist Web Site will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

#### Browser Data

While using our website, information is automatically saved on our servers in log files that your browser transmits to us. These include the name and version of the browser, the operating system used, the host name and IP address of the accessing computer, the referrer URL (previously visited page) and the time of the server request.

This logging is done for security reasons. The data is stored for a maximum of two weeks and then deleted automatically. The data will not be deleted if, in the opinion of the World Socialist Web Site, they provide information about attacks on the World Socialist Web Site, their information and communication technology or persons or threats of such attacks. In that case the World Socialist Web Site will promptly clarify and then delete the data or take necessary technical or legal steps to avert the attacks or threats.

#### Analytics

We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.

**Matomo**

We use Matomo, an open source software for the statistical analysis of visitor access. Matomo stores cookies in your browser for analysis purposes. The information generated by these cookies about your use of the website is stored on our servers. Your IP address will be anonymized immediately after processing and prior to its storage. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website will not be disclosed to third parties. You can prevent the use of cookies in the settings of your browser (see also Cookies).

If you do not agree with the storage and evaluation of this data from your visit, then you can object to the storage and use below at any time. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie is stored in your browser, with the result that Matomo does not collect any session data. Attention: If you delete your cookies, this means that the opt-out cookie is also deleted and may need to be reactivated by you.

**Google Analytics**

Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

GetSiteControl can only collect personally identifiable information if you provide your information through a form submission. However, it can collect IP addresses, browser types, system types, and referring URLs.

While GetSiteControl adds a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but GetSiteControl. GetSiteControl’s ability to use and share information collected by their software about your visits to our site is restricted by GetSiteControl’s Privacy Policy. You can prevent GetSiteControl from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

#### Transfer of Data

If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United States and process it there.
