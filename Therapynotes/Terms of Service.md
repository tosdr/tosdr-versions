    7. ### Telehealth
        
        Telehealth is included as a component of the Service and gives Providers the ability to schedule and connect remotely with patients for delivery of care.

THERAPYNOTES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY IDENTITY, LOCATION, OR AGE VERIFICATION, PROFESSIONAL, DIAGNOSTIC OR MEDICAL SERVICES, MEDICAL OR BEHAVIORAL/MENTAL HEALTH ADVICE, MEDICATION RECOMMENDATIONS OR PRESCRIPTIONS PROVIDED OR COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE TELEHEALTH SERVICE COMPONENT. Additionally, Provider accepts full responsibility for verifying the internet connection and hardware configuration of the telehealth session. TherapyNotes accepts no responsibility or liability for internet connections/outages, hardware issues, third-party outages or interruptions, or any other interruptions or outages to the telehealth session.

        If you send us feedback, ideas, suggestions, or other materials in regard to the Services (other than your User Data), you waive any potential Intellectual Property Rights and agree that we are free to use it for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.

4. HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION
    --------------------------
    
    1. ### We Do Not Provide Medical Advice or Medical Services
        
        Our Services, including Telehealth, are intended to foster enhanced communications and coordination between our Users and Providers, including healthcare professionals. TherapyNotes itself does not provide professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
        
        THERAPYNOTES IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES FROM PROVIDERS, SUCH AS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING ANSWERS TO ANY HEALTH-RELATED QUESTION SUBMITTED THROUGH THE SERVICES. ANY INFORMATION THAT THERAPYNOTES ITSELF MAY PROVIDE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND IS NOT INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, NOR DOES IT REPLACE, PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. NOTHING STATED OR POSTED ON THE SERVICES BY THERAPYNOTES IS INTENDED TO BE, AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO BE, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, DENTISTRY, NURSING, OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARE ADVICE, OR THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL CARE.
        
        DO NOT DISREGARD, AVOID, OR DELAY OBTAINING MEDICAL ADVICE FROM A QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. DO NOT USE THE SERVICES FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCY NEEDS. IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CALL A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND 911. YOUR USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
        
        We do not recommend or endorse any specific Providers, tests, procedures, opinions, or other information that may appear through the Services. If you rely on any information provided through the Services, you do so solely at your own risk.
        
        Our Services are provided to Users through TherapyPortal.com free of charge. Usual, customary, and any other charges for any medical or related services rendered by Providers will apply and will be entirely your responsibility (including through your insurance). You must resolve any dispute between you or any Provider directly with the Provider, even if scheduling or other interactions were facilitated by our Services.
        
    2. ### No Doctor Patient Relationship
        
        NO LICENSED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IS CREATED BY USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY, OR THROUGH THE USE OF, THE SERVICES OR THROUGH ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM US. WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERTISE, QUALITY OF WORK, PRICE OR COST INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, WE DO NOT IN ANY WAY ENDORSE OR RECOMMEND ANY INDIVIDUAL LISTED OR ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN BY YOU IN RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION.
        
        We have no control over, and cannot guarantee the availability of, any Provider at any particular time. We will not be liable for cancelled or otherwise unfulfilled appointments, or any injury resulting therefrom, or for any other injury resulting or arising from or related to the use of the Services whatsoever.
        
        You are strongly advised to perform your own investigation prior to selecting a Provider by contacting the appropriate licensing or certification authorities to verify listed credentials and education, and to further verify information about a particular Provider by confirming with the Provider's office, your current Provider, the medical association relative to the Provider's specialty and your relevant state board.
        
    3. ### Important Information About Provider Relationships And Lists; Authorization And Acknowledgement
        
        In connection with using the Services to locate and schedule appointments with Providers, you understand that YOU ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING YOUR OWN PROVIDER.
        
        Providers listed or accessible through the Services with whom you may book appointments enter into contracts with us and such Providers generally pay us a fee in order to be listed and/or marketed through the Services. We may provide you with lists and/or profile previews of Providers who may be suitable to deliver the healthcare that you are seeking based on information that you provide to us (such as insurance information, proximity to your geographical location, and specialty of the Provider). In an effort to aid in the discovery of Providers and enable the maximum choice and diversity of Providers who participate in the Services, these lists and/or profile previews may also be based on other criteria (including, for example, Provider availability, past selections by and/or ratings of Providers by you or by other of our users, and past experience of our users with Providers); but we (a) do not recommend or endorse any Providers, (b) do not make any representations or warranties with respect to these Providers or the quality of the healthcare services they may provide, and (c) do not receive any additional fees from Providers for featuring them (i.e., higher or better placement on lists) through the Services.
        
        IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, YOU MAY AFFIRMATIVELY DIRECT AND AUTHORIZE US TO SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH ONE OR MORE SPECIFIED PROVIDER(S), INCLUDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION.
        
    4. ### Editorial Control

You are encouraged to independently verify any such information.

16. DMCA POLICY
    -----------
    
    1. ### Generally
        
        TherapyNotes will respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to an online Provider concerning alleged copyright infringement. When a valid DMCA notification is received, the Provider responds under this process by taking down the offending content. On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so that a counter-notification may be filed. On receiving a valid counter-notification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.
        
    2. ### Filing a Notification
        
        A written notification must be made. This can be done either by fax or written letter (regular mail or courier). Emails will not be accepted unless a prior arrangement has been made. The notification must:
        
        1. Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed upon (i.e., describe the work that you own).
        2. Identify the item that you claim is infringing on your copyright.
        3. Provide a reasonably sufficient method of contacting you; phone number and email address would be preferred.
        4. Include the following statement: "I have good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above and maintained by the Services is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by protection of law."
        5. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
        6. Sign the paper.
        
          
        
        Please note: The DMCA provides that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you falsely claim that an item is infringing your copyrights. We recommend contacting an attorney if you are unsure whether an object is protected by copyright laws.

    2. ### Data Processing and Protection
        
        You are a Business and you designate TherapyNotes as your Service Provider to Collect and Process Personal Information for the Business Purposes as stated herein. However, there are circumstances where TherapyNotes is also a Business and Collects and Processes Personal Information on its own behalf. Where TherapyNotes is acting as your Service Provider, we are responsible for compliance with our obligations under this Addendum and for compliance with our obligations as a Service Provider under the CCPA and the CPRA. We will provide the same level of privacy protection as is required of a Business under the CCPA/CPRA. You are responsible for compliance with your own obligations as a Business under the CCPA and the CPRA and shall ensure that you have provided notice and have obtained or shall obtain all consents and rights necessary under the CCPA and the CPRA for TherapyNotes to Collect and Process the Personal Information for the Business Purpose.
        
    3. ### Business Purpose
        
        TherapyNotes shall only Collect and Process Personal Information as a Service Provider upon lawful documented instructions from you, including those in the Agreement, or as otherwise necessary to provide the Services (the “Business Purpose”). Specifically, the Business Purpose is related to the TherapyNotes practice management system with functionality to manage patient records, schedule appointments, meet with patients remotely, electronically prescribe medication, create rich documentation, to bill the patient and insurance companies, and other functionality related to the delivery of the Services.

    4. ### Not a Sale or Sharing of Personal Information
        
        Where TherapyNotes acts as a Service Provider the disclosure of Personal Information to us by you in the course of the delivery of, use of and access to the Services does not, and shall not, constitute a Sale or Sharing under the CPRA.
        
    5. ### Service Provider Data Processing Responsibilities
        
        TherapyNotes shall not: (a) Sell or Share the Personal Information; (b) retain, or disclose the Personal Information for any purpose other than for the Business Purpose, including to retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information for a purpose other than providing its Services under the Agreement or as permitted by the CCPA/CPRA; (c) retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information outside of the direct business relationship between TherapyNotes and Provider; (d) Process the Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising (however, Provider may disclose Personal Information to TherapyNotes for non-personalized advertising as a permissible Business Purpose); (e) combine Personal Information with any other data to the extent this would be inconsistent with the limitations on service providers under the CPRA.
        
    6. ### Consumer's Rights

If TherapyNotes is contacted by a Consumer who is your patient/client, TherapyNotes will re-direct that Consumer to you for assistance with the Personal Information request, when TherapyNotes is reasonably able to identity the Consumer as belonging to your practice.
        
    8. ### Review and Remediation
        
        With notice to TherapyNotes and its reasonable consent, Business may take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that TherapyNotes uses the Personal Information that it Collected pursuant to this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Business's obligations under the CCPA/CPRA. Business may also, with notice to TherapyNotes, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate TherapyNotes' unauthorized use of Personal Information.
        
    9. ### Sensitive Personal Information
        
        If Provider receives direction from a Consumer not to use or disclose such Consumer's Sensitive Personal Information and TherapyNotes is assisting Provider in respect of such Sensitive Personal Information, then Provider agrees to promptly notify TherapyNotes that Consumer has provided Provider with such direction and to provide details of the Consumer and the Sensitive Personal Information in question. Upon receiving such notice, TherapyNotes agrees to not use such Sensitive Personal Information for any purpose, except for the permissible purposes authorized by Section 1798.121(a) of the CPRA. Provider acknowledges and agrees that TherapyNotes is only required to limit its use of Sensitive Personal Information it receives if instructed by Provider to do so and only with respect to its relationship with Provider.
        
    10. ### Technical Security Measures
        
        TherapyNotes shall implement and maintain appropriate and reasonable security measures to protect Personal Information.

        TherapyNotes will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, notify you without undue delay (and in time to fulfill any Security Breach reporting obligations) after becoming aware of a Security Breach incident and provide timely information relating to the Security Breach incident as it becomes known or is reasonably requested by you. We will use the contact information for you that we have on record.
        
    12. ### Specific Indemnification
        
    
    In the event you fail to obtain necessary consents to use Personal Information, or you fail to fully comply with the Agreement, the CCPA and/or CPRA, you shall indemnify, defend and hold TherapyNotes harmless from any claims, demands, allegations, damages, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising from such actions or inactions.
