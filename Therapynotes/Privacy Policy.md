TherapyNotes Privacy Policy
---------------------------

Last Updated: December 14, 2022

TherapyNotes, LLC (“**TherapyNotes**,” “**Company**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) is designed to help you understand how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our TherapyNotes.com and TherapyPortal.com websites, applications, or other online services we provide (collectively, the “**Services**”). By accessing the TherapyNotes.com or TherapyPortal.com website or using our Services, you accept our Privacy Policy and [Terms of Service](https://www.therapyportal.com/portal/legal/usertermsofservice/)  (collectively, the “**Agreement**”) and your consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy does not address the privacy practices of any third party, including those with whom your information may be shared through your use of the Services. Please be sure to review the privacy practices of any third party prior to sharing your information.

Information We Collect
----------------------

Some information we collect cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information, referring/exit pages and URLs, preferences you submit, and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks (collectively, “**Non-Personal Information**”).

We also collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual consumer or household (“**Personal Information**”). We collect Personal Information about you when you create a user account (“**Account**”). We collect additional Personal Information about you as you complete your Account information, including your (and/or your practice's) address, phone number, and other information. Some aspects of the Services through your Account may be subject to fees. We collect Personal Information about your payment information, such as credit card information, when you sign up for these aspects of the Services. We may de-identify and anonymize Personal Information so it is no longer associated with any individual(s) in order to use it for other purposes, such as aggregating the data for statistical analysis.

Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and subsequent laws and regulations, when TherapyNotes receives certain health-related information, that information may be classified as “Protected Health Information” (**“PHI”**) under the law. HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how it may be used and disclosed. Notwithstanding any statements about the use of your Personal Information more generally in this Privacy Policy, TherapyNotes will only use and disclose PHI as authorized by you and/or your Service Provider(s) in accordance with applicable law.

To that end, before any PHI that you provide is shared with a Service Provider, you may be asked to affirmatively authorize TherapyNotes to do so. By providing such authorization, you are permitting TherapyNotes to release your Personal Information, including PHI, to those specified Service Provider(s) pursuant to HIPAA. Your authorization is entirely voluntary, but without authorization, TherapyNotes will not be able to share your information with selected Service Providers.

Information Use and Sharing
---------------------------

### Account Information

Some aspects of the Services require you to create a user account (“**Account**”) to access and use them. Your Account information is used to administer your account, provide, support, develop the Services, provide you with information and updates about the Services and your Account, and process any payments you may make through our third-party payment processing vendor.

### Content You Submit

Throughout your use of the Services, you may submit various forms of additional information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, audio, streams, or other materials. We will use the content you submit to administer, support, and provide the Services. We collect a range of Personal Information and usage statistics to maintain a high-quality user experience and deliver superior customer service. We request some information directly from you during registration. We gather other pieces of data indirectly from website traffic, your computer hardware and Internet connection, or your activities within the Services, communications, and usage.

### Information We Collect Automatically

Through your use of the Services, there are certain types of Non-Personal Information that we will automatically collect with no direct input from you.

#### Logs and Usage Data

Like most other website providers, when you access or use the Services, we may collect your IP address, user agent, device and browser information, pages visited, links clicked, search terms, and interactions with results. We may also collect your location information, either by you explicitly granting this permission to the Services or by deriving your approximate location based on other information, including your IP address. We use this information to provide you with the best possible experience with the Services, understand user interactions with the Services, and monitor, improve, support, and develop the Services.

#### Cookies and Other Similar Technologies

We utilize cookies and other similar technologies within the Services. You can find out more about the use of cookies and your choices about their use in the Cookie Policy below.

#### Information for Provider Profile Verification

If you create a Provider Profile as part of your Account, you may participate in the TherapyNotes Verification process. We may gather Third Party Information from third party resources as part of the Verification process, such as confirming your license information with a state licensing board or your practice address from your business registration. We may confirm any or all information in your Provider Profile with appropriate third-party resources. We use this information to provide your Provider Profile with a Badge.

#### Analytics and Advertiser Information

We may collect Third Party Information about you and your use of the Services from third-party analytics tools and advertisers.

Additional Uses of Your Information

We will share your information with vendors and other services providers who need to access this information to carry out the work they do for us. For example, we share your payment information with our payment processing vendor to process transactions on our behalf. Your information can also be shared with our cloud hosting and service providers who host our data and the Services and provide additional tools for security and management of the Services. By registering for or using our Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to anywhere where we, our contractors, or service providers maintain facilities for the use of your information as described in this Agreement.

### Compliance with Legal Requirements

We may access, preserve, and share information about you, without consent, to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we in good faith believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including, but not limited to, subpoenas), to comply with applicable laws, to protect the property and rights of TherapyNotes, you or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to pose a risk of being, or is illegal, unethical or legally actionable. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. You shall be responsible for any fees and expenses reasonably incurred by TherapyNotes in responding to a subpoena or other order.

We may also access, preserve, and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent, and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you, and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

### Change of Ownership or Corporate Organization

We may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers some or all information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of business, change in ownership control, or financing transaction.
