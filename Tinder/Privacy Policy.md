Security at Tinder
==================

A Secure and Trusted Place to Keep the Magic of Human Connection Alive!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tinder Security team’s mission is to build the best security organization in the world, ensuring our members have a private and secure place to keep the magic of human connection alive.

Because you entrust Tinder with your information, the security of our application and the privacy of your data is our top priority. Ensuring that we maintain a robust, transparent, and accountable security program is core to our commitment to you.

Internal Tinder Security Practices
----------------------------------

The security program at Tinder protects our organization and your data at every turn utilizing a combination of industry-leading security infrastructure, responsible data practices, as well as security and privacy best practices to stay ahead of the evolving number of threats facing internet services and infrastructure.

Our security program is focused on the following domains:

**Internal Information Security Program:** We strive to increase security and reduce risk within Tinder's digital environment. We proactively build secure access protocols and network architecture to enable systematic control of internal access to Tinder’s facilities, systems, and resources, using the least privilege paradigm. Tinder enforces the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) internally.

**Application / Infrastructure Security:** Security is engineered and integrated at all levels of our development lifecycle to help enable the creation of better, safer products, as well as to ensure secure design and engineering principles. Our applications and systems, including new features, code, and configuration changes pass through extensive security design reviews and assessments by our internal teams. Additionally, many of these applications and systems undergo routine independent and rigorous pen tests through reputable third-party security experts.

**Governance, Risk, and Compliance:** At Tinder, security awareness begins on day one and it is a continuous process thereafter. All employees undergo security and privacy training the moment they start as well as annually. Security is everyone’s responsibility at Tinder. We have implemented and enforced physical, operational, and technical controls, as well as enforced security policies and procedures to secure our systems and member data. In addition to performing extensive internal security risk assessments, we also perform in-depth reviews of the security posture of our third-party vendors.

**Red Team / Offensive Security:** Our internal Red Team identifies previously unknown security vulnerabilities in existing systems and workflows through offensive security testing. This group simulates real-world attacks on all areas of the company and prioritizes upleveling security posture to address areas of greatest risk. Our goal is to gain insight into potential exposures, and to continuously test to reduce the likelihood of a breach.

**Monitoring and Threat Management:** Access to our infrastructure and systems is continuously logged and monitored. Tinder's security monitoring, investigation, threat hunting, and response program ensures that we are alerted on as well as appropriately investigate, triage, and remediate security events.
