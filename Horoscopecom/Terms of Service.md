You acknowledge that some of the Services and Content are provided by third party suppliers and not by the Company.  
  
The Company reserves the right to take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the Website and your account, including without limitation, terminating your account, changing your password or requesting information to authorize transactions on your account.  
  
WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES AND DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS SECTION.  
  
    **5.2 Eligibility.** The Company does not permit the Services to be used by temporarily or indefinitely suspended users. In addition, the Company does not permit use of the Services by residents (a) of any jurisdiction that may prohibit our Services or (b) of any country that is prohibited by law, regulation, treaty or administrative act from entering into trade relations with the United States or its citizens. Such countries may include, without limitation, Afghanistan, Burma, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Serbia, Syria and Sudan. If you do not qualify, do not use the Services.

Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to terminate your account immediately (a) if we are unable to verify or authenticate your Registration Data or other information provided by you, (b) if we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, the Company, or all or some of our other users, or (c) if we believe you have (i) provided us with false or misleading Registration Data or other information, (ii) interfered with other users or the administration of the Services, or (iii) violated the Terms.  
  
  
  
**6\. FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS**  
  
    **6.1 Payment.** You agree to pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide the Company with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) or PayPal account ("**Payment Provider**") as a condition to signing up for any of the Personalized Services. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or PayPal account, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing the Company with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment information, you agree that the Company is authorized to immediately invoice your account for all fees and charges due and payable to the Company hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify the Company of any change in your billing address or the credit card or PayPal account used for payment hereunder. We reserve the right at any time to change our prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Company Properties or by e-mail delivery to you.  
  
    **6.2 Taxes.** The Company's fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. For purposes of this section, "**Sales Tax**" shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that the Company is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax. If any Services, or payments for any Personalized Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to the Company, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify the Company for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes.  
  
    **6.3 Disputes.** You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should be notified to the following address: [\[email protected\]](https://www.horoscope.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

You acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right (but have no obligation) to do one or all of the following, at our sole discretion: (a) evaluate Content before allowing it to be posted on the Website; (b) monitor Content; (c) alter, remove, reject, or refuse to post or allow to be posted, without notice to you, any Content, for any reason or for no reason whatsoever; provided, however, that we shall have no obligation or liability to you for failure to do so or for doing so in any particular manner; and/or (d) disclose any Content, and the circumstances surrounding its transmission, to any third party in order to operate the Website; to protect the Company and the Website's users and visitors; to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests; to enforce this Agreement; or for any other reason or purpose.
