1\. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE COLLECT IT?

When you use or access any of our web or mobile sites (known as "Platforms"), we may collect a variety of information about you and others, as described below. This information includes, but is not limited to, information about you which is in a form that permits us to identify you (your "personal data").

A. Personal Data About You That You Provide.

When you use or access any of our Platforms, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal data, for example: your name, username, email address, telephone number, current and previous mailing addresses, credit or debit card or PayPal account information, payment address, other financial account number, social security number or tax identification number, driver's license number or other government issued identification number (or a copy of your driver's license or other government issued identification card), date of birth, time of birth, birth location, gender, login, PIN, password, account preferences, and time zone. You may be asked for this information at certain times when interacting with our Platforms, such as when registering to be a user of any of our services, when making a purchase through any of our Platforms, or when filling out a form or survey or participating in a promotion through our Platforms.

B. Personal Data About You That We Collect Via Technology.

When you use or access any of our Platforms, we may also collect certain personal data through automated means, for example: your mobile phone number, unique device ID, device type, machine ID, advertising ID, geolocation information, computer and connection information, browser type, Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and date and time stamps for your visits. We also may collect any telephone number from which you contact us, or from which you place a call to another user through our calling feature on any of our Platforms. (If you call any user or other person directly – that is, not through the calling feature on any of our Platforms – your telephone number may be obtained by the person called.)

We may monitor or record your live telephone conversations with other users through the Platform for operational purposes, including for quality assurance purposes and in furtherance of making certain services available to you.

C. Information About You That We Collect From Others.

When you use or access any of our Platforms, we may also collect your name and email address from your friends who suggest to us that you may wish to use one of our Platforms. If we receive this personal data about you in this way, we will contact you to let you know that you have been recommended to us. If you do not respond to our outreach or you ask us to delete your personal data, we will do so.

When you use or access certain of our Platforms, we may also collect your name, address, phone number, and geolocation information from other third parties, such as identity verification vendors which we engage. We may also obtain information about you from our affiliates when you use their services (see Section 4.B below).

D. Information About Others That We Collect From You.

When you use or access any of our Platforms, you may decide to provide us with information about a third party, such as your friends' names and email addresses in connection with our "tell a friend" features.

E. Information Provided to Social Networking Sites.

Some of our Platforms may include the ability for you and other users to connect your profile on our Platform with Facebook or other Social Networking Sites or "SNS", such as via the "Connect to Facebook" functionality, whether you initially connect from our Platform to the SNS or in the other direction from the SNS to our Platform. We may receive or access information about you through the SNS when you choose to connect your Platform profile to any SNS, or to post or otherwise share information on any SNS to which you have connected your Platform profile. Note that any information that you or others post to an SNS will be accessible by any users of such SNS, subject to its terms of service and privacy policy.

F. Information Collected By Third-Party Integrated Technologies.

As with many operators of websites and mobile applications, we may incorporate third-party ads, offerings, and other technologies (such as plug-ins, pixels, and cookies) into our Platforms, enabling the third parties operating such ads, offerings, and other technologies to collect usage, demographic, and other information (including personal data) about you and your online activities through your use of our Platforms and across other websites and applications. Any information collected through such integrated ads, offerings, or other technologies on our Platforms is collected directly by those third parties for use and disclosure subject only to any applicable privacy policies of such third parties. For more information about our practices, please see our Cookies Policy linked in the footer of our Platforms.

G. Other Information That We Collect Via Technology.

When you use or access our Platforms, we also may collect certain information through automated means associated with your activities on our Platforms, including information about the way you interact with any of our Platforms or any content or advertising thereon, statistics regarding your page views and traffic to and from our Platforms, and the number of bytes transferred, hyperlinks clicked, and other actions you take on our Platforms. Each of our Platforms may also track information such as the URL that you visited before you come to the Platform and the URL to which you go next. As with most websites and other digital platforms, we also employ cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and similar technologies on our Platforms to collect and store certain information about visitors to our Platforms, to improve our services and advertising, and to help us remember you and your preferences when you revisit our Platforms. For more information about our practices in this area for a particular Platform, please see our Cookies Policy linked in the footer of such Platform.

H. Information in Your Inquiries and Posts.

We also collect information you send to us through our Platforms, or to other users through our Platforms, including information about you in correspondence, mail, and chats conducted through a Platform, and responses to our customer satisfaction surveys or customer service communications. We also collect information from content you post in online reviews, comments, forums, or blogs on our Platforms.

2\. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU?

Our primary purpose in collecting information about you in connection with your use of our Platforms is to provide you or connect you with products, services, information, and users that match your interests and preferences. However, we may use such information collected about you for a variety of commercial purposes. Without limitation, we may use such information to:

We may also use information about you that we collect in connection with your use of our Platforms for security, administrative, and legal purposes (including to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues).

We may also anonymize your information to remove personal data so that it cannot be associated with you or any other individual. We may analyze and use anonymized data to conduct research and develop new tools, features, products or services. We may also safely share anonymized data with third parties including our affiliates.

  

For users located in the USA (excluding the Commonwealth of Virginia and the States of Colorado and Connecticut), we may use your personal data for the purposes of training artificial intelligence (AI) models. For example, when you chat with psychics/advisors or other users on our Platforms, we may use these conversations to develop new products, services, and tools utilizing AI. We will not use personal data of users located in the EU, UK, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut or any jurisdiction in which such use is not permitted under applicable law for these purposes.

3\. HOW LONG DO WE MAINTAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

We will store your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which such personal data is processed. Please note, however, that we may retain and use your personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically and reasonably feasible to remove such information from our databases, which means that we may retain and use your personal data as necessary after you stop using our Platforms. Subject to the foregoing, we will endeavor to delete your personal data promptly upon your written request.

D. Third-Party Operators of Integrated Technologies.

As noted above, information about you collected via third-party ads, offerings, and other technologies integrated with any of our Platforms will be collected directly by (and thus disclosed to) the third parties providing or operating such ads, offerings, or other technologies. Any such information may be used and further disclosed subject only to any applicable privacy policies of such third parties. For more information about our practices in this area for a particular Platform, please see our Cookies Policy linked in the footer of our Platforms.

F. Co-Branded Service Providers.

We may enter into agreements with certain third-party businesses pursuant to which we provide such third party with a URL and a customer registration page co-branded with, or private labeled by, the third party, which distributes and promotes the URL to its customers. If you register on a website with a third party with which we have such a co-branded arrangement, we may provide information we have collected about you through our Platforms to such third party acting as such third party's service provider.

G. General Public.

We may share with the general public via our Platforms, or re-publish on a third-party website, any information that you post as a user of one of our Platforms, such as information in a listing, online review, comment, forum, or blog posting on any of our Platforms. This may include information that identifies you (by username or otherwise).

H. Third Parties Involved in Business Transactions.

We may share information about you collected through the Platforms to one or more third parties in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transition, or proceeding involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, such information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires any of our companies, businesses, or assets, that acquiring company may acquire the information about you collected by us through our Platforms. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all the terms of this Privacy Policy following such transaction.

I. Our Advisors.

We may also share information collected about you with our auditors, legal advisors, and similar third parties in connection with our receiving their professional services, subject to standard confidentiality obligations.

J. Law Enforcement.

We may disclose information about you to the government or to third parties under certain circumstances when legally obligated to do so, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity in connection with the Platforms, or to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, or that we believe may aid a law enforcement investigation. We reserve the right to release information collected through the Platforms to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.

K. Legal Processes.

We may share all types of information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing all types of information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.

L. Other Third Parties.

We may share information with other third parties that are not described above. When we do so we will endeavor to either aggregate or de-identify the information so that a third party would not be likely to link data to you, your computer, or your device. Aggregation means that we combine the information of numerous people together so that the data does not relate to any one person. De-identify means that we remove or change certain pieces of information that might be used to link data to a particular person.

We may also share any information with other third parties that are not described above if you give us consent to do so.

B. General.

By using any of our Platforms from outside the United States, you acknowledge that your personal data may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States and to our affiliates, partners, and service providers who are located around the world; and that your personal data will be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or elsewhere in the world where our servers are located. Where your personal data is transferred to a country that has not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of personal data when compared with the protections afforded under the GDPR, then we will ensure such transfer is governed by an agreement that incorporates standard contractual clauses approved for these purposes by the relevant body in the EU and/or UK as appropriate. This ensures your personal data remains protected.

  

If you are based in the EU or UK, we will only process your personal data for a purpose described in this Privacy Policy if (1) you have provided your consent (which can be withdrawn at any time), (2) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you, (3) we are required by law, (4) processing is required to protect your vital interests or those of another person, or (5) the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate commercial interests (except where such interests are overridden by your rights and interests). Where we are processing your personal data on the basis that it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate commercial interests, the relevant interest will generally be the operation of the Platform and the provision of services to you via the Platform. We may also process your personal data when it is in our legitimate interests in further developing and improving the Services, analysing traffic to better serve all Service users, analysing the likes and dislikes of our users, and to help us to provide a more stable, consistent, and secure user experience.

C. Rights Under the GDPR.

If you are based in the EU or UK, in certain circumstances you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data that we hold about you – specifically:

1. Request access to your personal data. You may have the right to request access to any personal data we hold about you as well as related information, including the purposes for processing the personal data, the recipients, or categories of recipients with whom the personal data has been shared, where possible, the period for which the personal data will be stored, the source of the personal data, and the existence of any automated decision making.

2. Request correction of your personal data. You may have the right to obtain without undue delay the rectification of any inaccurate personal data we hold about you.

3. Request erasure of your personal data. You may have the right to request that personal data held about you be deleted.

4. Request restriction of processing your personal data. You may have the right to prevent or restrict processing of your personal data.

5. Request transfer of your personal data. You may have the right to request transfer of your personal data directly to a third party where this is technically feasible.

Also, where you believe that we have not complied with our obligation under this Privacy Policy or European data protection law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU or UK Data Protection Authority.

You can exercise any of these rights by calling us at (402) 509-8598 or by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.horoscope.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

D. Restrictions on Use of Your Personal Data to Promote Third-Party Products and Services.

If you are based in the EU or UK, we will only send you direct marketing communications related to unaffiliated third party products and services if you have given your consent to receiving such marketing. We will generally ask for your consent to receive such marketing when you first provide your personal data.

You can choose to stop receiving any direct marketing communications from us or our affiliates at any time simply by following the "Unsubscribe" or "Manage Email Preferences" link at the bottom of any promotional email, or by logging into your profile on the applicable Platform and making changes in your account settings. Please note that you may not opt out of receiving non-promotional emails regarding your account or your transactions with us.

14\. WHAT ARE THE TERMS REGARDING ANY FUTURE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, with any such changes to be effective prospectively. Please visit this web page periodically so that you will be apprised of any such changes. Your continued use of any of our Platforms after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.

15\. WHAT LAW GOVERNS ANY DISPUTES REGARDING THIS PRIVACY POLICY?

You agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the law of the State of California, without reference to the choice of law or conflicts of law principles thereof, and will be subject to the terms and limitations of the User Agreement or any other agreement we may have with you.

If any provision of this Privacy Policy is judged to be illegal, void, or unenforceable due to applicable law or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction it shall be deemed deleted and the continuation in full force and effect of the remainder of the provisions will not be prejudiced.

If you enter into a contract with us that requires, or contemplates, collecting, using, sharing, or securing information about you in a manner that is different than that which is described in this Privacy Policy, the terms of that contract will apply.
