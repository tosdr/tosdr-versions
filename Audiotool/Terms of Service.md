### 2 Intellectual Property

Any and all music, tracks, samples, pictures, graphic, comments, and other content, data or information that User uploads, stores or submits to AUDIOTOOL (hereinafter „Content“) are generated by the User, not by AUDIOTOOL.

User acknowledges that Content uploaded or transmitted through AUDIOTOOL may be protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other intellectual property rights and laws. User also acknowledges that copying tracks or samples of someone else requires the author's prior permission. User must not upload, send, transmit or otherwise make available any Content in which User does not have the appropriate rights to do so. Unauthorized copying, distribution, modification, public performance or other unauthorized use of copyrighted works by User may constitute an infringement of the copyright holder's rights and may result in civil litigation and criminal prosecution.

### 3 Information and Communication

3.2 From time to time AUDIOTOOL will send User important information concerning this agreement. AUDIOTOOL will generally send this information by email to the email address User provides. It is therefore in the responsibility of User to keep his/her email address up to date at all times and to check Users‘ email accounts regularly.

### 4 Warranties And Liabilities

User represents and warrants to AUDIOTOOL that:

1. a.i) Users‘ Content shall be true, accurate, complete and not misleading.

User acknowledges and agrees that AUDIOTOOL cannot and does not generally review the Content created and uploaded on AUDIOTOOL and therefore assumes no responsibility to monitor the Website for inappropriate Content.

### 5 Usage

5.1 AUDIOTOOL undertakes every effort to avoid any restrictions, impairments, interrupts to connections or other curtailments of use of the services, so far as this is technically possible. Given the current state of communication technology, AUDIOTOOL cannot totally rule out the possibility of such curtailments occurring. This applies especially to Content and transmission media which are beyond AUDIOTOOL's control. In the event of curtailments resulting from AUDIOTOOL's actions, AUDIOTOOL's liability shall be as set out in Item 9 of these terms and conditions.

5.2 Temporary usage restrictions are necessary in order to maintain and further develop AUDIOTOOL services. AUDIOTOOL always endeavours to keep such restrictions reasonable and as low as possible. When usage will be restricted or interrupted because of maintenance or development work, AUDIOTOOL will give User as much advance notice as possible - by email or other electronic means (e.g. an announcement on the web pages).

5.3 To protect our systems and third parties against harmful programs and content such as viruses, Trojan horses and spam, AUDIOTOOL may implement technical protective measures. This includes the use of filter systems, where this is appropriate, particularly for the protection of telecommunication and data processing systems.

### 6 Release of content, copyright, and licences

6.1 AUDIOTOOL offers a platform for the publication of Users‘ Content. For each item of content User can at the time of publication and thereafter define the extent to which it should be available to other Users. To this end AUDIOTOOL offers a range of different release options that AUDIOTOOL considers as reasonable and practicable.

6.2 AUDIOTOOL lays no claim to usage or exploitation rights in relation to Users‘ Content. However, AUDIOTOOL may incorporate Content that User has released to an unlimited group of Users into web content maintained by AUDIOTOOL, and also partner websites, if AUDIOTOOL believes that this Content is of interest to a larger group of Users. AUDIOTOOL will always ask User for his/ her prior approval.

6.3 AUDIOTOOL applies the license policy according to the established creative commons. Given that the User holds all required rights, when uploading or saving Content he/ she is requested to select the scope of further usage through any third party by selecting the relevant copyright license under creative commons provided by AUDIOTOOL.

6.4 Given that User holds all required rights, at some stage within the Users‘ right management on audiotool.com User may want to change a license on Content he/she already uploaded and published. If User decides to further tighten copyrights on Content he/she already published, User agrees that this shall only apply to the use of the respective Content in future after the date of change in the license. A retrospective limitation of a given copyright is by definition not implementable.

6.5 User acknowledges that the tightest copyright license given by the author, will always be the minimum requirement on a succeeding license that User would have to apply in order to further license his /her Content.
