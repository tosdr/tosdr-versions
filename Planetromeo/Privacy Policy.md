Privacy and cookie statement ROMEO
==================================

Updated 6 April 2021.

Your privacy and the protection of your personal data is of great importance to ROMEO B.V. (hereinafter: ROMEO). During the processing of your personal data both offline and online, via the ROMEO website ([www.romeo.com](http://www.romeo.com/)) and the ROMEO app, ROMEO works in accordance with the requirements for the processing of personal data as laid down in the European privacy legislation (General Data Protection Regulation). This means ROMEO:

* **Clearly specifies the purposes** before ROMEO processes personal data, by using this privacy and cookie statement
* **Limits the collection of personal data** to only the personal data needed for legitimate purposes
* First **asks for explicit permission** to process your personal data in cases where your permission is required
* Takes **appropriate security measures** to protect your personal data and ROMEO demands the same from parties who process personal data on behalf of ROMEO
* **Respects your right** to access, correct or delete your personal data held by ROMEO

### For what purposes does ROMEO use your personal data?

ROMEO processes your personal data for the following purposes:

* To create an account and a profile
* To find friends, dates and relationships, and participate in the ROMEO online community, when logged in
* To upgrade to a PLUS subscription
* To identify and prevent fraud
* To contact you, when you ask us to, or to provide you with support
* To send notifications
* To send (personalized) messages within your account
* To send automated service e-mails
* To handle job applications

### What kind of personal data is processed ROMEO?

For the purposes mentioned above ROMEO may process the following (not limited) categories of personal data:

* Account data (such as e-mail address and password)
* Profile data (such as (profile) name, date of birth, location, sexual orientation and physical stats)
* Media data (such as profile picture, your comments and tags)
* Interaction data (such as travel destination, club membership(s), content of messages and profile visits)
* Device data (such as IP address of last login, app/browser version and default language)
* Other data (such as timestamp of last access of specific features, PLUS status and user’s currency)

ROMEO needs this personal data in order to provide you with its services and to perform the contract that is concluded between you and ROMEO to this end. ROMEO will only send you notifications with your permission. When you do not wish to receive notifications, you can always revoke your consent by changing the settings in your account. Moreover, ROMEO has a legitimate interest in identifying and preventing fraud and sending you automated service e-mails.

### Processing of special categories of personal data

When you use the services by ROMEO, ROMEO will process special categories of personal data, such as your sexual orientation, from you. ROMEO only processes this sensitive personal data because you choose to make this personal data public or on the basis of your explicit consent.

### How long does ROMEO store your personal data?

In general ROMEO stores your personal data until your account is deleted. You can delete your account yourself at anytime. In case you haven’t logged into your account for 12 months, ROMEO will delete your account for you. After your account has been deleted, your personal data will remain in a back-up for another 28 days. After these 28 days, your personal data is deleted permanently, except for the following personal data:

* Direct interaction with other users (e.g. messages) will be deleted 24 hours after the deletion of your account. However, be aware that your message(s) to another user will stay visible for the user who received a message from you, and actively saved it in his account, until he deletes the message(s) (or his account) himself;
* IP and email addresses are retained for an additional 6 months (to provide support, for analytical reasons and to support a legal process or request by law enforcement authorities);
* Personal data used to identify and prevent fraud on our platform is stored until ROMEO is sure you are not misusing its services;
* In case you have had contact with ROMEO’s customer support: this data will be stored up to 6 months after your last contact with ROMEO. This way ROMEO can support you in case you have any following questions or needs for support and train the customer service of ROMEO;

In addition personal data processed by us to handle your job application will be stored for a maximum of 6 weeks after the position has been filled, and with your consent for a further year. This enables us to contact you in the event the position becomes vacant again or to offer you a job in the future.

Finally personal data ROMEO processes on the basis of your consent will be stored until you withdraw your consent.

### _ROMEO app_

You can also use the services by ROMEO via the ROMEO app. In order to do so, you need to download the ROMEO app first. You can do this via the App Store or via Google Play. ROMEO has no influence on which personal data is processed by the provider ([Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/) and [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)) and for what purpose they use your personal data. ROMEO recommends that you read the relevant privacy statement of the provider in question.
