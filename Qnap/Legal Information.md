If you choose to use any such third-party applications or services, we may facilitate sharing of your information with your consent. However, we do not control the applications or services of those third parties or how they use your information, and your use of such applications and services is not governed by our privacy policy. Please review the terms and the privacy policies of those third parties before using their applications or services.

We will display your personal data and account activity in your profile page and elsewhere on our service portals according to the preferences you set in your account.

In your profile page, we will also display your device information as well as provide the network connection information for the devices to the applications that connect to your devices.

How long do we keep your personal data?
---------------------------------------

We keep your personal data for no longer than reasonably necessary for the given purpose for which your data is processed. If you will provide us, or have provided us, consent for us to process your data, we will process your data for no longer than your consent is effective. Notwithstanding the above, we may retain your personal data as required by applicable laws and regulations, as necessary to assist with any government and judicial investigations, to initiate or defend legal claims or for the purpose of civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings. If none of the above grounds for us to keep your data apply, we will delete and dispose of your data in a secure manner according to our privacy policy.

Privacy of data subjects under the age of 16
--------------------------------------------

Our products and services are not targeted to persons under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from persons under the age of 16. Please note that if you are under the age of 16, you should not buy or use our products or services, and we will not be liable for any losses or damages incurred by the unauthorized disclosure or processing of personal data under the age of 16.

Your rights and your personal data
----------------------------------

### Unless subject to an exemption under applicable privacy laws, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data:

* The right to request a copy of your personal data which we hold about you.
* The right to request that we correct any personal data that is found to be inaccurate or out of date.
* The right to request that we erase your personal data where it is no longer necessary for us to retain such data, except we are not obliged to do so if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
* The right to withdraw your consent to the processing at any time, where we rely on your consent to process your data. This includes cases where you wish to opt out of marketing communications that you receive from us.
* The right to request that we provide you with your data and, where possible, to transmit that data directly to another data controller, where the processing is based on your consent or is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and, in either case, we process the data by automated means.
* The right to restrict our processing of your personal data where you believe such data to be inaccurate, or our processing is unlawful; or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it.
* The right to object to us using your personal data, where the legal justification for our processing of your personal data is our legitimate interest. We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
* The right to lodge a complaint regarding our processing of your data, with the competent authority where you reside or in which your data is processed.

If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, please do so through this webpage: [www.qnap.com/sarf](http://www.qnap.com/sarf).

After receiving your request, we will evaluate your request and inform you how we intend to proceed with your request. Under certain circumstances, in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations, we may withhold access to your data, or decline to modify, erase, port, or restrict the processing of your data.

Please be advised that if you exercise the rights to erase data, restrict or object to our processing, or to withdraw your consent, we may not be able to continue providing our services to you if the necessary data is missing for processing.

Transfer, storage, and processing of data abroad
------------------------------------------------

As noted in the "Sharing your personal data" section of this Notice, as a globally operating company, we may share your information with our affiliate companies or third parties. Please refer to the "Sharing your personal data" section of this Notice for the recipients of your data and the reasons for our provision of your data to them. Where such entities are located in other countries and jurisdictions, we will therefore be transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area. In making such data transfers, we make sure to protect your personal data by applying the level of security required by applicable privacy laws. Where we transfer your data to a country or jurisdiction that cannot guarantee the required level of protection as required by applicable privacy laws, we have enhanced our IT security measures and have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the transferee to require security obligations on the transferee, both of which are intended to increase the protection of your personal data. SCCs are one of a number of "appropriate safeguards" under the applicable privacy laws that enable the transfer of personal data concerning data subjects within the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that have not been designated by the European Commission as possessing an adequate level of data protection. You may request a copy of such SCCs from us, or inquire about transfers of your information, by providing your request to the contact window set forth in the "Whom should I contact?" section.

Further processing
------------------

If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose not covered by this Notice, then we will provide you with a new notice explaining this new use prior to commencing such further processing for a new purpose. This new notice sets out the relevant new purpose and processing conditions. In such a case, we will find a lawful basis for further processing, and whenever necessary, we will seek your prior written consent to such further processing.

Security
--------

We protect your data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access. Some of the safeguards we use are data pseudonymization, data encryption, firewalls, and data access authorization controls. We take our data security very seriously. Therefore the security mechanisms used to protect your data are checked and updated regularly to provide effective protection against abuse.

The servers through which we collect your information are usually encoded using the encryption module of your browser, and are certified by renowned institutions for international encryption technique. If necessary, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect your personal information. Moreover, we have put in place additional and comprehensive state-of-the-art security measures every time your data are accessed through the internet. Firewalls prevent unauthorized access. Diverse encryption and identification layers protect your data from intrusion or disclosure to third parties during data transfer. Furthermore, we internally use sophisticated encoding methods in order to prevent decoding by unauthorized persons. Moreover, an electronic identifier is generated during data transfer to safeguard your information.

For your confidentiality and security, we use IDs and passwords to secure your personal information. It is important for you to protect your ID, password, or any personal information. Do not disclose your personal information, especially your password, to anyone. When you are finished using our services, please do not forget to log out from your account. If you share a computer, whether in a public or private setting, be sure to sign off and close your browsers when finished using a shared computer.

If you believe that the security of your data has been compromised, or if you would like more information on the measures we use to protect your data, you can contact us using the channels set forth in the "Whom should I contact?" section of this Notice.

What are your choices?
----------------------

You have the choice to allow us to collect and process your data. The collection and processing of your personal data is neither a statutory nor a contractual requirement, although as noted above, we will be unable to provide you with certain services without the necessary data.

If you are dealing with us online, note that most browsers will inform you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to receive notifications whenever you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies. Additionally, you can disable or delete the data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, on your browser or on the website of its manufacturer.

You can always choose not to provide us with your data. In case we may need such data to process your requests, we will inform you of our constraints.

To the extent that you have consented to our processing of your data, you can choose to discontinue our processing at any time.

You can choose to add or update data that you have provided us with.

You can choose to erase your data, or choose to restrict our processing of your data instead.

You can choose to port your data to a third party under the conditions stated above.

You can choose to object to our processing of your data.

You can inform us of your choices or request on any data processing aspect listed above using the channels set forth in the "Whom should I contact?" section of this Notice.

In summary, what we are allowed to do with your data—with limited exceptions under applicable privacy laws—is up to you. However, in the event that you choose not to let us further process your data, your choice may affect the delivery of our obligations or services to you. In this case, we will inform you of our constraints.
