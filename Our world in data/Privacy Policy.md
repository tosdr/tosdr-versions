### External websites[](#external-websites)

#### Links on our website to and from third parties[](#links-on-our-website-to-and-from-third-parties)

Our websites contain links to and from various third party sites. If you follow a link to any of these external sites, please note that these sites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these third party sites.

#### Third parties embedding our interactive charts on their website[](#third-parties-embedding-our-interactive-charts-on-their-website)

When you embed one of our interactive charts on your site, analytics data is sent to the same analytics providers we use on [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/). This helps us understand our global reach and keep our editorial line as clear and relevant as possible.

We primarily use Google Analytics at the moment to make sense of user cohorts as a whole, although we might use other providers from time to time to answer different questions. These providers set cookies, which we refer to on this page.

By embedding our charts, your readers also receive those cookies and as such should be prompted for consent. We have no interest in tracking our (or your) readers individually. When we need specific and individual input, [we ask for it directly and publicly](https://ourworldindata.org/help-us-improve-our-world-in-data).

### Disclosing your data[](#disclosing-your-data)

We may share your personal data with third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our site terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our site, our users, and others.

Where your data is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.

### Retaining your data[](#retaining-your-data)

We will only retain your data for as long as we need it to fulfil our purposes, including any relating to legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

### Your rights[](#your-rights)

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

* Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of your personal data and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
* Request correction of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate personal information we hold about you.
* Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your personal data under certain circumstances, for example, if you consider that there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
* Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
* Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
* Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.

Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request it may not be possible for us to do what you have asked, for example, where there is a statutory or contractual requirement for us to process your personal data and it would not be possible to fulfil our legal obligations if we were to stop. Further information on your rights is available from the [Information Commissioner’s Office](https://ico.org.uk/) (ICO).

If you want to exercise any of the rights described above or are dissatisfied with the way we have used your information, you should contact us at [info@ourworldindata.org](mailto:info@ourworldindata.org). We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.

If you remain dissatisfied, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the ICO at [https://ico.org.uk/concerns/](https://ico.org.uk/concerns/).
