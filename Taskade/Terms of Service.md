Terms of Service
================

Acceptance of the Terms of Service
----------------------------------

Welcome to **Taskade!** (a.k.a. “**we**” or “**us**” or the “**Company**”). We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these “**Terms of Service** ”) apply to your use of [www.taskade.com](https://www.taskade.com/), including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Taskade.com (the “**Website** ”). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review here: [Privacy Policy](https://www.taskade.com/privacy).

We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Taskade, because **by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.**

Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we’ll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.taskade.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We’ll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.

Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website
-----------------------------------------------

Taskade is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way. Of course, this document is public on Taskade, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version. **Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes**

Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy
-------------------------------------------

We are working hard on improving Taskade, but we can’t guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below).

To access certain features of the Website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Taskade in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. “kjSA&\*-\_Y@#Ba”) and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.

It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.

We use SSL encrypted browsing for all logged-in users, but we cannot guarantee that all use will be secure. We also do not guarantee that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data according to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.taskade.com/privacy).

Law and Copyright Infringement
------------------------------

We do not undertake to review all material before it is posted on the Website, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by any user or third party. In the unlikely event we receive a disclosure request from an authorized party, we reserve the right to disclose user identities when required to do so by the law, including in response to a law enforcement request supported by a valid court order. You waive and hold harmless the Company from any claims resulting from any action taken by the Company during or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either the Company or law enforcement authorities.

If you believe that any User Content violate your copyright, please follow the procedure set forth by article 512(c) of the DMCA and provide us a written takedown notice including the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
    
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
    
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.
    
4. Information reasonably sufficient for us to contact you, such as email, address, telephone number.
    
5. A statement that you a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
    
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitations of Liability and Indemnification.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Your use of Taskade is at your sole risk. The service is provided “as is” and “as available”.** We disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We are not liable for damages, direct or consequential, resulting from your use of the Website, and you agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, losses, liability costs and expenses arising from your violation of any third-party’s rights. You acknowledge that you have only a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable license to use the Website. Because the Website is not error or bug free, you agree that you will use it carefully and avoid using it ways which might result in any loss of your or any third party’s property or information.

Publicity Rights
----------------

(a) The Owner grants Taskade the right to include the Owner's organization as a customer in Product promotional material.

(b) The Owner can deny Taskade this right by submitting a written request via email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.taskade.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), requesting to be excluded from Product promotional material.

(c) Should the Owner come to be or already be included in Product promotional material as a result of any prior purchases where the Owner did not request exclusion from Product promotional material, the Owner can, at any point in time, submit a written request via email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.taskade.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to have Taskade remove the Owner's organization name from Product promotional material. Upon receipt of such request, Taskade will remove any reference to the organization from such promotional material within 30 days and make no further reference to it.

Geographic Restrictions
-----------------------

For now, we provide this Website for use only by persons located in the United States. We make no claims that the Website or any of its content is accessible, appropriate or legal outside of the United States. If you access the Website from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

Paid Accounts
-------------

You can upgrade to access premium features by converting your account into a "Paid Account." We'll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation.

Many of Taskade's Premium Plans include a specified number of collaborators and workspace member seats bundled into the price, so you will be billed a fixed amount each billing cycle.

For per-seat plans, your account balance will be automatically updated if you add or remove collaborators or workspace member seats. In such cases, automatic billing will apply for the additional seats. You are responsible for all applicable taxes, and we will charge tax when required by law.

30-Day Money-Back Guarantee
---------------------------

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with our services and cancel your Paid Account within 30 days of upgrading, you're eligible for a full refund.

You may cancel your Paid Account at any time after the initial 30-day period, but no refunds will be issued. Your Paid Account will remain active until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms.

Termination of Accounts
-----------------------

You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you're not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others' use of the Services.

Governing Law and Jursidiction
------------------------------

These Terms of Service and any dispute or claim arising out of, or related to them, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.

Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Service or the Website shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of New York.

Waiver and Severability
-----------------------

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Taskade and govern your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.

Modification of the Terms
-------------------------

We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
