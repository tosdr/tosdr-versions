-----------------------

S.C. Evercoder Software S.R.L. owns and provides various websites (the **“Websites”**), services, and software (such as moqups.com) that facilitate online mockups or other types of content creation and sharing, collectively, the **“Services”**.

BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES IN WHOLE OR IN PART YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS SET FORTH BELOW (THE **“TERMS OF SERVICE”**). IF YOU REPRESENT A COMPANY, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE ON BEHALF OF YOUR COMPANY, AND BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES IN WHOLE IN OR IN PART YOU AGREE ON BEHALF OF YOU AND YOUR COMPANY TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

In these Terms of Service, we may refer to S.C. Evercoder Software S.R.L. as **“Evercoder”**, **“us”**, or **“we”**, and “you” shall refer to you and, where applicable, to your company. Any and all use of the Services is subject to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to be subject to these Terms of Service, do not use the Services. BY CONTINUING TO USE THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

EVERCODER RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, TO CHANGE, MODIFY, UPDATE, ADD, OR REMOVE PORTIONS OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. PLEASE CHECK THESE TERMS OF SERVICE PERIODICALLY FOR CHANGES. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES AFTER THE POSTING OF ANY CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE WILL SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE CHANGES. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at [https://moqups.com/terms/](https://moqups.com/terms/)

Any new features that augment or enhance the current Services, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. These Terms of Service cover your use of the Services, and you agree that these Terms of Service apply to your use of the Services. **“Users”** or **Accounts** shall refer to any and all individuals or organizations using the Services.

BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ALSO CONSENT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE EVERCODER PRIVACY POLICY. You can review the most current version of the **Privacy Policy** at any time at [https://moqups.com/privacy/](https://moqups.com/privacy/)

2\. Account registration
------------------------

Use of the Services is restricted to users at least 13 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, you must use an account created by a parent or guardian, and you must have the explicit permission of a parent or guardian to use the Services.

If you are under the age of 18, you must have the explicit permission of a parent or guardian to sign up for any paid services on the Services.

You must register to access and use certain parts of the Services.

One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.

When you enter or try to use a part of the Services that requires registration, you will be prompted to create an account (a “User Account”) or log into your existing User Account. You understand that if you are so prompted you will not be able to continue using that portion of the Services without having a User Account.

If you are registering on behalf of a company, by registering you agree that you have the requisite authority to register on behalf of such company. You agree that any information you provide when registering for the Services, and at any time thereafter is true, accurate and complete and that, where applicable, you will update all such information as necessary to maintain its truth, accuracy and completeness. FAILURE TO DO SO SHALL CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. You further agree that any credit card information or PayPal Account Information you provide through the Services is valid and that you have authority to authorize payments from such credit card or PayPal Account. You further agree that you will use the Services only for the purposes advertised on the Evercoder websites and/or set forth herein.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and will be solely liable for all actions taken via your account, whether or not made with your knowledge or authority. Evercoder cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

3\. Use of the Services
-----------------------

Evercoder grants to you a non-exclusive license to access and use the Services in accordance with these Terms of Service. You agree not to use, copy, modify, reformat, rent, lease, lend, frame, create derivative works, publicly display, download, store, reproduce, transmit, provide links to, republish, upload, post, reprocess, make commercial use of, or distribute the Services, in whole or in part.

Evercoder shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to make its Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (a) planned downtime, or (b) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems, or Internet service provider failures or delays.

Evercoder shall provide you with basic online support for the Services at no additional charge, and/or upgraded support if purchased separately, and shall provide the Services only in accordance with applicable laws and government regulations.

4\. Pricing and Payment Terms
-----------------------------

1. **Subscription Fees:** You understand that certain services require monthly and/or annual payments (“Subscription Fee”) to continue to use such services. These fees are posted and updated periodically on the Evercoder’s Moqups web site (moqups.com).
2. **Payment:** Unless otherwise stated, all fees are in U.S. Dollars. A valid credit card or a PayPal payment validation is required for Subscription Fees and Transaction Fees. Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number. An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately be billed to you. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. Downgrading your plan will NOT cause any data/content loss but some features may become unavailable.
3. **General:** You agree to pay all charges that are applicable to you as set forth on the Evercoder website and/or in these Terms of Service. You agree that the address and email address you provide in your account settings are valid addresses and that Evercoder may contact you at such addresses or through other electronic or facsimile communications. Evercoder reserves the right, at any time and at its discretion, to change any fees and any other pricing terms. Any changes shall be posted on the Evercoder website and will be effective after such posting. Evercoder reserves the right but has no obligation to notify you through the contact information you provide of any such changes.
4. **Auto-Renewal:** We will automatically bill your credit card on each periodic renewal subscription term, from the date of your first purchase until you cancel, either by downgrading to a free plan, or by deleting your account. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it’s cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, including through a declined credit card transaction, Evercoder reserves the right to suspend your account or reduce your storage to free space levels.
5. **Refunds:** Any fees paid to Evercoder by you pursuant to these Terms of Service are nonrefundable. The Services are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. Any exception to this policy is at the sole discretion of Evercoder.
6. **Nonpayment:** If, for whatever reason, your payment method fails, and the payment does not go through, Evercoder reserves the right to suspend your access to the Services. If you fail to pay the applicable charge within five (5) days of the date of suspension, or to otherwise negotiate a payment plan for all amounts then due, Evercoder reserves the right to cancel your account. In the event Evercoder cancels your account for non-payment, all amounts due and unpaid from you to Evercoder for use of the Services shall become immediately due and payable. In the event of non-payment and the exhaustion of the procedures set forth in this section, Evercoder reserves the right to seek payment using any remedies allowed to it by law. Evercoder shall have the right to recoup all payments due to it under this agreement as set forth in this agreement.
7. **Disputes:** If you wish to dispute any charge invoiced to you by Evercoder, you agree to submit the disputed charge to us no later than five (5) business days after the disputed charge is posted to your account. You are responsible for reviewing any charges made to your account. You may submit a disputed charge by contacting us through the Evercoder website, email, telephone, or mail.
8. **Cancellation:** You may downgrade or cancel your paid subscription at any time. If you do, we’ll treat your information responsibly. You can find instructions in our [FAQ](https://moqups.com/faq/) on how to downgrade your account

This does not apply to work you may submit, create, develop, collaborate on, or otherwise work on in connection with using the Services, and you will retain all rights in and to any work to the extent it is original work created by you, subject to Section 6 “Content Ownership and Conduct”, below.

15. employ automated systems (including crawlers, spiders, robots, etc) that send more requests to Evercoder’s servers than possible to do by a human using a conventional web-browser in the same amount of time.
