    Credit information is personal information that is about credit that has been provided to you or that you have applied for. This includes credit for personal purposes and credit in connection with a business. It can also cover information about you as a guarantor of a loan or as an insured party under a credit related insurance policy.

    We collect credit information directly from you or your representative when you apply for a credit related product or service, like a credit card. We also collect credit information about you from third parties, including credit reporting bodies (such as Equifax) or other credit providers (such as another bank).
    
    The types of credit information we collect and handle are set out below.
    
    **Identification information**
    
    This includes your name (including any aliases), gender, date of birth, driver licence number, current and most recent past addresses, as well as current and most recent past employers.

    When you apply to us for credit or propose to be a guarantor, we need to know if you’re able to meet repayments under your agreement with us. We also want to avoid giving you further credit if this would put you in financial difficulty.
    
    We use credit information to:

    * help us collect overdue payments
    * share information with credit reporting bodies, where the law permits us to do so.
    
    ### How do we hold credit information?
    
    We keep your credit information with your other information. In some cases, we may need to share some of your information with organisations outside Australia (see _Collection, use & sharing_, Section 2c).

    It is important that we hold accurate credit information about you. To access or correct your credit information, please contact us (see _We’re here to help_, Section 6a).

* ### Credit reporting bodies
    
    If you apply for credit or offer to act as a guarantor, we may collect or share your information with a credit reporting body. This information is used to determine your eligibility for credit.
    
    Credit reporting bodies include this information in their reports to help other credit providers to assess your credit worthiness (such as when you apply for a credit card or a loan). 
    
    We can also ask credit reporting bodies to give us your overall credit score and may use credit information from credit reporting bodies together with other information to arrive at our own assessment of your ability to manage credit.
    
    **Direct marketing:** Credit providers like us can ask credit reporting bodies to use your credit information to pre-screen you for direct marketing purposes. You can contact the credit reporting bodies if you want to stop your credit information being used for this purpose.  
    
    **Preventing identity fraud:** If you think you have been, or could be, a victim of fraud you can ask the credit reporting body not to use or give anyone your credit information.
    
    We collect from, and share information with, the following credit reporting bodies. For more information about how they handle credit reporting information they hold about you, or about direct marketing or identity fraud, you can contact them below.

    ### Additional rights for individuals located in the European Economic Area and United Kingdom
    
    The European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have local data protection laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), which give more rights to individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA)  and the UK and more obligations to organisations holding their personal information. 
    
    If you are a customer of our UK branch or our bank in Netherlands, that organisation will be a “controller” of your personal information, which means it is responsible for compliance with the GDPR or UK GDPR as applicable. 
    
    In this Appendix, “personal information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
    
    Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, personal information must be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner. This means we must provide you with more information about how we collect, use, share and store your personal information and information about your rights in data protection law.  We have set out below this information, which is in addition to certain other information provided in the Group Privacy Statement above.
    
    If you are located in the UK or EEA and have an enquiry relating to your data protection rights, please contact [myprivacyrequest@cba.com.au](mailto:myprivacyrequest@cba.com.au "Follow link").
    
    ### What personal information do we collect?
    
    For details of what personal information we collect, please refer to Section 2 (_Collection, use and sharing_) above. 
    
    If we require certain information for our contract with you or because it is legally required and you do not provide this to us, we may not be able to offer you products or services, or perform our contract with you. 
    
    **Special categories of personal information** 
    
    Personal information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, biometric data (for example your fingerprints), or data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation is subject to additional requirements.  
    
    If we process this personal information about you, we will only process this with your consent or where otherwise lawfully permitted.
    
    **How long we keep your personal information**
    
    We will keep your personal information while you are a customer. We keep your personal information for only as long as we need it for the relevant purpose.
    
    We generally keep your personal information for up to 7 years after you stop being a customer but we may keep your personal information for longer for the following purposes:
    
    * To fulfil legal or regulatory obligations
    * For internal research and analytics 
    * To respond to a question or complaint
    
    ### How we use your personal information
    
    We can collect and use your personal information for the purposes noted above in Section 2 (_Collection, use and sharing)_.  We must have a valid lawful ground to process your personal information, which may be one of the following lawful grounds: 
    
    * Contract: We need to process your personal information in order to fulfil a contract you have with us, or because you have asked us to take specific steps before entering into a contract.
    * Legal or regulatory obligations: We need to process your personal information for us to comply with applicable law or regulations (not including contractual obligations).
    * Legitimate interests: We need to process your personal information for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party unless there is a good reason to protect your personal information which overrides these legitimate interests.  
        
    * Consent: We may (but usually do not) need your consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.
    

**The purposes for which we use your personal information, lawful grounds we may rely upon are as follows:**

**Profiling and automated decision making**

We may use systems to make automated decisions (including profiling) based on personal information we have collected from you or obtained from other sources such as credit reporting bodies. These systems can evaluate your personal circumstances and other factors to predict risk or outcomes.

Our credit approval process relies on automated analysis of personal information provided by you in the application process, alongside that received from credit referencing agencies and fraud prevention agencies, to make the following decisions:

* eligibility – whether it is appropriate to offer you credit or a loan;
* affordability – the maximum value of the credit or loan (ie, the credit limit); and
* the term of the credit or loan.

These automated decisions can affect the products or services we offer you.  For example, we may decide not to offer all or some our products or services to you, or we may decide how much to charge you, based on credit history and other financial information about you.

You have certain rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling, which are set out below.  

**Sending  information outside the UK/EEA**

Recipients of your personal information may be located outside the UK or EEA as described in Section 2 (_Collection, use & sharing_). 

Where we transfer your personal information outside the UK or the EEA, we will ensure that it is transferred in a manner consistent with legal requirements applicable to the information, for example:

* we may put in place “standards contractual clauses” approved by the European Commission with the recipient, which requires them to protect your personal information; or
* the country to which we send the personal information may be approved by the European Commission or UK; or
* applicable law may permit us to transfer outside the UK or EEA in other ways, such as to perform a contract with you.

Please contact us if you would like more information about the appropriate safeguards, including a sample copy of the standard contractual clauses, relevant to the transfer of personal information. 

**Your rights**  

You have a number of rights in relation to the personal information that we hold about you, although please note that in some cases, exceptions apply to the exercise of these rights and so you may not be able to exercise them in all situations.

The right to restrict processing

* You have the right to ask us to restrict our use of your personal information in some circumstances. We may be able to restrict the use of your personal information. In this situation we would not use or share your personal information while it is restricted. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances.
