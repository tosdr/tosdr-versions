Collecting browser activities or IP addresses, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited, are common practices, and are often performed automatically by many websites, applications and other services for such purposes as calculating usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, improving and administering the Services. In addition, we and our service providers may:

* Collect information that can identify the physical location of your mobile device or geographic location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi signals to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.
* Use "Cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to the Services or your responses to our e-mails or other electronic communications-both individually and in an aggregated form. Cookies are pieces of data placed on your device when you visit the Websites that help us recognize you when you come back to the Website, allowing us, for example, to recognize you as a returning visitor to our website. We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Websites. We also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements, but will respect the Do Not Track selections made in your browser and applicable cookie selections. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services and you may not be able to access some of the features we offer. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.
* Use cookies and tracking pixels on the Website to associate your session to other information you have already provided to us in other Services. For example, partners may combine your email information with other Personal Information they have access to such as mailing address so that We may serve relevant content to you via direct mail. 
* Employ third-party web and mobile app analytics and optimization services to improve the Services and enhance the visitor experience by, for example, recording mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as text you type in the Services.
* Use pixel tags and other similar technologies to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about use of the Services and response rates.
* Employ common analytics tools, such as Google Analytics which use Cookies and other similar technologies to collect information about use of Services anonymously and report Website trends. You can learn about Google's practices by visiting [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and you may opt out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
* Collect information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded.
* Aggregate information: We share aggregate statistics and other non-personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, analysis or similar purposes. These aggregate statistics will not allow anyone to identify you.

### Our Advertising

We may use third-party advertising companies to address advertisements that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Services and other websites, based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other websites. To do so, such companies may place or recognize a unique Cookie on your browser (including through use of pixel tags). They may also use these technologies, along with your Mobile Advertising ID and information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a phone, tablet or laptop.

This advertising may be directed to you because you visited or logged in to our website. When we generate this advertising, data we collect from you through online Cookies your Mobile Advertising ID, and other technologies may be combined with other de-identified data (such as a hashed, non-readable email or postal address) in order to tailor ads on your computer, device or Smart TV to you or your business based on your preferences and other information about you.

If you are under 18 and a registered user of any of the Services you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Services by emailing us at [Privacy@edf.org](mailto:Privacy@edf.org).  Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.

### Your US State Specific Privacy Rights

* Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
* Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
