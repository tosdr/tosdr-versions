**Unsolicited Information**

Lotus and any of its employees do not accept or consider unsolicited ideas, including ideas for new advertising campaigns, new promotions, new or improved products or technologies, product enhancements, processes, materials, marketing plans or new product names. Please do not submit any unsolicited ideas, original creative artwork, suggestions or other works (“submissions”) in any form to Lotus or any of its employees.  All such submissions will be destroyed without being read or considered. 

**Product Presentation**

At Lotus, we make every effort to represent our products as accurately as possible. However, due to photography techniques and differences in monitor color and display capabilities, images of products may appear slightly smaller or larger than actual size, and color may vary. Other items may be represented at a larger than actual size in order to clearly show details, or smaller than actual size in order to show the entire item. We are not responsible for the limitations of technology and do not guarantee that your screen’s display of any color, size, texture or detail of the products will be accurate.

Figures detailed on our site are target specifications based upon simulations. We have carried out thousands of hours of computer modelling, dynamic simulation and engineering development that have contributed to the target specifications. These figures may not reflect real life driving results, which will depend upon a number of factors including the options fitted, variations in weather, driving styles and vehicle load. The CO2 produced under real life driving conditions will depend upon a number of factors including the accessories fitted after registration, variations in driving styles, weather conditions and vehicle load. We endeavor to keep the information on the website up to date and we reserve the right to change these product specifications at any time without notice.

**No Offer to Sell or Lease**

The purchase of any Lotus vehicle shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable sale or lease contract. Any Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) listed on our site excludes taxes, delivery, title, license and local fees. Actual retailer price may vary. Our site shall not be used or relied upon by you as a substitute for information that is available from an authorized Lotus retailer.

**Indemnification**

By use of our site or Lotus social media site, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, Lotus, each of its affiliated companies, and each of its respective partners, suppliers, subsidiaries, licensors, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representatives, contractors and agents, from any and all liabilities, claims and expenses (including, but not limited to, claims for defamation, trade disparagement, privacy and intellectual property infringement) and damages (including attorneys' fees and court costs) arising from or relating to any allegation regarding your use or misuse of our site, social media site or any violation of these Terms and Conditions.

We reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in our sole discretion. If you breach any Terms and Conditions you may be subject to civil and/or criminal liability and we may take such legal action as we deem necessary and expedient.

**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles.

If you are a consumer outside of the United States who accesses a link to the section of our site designed for the country where you are located, you are subject to the law of your country of residence. By accessing the section of our site designed for the country where you are located, you agree to the jurisdiction of that country’s courts with respect to any dispute relating to the use of the country-specific website that is not subject to arbitration hereunder.

**Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**

Neither you nor Lotus will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action or private attorney general action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitrations or proceedings.

You and Lotus agree to arbitrate, as provided below, all disputes between you that are not resolved informally, except disputes relating to the ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights. "Dispute" as used here means any dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, between you and us concerning these Terms and Conditions or the products or services provided to you, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. You and Lotus empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these Terms or the formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable. The arbitrator’s award shall consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

In the event of a dispute, you or Lotus must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any notice of dispute to Lotus:

Legal Dept.

Lotus Cars USA, LLC

47584 Galleon Dr.

Plymouth, Michigan 48170,

United States

We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and Lotus will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent.

After that sixty (60) day period, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. You or we may instead litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or not you negotiated informally first.

If you and Lotus do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right to set aside the award under the Federal Arbitration Act. **YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY**. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures, as amended by these Terms and Conditions. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures are available online at [https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/).

In connection with such arbitration: (A) the arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate, (B) any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances, and (C) if the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by JAMS or by the arbitrator; provided, however, that to the extent (and only to such extent) the applicable arbitration rules expressly provide otherwise, such arbitration rules will supersede subsections (A)-(C) of this paragraph.

If you initiate arbitration proceedings against us, you will be required to pay a filing fee. All other costs shall be borne by us. In case we initiate arbitration proceedings against you, we will bear all costs associated with the arbitration.

You and Lotus agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the State of Delaware, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. You and Lotus hereby consent to recognition and enforcement of any resulting award in any jurisdiction and waive any defense to recognition or enforcement based upon lack of jurisdiction over the person or property or based upon any doctrine of forum non conveniens.

Except as provided above with respect to jurisdiction in the State of Delaware, nothing in this arbitration provision shall be construed as consent by Lotus or any of its affiliates to the personal jurisdiction of any other court with regard to disputes, claims or controversies unrelated to these Terms and Conditions.
