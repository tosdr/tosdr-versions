##### First, Some Background

_A quick note about Plaid_

Our mission at Plaid is to unlock financial freedom for everyone. By delivering access to high-quality, usable financial account data that we’ve translated and standardized, we enable developers of financial apps and services to focus on building experiences that benefit you.

_About this Policy_

Our goal with this Policy is to provide a simple and straightforward explanation of what data Plaid collects from and about you and how we use and share that information. We value transparency and want to provide you with a clear and concise description of how we treat your data.

This Policy does not cover what developers of the apps you use do with your data. You should review the privacy policies or terms of service for those apps for information about their practices. This Policy also does not cover data we collect through our websites or when you interact with Plaid outside of using our product or services, such as emailing Plaid directly. Please see our [All Audience Privacy Statement](#privacy-statement) and [Cookie Policy](#cookie-policy) for more information.

Plaid’s services are not directed to individuals under 18 and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.

##### Our Data Practices

Plaid is committed to providing end users with meaningful control over their data. This section describes Plaid’s data practices relating to our processing of data about you. We also provide summaries of our practices organized by category of data collected and by product at the end of this Policy in the [Summaries of Processing Activities](#summaries-of-processing-activities) section.

##### Data We Collect and Categories of Sources

As explained in greater detail below, the data we collect, use, and share depends on the Plaid products and services that you, and or the app you have connected to, use. Depending on which of Plaid’s products or services you or the developer you are connecting to use, Plaid may collect the following:

* Data you provide to us;
    
* Data from financial institutions when you connect your financial account;
    
* Data from the electronic device you use to connect your financial account through Plaid or to otherwise interact with Plaid;
    
* Data from the developer of the app you have connected to;
    
* Data from our affiliates to provide support to you or to provide you with a better user experience; and/or
    
* Data from other sources, including service providers and identity verification and fraud prevention services.
    

**Data you provide to us.** When you use Plaid’s products or services (like when you use Plaid to connect your financial accounts to an app) we collect the following data from you as needed to power your particular app or service:

* **identifiers** like name, email address, date of birth, Social Security number, and phone number;
    
* **login data** when required by the provider of your account, like your username and password, account and routing number, or a security token;
    
* **any additional information needed to connect your accounts,** including security questions and answers, and one-time password (OTP) and/or
    
* information from **documents or statements** that you provide to Plaid, like bank statements or pay stubs.
    

When you provide login data and additional information needed to connect your accounts, you also give Plaid permission and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit data to and from your financial institution.

**Data we collect from financial institutions about and from your accounts.** Depending on which Plaid products or services you, or the developer of your app use, as well as what, and how information is made available, we may collect the following data from your financial institutions:

* **Account data**, including financial institution name, account name, account type, account ownership, branch number, IBAN, BIC, account number, routing number, and sort code;
    
* **Data about an account balance**, including current and available balance;
    
* **Data about credit accounts**, including due dates, balances owed, payment amounts and dates, transaction history, credit limit, repayment status, and interest rate;
    
* **Data about loan accounts**, including due dates, repayment status, balances, payment amounts and dates, interest rate, guarantor, loan type, payment plan, and terms;
    
* **Data about investment accounts**, including transaction information, type of asset, identifying details about the asset, quantity, price, fees, and cost basis;
    
* **Identifiers** and data about the account owner(s), including name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and address information;
    
* **Data about account transactions**, including amount, date, payee, type, quantity, price, location, involved securities, and a description of the transaction; and/or
    
* **Data from your payroll and tax documents**, including data about your income and employer, in cases where you’ve connected your payroll accounts or provided us with your pay stub or tax form information.
    

Depending on the Plaid service you or the developer of your app use, and the manner in which the data is made available, the data collected from your financial accounts may include data from all accounts (e.g., checking, savings, credit card, and joint accounts) accessible through a single set of account credentials. For more specifics about data collected in connection with different products and services, see [Summary of Processing Activities by Product](#sopa-by-product).

**Data we receive from your devices.** When you use a device, like your smartphone, tablet, or computer, to interact with our services (including through a developer’s app), we may collect the following data about that device:

* internet protocol (IP) address;
    
* timezone setting and location, device location;
    
* hardware model and operating system;
    
* features within our services you access;
    
* browser data;
    
* network data; and
    
* other technical data about the device (such as settings and preferences).
    

**Data we receive about you from the developers of apps powered by Plaid.** When needed for Plaid to provide a service (like verifying your identity, protecting against fraud or risk, or enabling a bank transfer), the developers of the apps you use may provide us with identifiers and commercial information about you, like your name, Social Security number, email address, phone number, or information about your financial accounts and transactions.

**Data from our affiliates to provide support to you or to provide you with a better user experience.** We may collect data from our affiliates (these are companies related to us by common ownership or control) to provide support to you or improve your experience. For example, if you elect for Plaid CRA to remember financial accounts associated with your phone number, we may collect the following data from Plaid CRA in order to help you connect to your accounts faster when using our services:

* **identifiers** like name, email address, and phone number;
    
* **login data** when required by the provider of your account, like your username and password, bank name, account and routing number, or a security token;
    
* when needed, **data to help verify your identity and connect your accounts,** including your date of birth, security questions and answers, and one-time password (OTP); and/or
    
* data from your device (as explained in more detail above).
    

**Data we receive about you from other sources.** When needed to provide a service, identify your device, or to help prevent fraud, abuse, or security threats, we may also receive data about you directly from third parties, including your wireless carrier, agents and our service providers.

**Information we derive from the data we collect.** We may derive additional information about you from the data we collect. For example, we may infer your geolocation, your annual income, or the type of account or subaccount you’ve chosen to connect―such as when you connect your loan accounts, so we can let the developer know whether the account is for a mortgage, student loan, or credit card.

##### How We Use Your Data

We use your data for the following business and commercial purposes:

* **Provide Services:** To operate, provide, and maintain our services.
    
* **Develop Existing Services:** To improve, enhance, modify, add to, and further develop our services.
    
* **Help Prevent Fraud, Verify Your Identity, or Protect Privacy:** To verify your identity and help protect you, developers, our partners, Plaid, and others from fraud, malicious activity, and other privacy and security-related concerns.
    
* **Develop New Services:** To develop new products and services.
    
* **Develop Insights:** To develop insights based on the data we’ve collected about you. This includes your transaction data, other financial data, and data from other sources, to help developers of your connected apps provide services and/or a better user experience to you, like providing you with faster access to your funds,to help detect and prevent potentially fraudulent activity, or personalize their services to you.
    
* **Provide Support:** To provide support to you or to developers, including to help respond to your inquiries related to our services or developers’ apps.
    
* **Communicate With You:** To communicate with you and send you things like technical notices, updates, security alerts, and messages if you use Plaid Portal or Remember Me.
    
* **Investigate Misuse and Misconduct:** To investigate any misuse of our service or developers’ apps, including violations of our [Developer Policy](https://plaid.com/legal/#developer-policy), criminal activity, or other unauthorized access to our services.
    
* **For Legal Purposes:** To comply with contractual and legal obligations under applicable law and for other legal purposes such as to establish and defend against claims.
    
* **With Your Consent:** For other notified purposes with your consent or at your direction.
    

We collect, use, and share data that has been aggregated or anonymized in a manner that does not identify you personally for any purpose permitted under applicable law. This includes creating or using aggregated or anonymized data to develop new services, or to facilitate research, and for analytics purposes to help assess the speed, accuracy, and/or security of our services.

##### Our Lawful Bases for Processing (EEA and UK End Users)

For individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), Plaid only processes your personal data when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Our legal basis for processing the data we collect will depend on what data we collected and the purpose for processing it. Generally, we will only collect and process your data where:

* we are bound by any contract or agreement with you (for example, to comply with our end user services agreements) and must adhere to various legal requirements when offering regulated services, including our account information and payment services.
    
* we require your data to comply with our legal obligations under applicable law, to safeguard Plaid's legal rights, and prevent and identify criminal activities such as money laundering and fraud. For these purposes, Plaid may find it necessary to share your personal data with entities such as courts, law enforcement agencies, and providers of anti-money laundering services;
    
* processing is necessary for our legitimate interests to effectively maintain the integrity of our services. This includes retrieving account information or providing payment initiation services (as well as verifying the output of this activity), engaging in communication with you, and ensuring that Plaid, as a regulated entity, upholds the expected standards (including those stipulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for Plaid Financial Ltd and De Nederlandsche Bank for Plaid B.V).; or
    
* you have given your consent to do so.
    

To the extent we rely on consent to collect and process your data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time per the instructions provided in this Policy.

##### How We Share Your Data

We share your data for the following reasons:

* With the developer of the app you are using and as directed by that developer;
    
* To enforce any contract with you;
    
* With our data processors and other service providers, partners, agents or contractors in connection with the services they perform for us or developers;
    
* With financial institutions to help establish, maintain, or manage a connection you’ve chosen to make between your financial institution accounts and an app;
    
* If we believe in good faith that disclosure is appropriate to comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process (like a court order or subpoena);
    
* In connection with a change in ownership or control of all or a part of our business (like a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or bankruptcy);
    
* Between and among Plaid and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control or ownership;
    
* As we believe reasonably appropriate to prevent malicious or fraudulent activities, or otherwise protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of you, developers, our partners, Plaid, and others; or
    
* For any other notified purpose with your consent or at your direction.
    

(For US users) We do not share your data with non-affiliated third parties except as permitted by law (as authorized by 12 C.F.R. § 1016.14 and 1016.15).

When you link your financial accounts through Plaid, we typically use Google’s reCAPTCHA service to help detect fraud and abuse. Google reCAPTCHA is integrated into Plaid products and services in order to ensure that entries made in online forms, for example, are actually made by real persons and are not automated by software (or bots).

Google reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of users of our products and services using different characteristics. Google reCAPTCHA processes personal data such as your IP address, your length of stay on our website and further information about your use of Plaid products and services. This data will be transmitted and stored by Google on servers in the United States and other countries. Google has certified with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework; the certificate is available [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active). When reCAPTCHA is used, Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply to reCAPTCHA and information Google collects through reCAPTCHA.

We only share your personal financial data with third parties to power the services you requested, when you consent, and/or to protect against fraud.

We may collect and share cookie data with third parties when you visit our website, or we may allow third parties to collect this cookie data from our sites. Please see our [Cookie Policy](#cookie-policy) and [All Audience Privacy Statement](#privacy-statement) for more details.

##### Our Retention and Deletion Practices

We retain your data only as long as it is needed. To determine whether the data is needed, we consider the reason your data was collected and used and any legal requirements to hold onto your data. We review your data periodically to ensure it is still needed to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or any other legal requirements. If a developer removes your connection from their app to your data, Plaid’s systems are designed to automatically delete your personal data, subject to certain exceptions where we may still retain your information.

The exceptions to this may be if: (a) you’ve established a connection with another developer’s app through Plaid that is still active; (b) Plaid needs your data to continue providing you with a Plaid service you requested; (c) Plaid is required by law to keep your data; (d) Plaid needs your data to help prevent fraud or protect privacy, provide support, or investigate misuse and misconduct; (e) where Plaid has anonymized your data such that it can not reidentified or (f) we request - and you specifically agree - to allow us to retain your data longer.

Your data will only be processed as required by law or in accordance with this Policy.

Please refer to the “Your Data Protection Rights” section of this Policy for options that may be available to you, including how to request deletion of your data. The “Your Privacy Controls” section of this Policy also provides details about tools available to you to help you view and manage the connections you’ve made using Plaid. You can also contact us about our data retention practices using the contact information in the “Contacting Plaid” section below.

##### Protection of Data

Plaid’s security policies and practices are designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data. Plaid implements controls designed to limit access to this data to personnel who have a business reason to know it and prohibits its personnel from unlawfully accessing, using or disclosing this data.

##### Some Final Details

##### International Data Transfers

We operate internationally, and so we transfer the data we collect about you across international borders for processing and storage (for example, we transfer data from the EEA and UK to the United States and store data in AWS regions located in the United States). When we transfer data to a different country or territory, we follow applicable data protection laws in doing so. In particular, when we transfer data from the EEA or UK across other international borders, we rely on adequacy decisions, data transfer agreements, or other EU Commission- or UK Secretary of State-approved (as applicable) mechanisms for such transfers, including standard contractual clauses. You can ask for a copy of these standard contractual clauses by contacting us as set out below. Prior to transferring data from the EEA or UK, we carry out transfer impact assessments and implement any supplementary measures to ensure any data transferred will be maintained in accordance with EEA and UK requirements.

##### Your Data Protection Rights

Regardless of where you live, we will honor the following rights related to your personal data, subject to some limitations and exceptions provided by law, and you will not be discriminated against for exercising them:

* Access data collected about you;
    
* Request access to more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we may have collected about you in the last 12 months (including personal information disclosed for business purposes);
    
* Request, under certain circumstances, that we rectify or update your data that is inaccurate or incomplete;
    
* Request, under certain circumstances, that we erase or restrict the processing of your data;
    
* Object to our processing of your data under certain conditions provided by law;
    
* Where processing of your data is based on consent, withdraw that consent;
    
* Request that we provide data collected about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format so that you can transfer it to another company, where technically feasible.
    
    * Please note that for an official record of your financial information you should make that request directly to your financial institution.
        
    

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to lodge a complaint. We welcome and appreciate the chance to address any concerns you may have and encourage you to contact us.

##### Tout d’abord, le contexte

_Un mot sur Plaid_

Notre mission à Plaid est de dynamiser les innovateurs en leur donnant accès au système financier et débloquer la liberté financière pour tous. En fournissant un accès à des données de comptes financiers exploitables et de haute qualité que nous avons traduites et normalisées, nous permettons à nos développeurs d’applis et de services financiers de se concentrer sur la création d’expériences à votre bénéfice.

_Au sujet de cette Politique_

Notre objectif avec cette Politique est de fournir une explication simple et directe sur les données collectées par Plaid sur vous, et sur la façon dont nous utilisons et partageons ces informations. Nous attachons une attention particulière à la transparence et souhaitons vous donner une description claire et concise de la façon dont nous traitons vos données.

Cette Politique ne couvre pas ce que les développeurs des applis que vous utilisez font de vos données. Vous devez lire les politiques de confidentialité ou les conditions de service de ces applis pour en savoir plus sur leurs pratiques.

**Les données que nous collectons auprès d’établissements financiers à propos et à partir de vos comptes.** Suivant les produits ou services Plaid utilisés par vous ou par le développeur de l’appli que vous utilisez, et selon la nature et la façon dont les informations sont mises à disposition, nous sommes susceptibles de collecter les données suivantes auprès de vos établissements financiers :

Selon le service Plaid que vous ou le développeur de votre appli utilisez, et la manière dont les données sont mises à disposition, les données collectées à partir de vos comptes financiers peuvent inclure des données provenant de tous les comptes (par exemple, compte chèque, compte d’épargne, carte de crédit et comptes communs) accessibles par un seul ensemble d’identifiants de compte. Pour en savoir plus sur les données collectées en lien avec différents produits et services, consultez la [Synthèse des activités de traitement par produit](#synthèses-des-activités-de-traitement-par-produit).

**Les données que nous recevons à partir de vos appareils.** Lorsque vous utilisez un appareil, comme votre smartphone, votre tablette ou votre ordinateur, pour interagir avec nos services (notamment via l’appli d’un développeur), nous sommes susceptible de collecter les données suivantes sur cet appareil :

* l’adresse de protocole Internet (IP) ;
    
* le réglage et l’emplacement du fuseau horaire, le lieu de l’appareil ;
    
* le modèle d’appareil et le système d’exploitation ;
    
* les fonctionnalités de nos services auxquelles vous accédez ;
    
* les données du navigateur ;
    
* les données réseau ; et
    
* d’autres données techniques concernant l’appareil (telles que les paramètres et les préférences).
    

**Les données que nous recevons sur vous auprès des développeurs d’applis prises en charge par Plaid.** Lorsque cela est nécessaire à la fourniture d’un service par Plaid (comme la vérification de votre identité, la protection contre la fraude ou le fait de rendre possible un virement), les développeurs des applis que vous utilisez peuvent nous fournir des éléments d’identification et des informations commerciales sur vous, comme votre nom, votre numéro de sécurité sociale, votre adresse e-mail, votre numéro de téléphone ou des informations sur vos comptes financiers et transactions.

**Données provenant de nos sociétés affiliées pour vous fournir une assistance, ou pour vous proposer une meilleure expérience utilisateur.** Nous pouvons collecter des données auprès de nos sociétés affiliées (il s’agit de sociétés auxquelles nous sommes liés par une propriété ou un contrôle commun) afin de vous fournir un soutien ou d’améliorer votre expérience. Par exemple, si vous choisissez que Plaid CRA se souvienne des comptes financiers associés à votre numéro de téléphone, nous pouvons collecter les données suivantes auprès de Plaid CRA afin de vous aider à vous connecter à vos comptes plus rapidement lorsque vous utilisez nos services :

* **les éléments d’identification** comme le nom, l’adresse e-mail et le numéro de téléphone ;
    
* **les données de connexion** lorsque cela est exigé par le fournisseur de votre compte, par exemple votre identifiant et votre mot de passe, le nom de la banque, votre numéro de compte et le code d’acheminement ou un jeton de sécurité ;

* les données de votre appareil (comme expliqué plus en détail ci-dessus).
    

**Les données que nous recevons sur vous provenant d’autres sources.** Lorsque cela est nécessaire pour fournir un service, pour identifier votre appareil ou pour empêcher la fraude, les actes malveillants ou les menaces à la sécurité, nous sommes également susceptibles de recevoir des données sur vous directement auprès de tiers, par exemple votre opérateur sans fil, des mandataires et nos prestataires de services.

**Les informations que nous déduisons à partir des données que nous collectons.** Nous sommes susceptibles de déduire des informations sur vous à partir des données que nous collectons. Par exemple, nous pouvons déduire votre géolocalisation, votre revenu annuel ou le type de compte ou de compte secondaire que vous avez choisi de connecter, par exemple lorsque vous connectez vos comptes de prêt, afin de permettre au développeur de savoir si le compte correspond à un emprunt hypothécaire, à un prêt étudiant ou à une carte de crédit.

##### Les bases juridiques sur lesquelles nous nous appuyons pour le traitement (Utilisateurs au sein de l’EEE et du Royaume-Uni)

Pour les personnes situées dans l’Espace économique européen (« EEE ») ou le Royaume-Uni, Plaid traite uniquement vos données personnelles lorsque nous pouvons nous appuyer sur une base juridique à cette fin. La base juridique sur laquelle nous nous appuyons pour traiter les données que nous recueillons dépendra des données que nous avons recueillies et de la finalité de leur traitement. En règle générale, nous ne recueillerons et ne traiterons des données que lorsque :

* nous sommes liés par tout contrat ou accord avec vous (par exemple, pour nous conformer à nos contrats de services aux utilisateurs finaux) et devons respecter diverses exigences légales lorsque nous proposons des services réglementés, y compris nos services d’informations de compte et de paiement.
    
* nous exigeons que vos données soient conformes à nos obligations légales en vertu des lois en vigueur, pour protéger les droits légaux de Plaid, et pour prévenir et identifier les activités criminelles telles que le blanchiment de capitaux et la fraude. À ces fins, Plaid peut juger nécessaire de partager vos données à caractère personnel avec des entités telles que des tribunaux, des autorités publiques et des prestataires de services de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent ;
    
* le traitement est nécessaire à nos intérêts légitimes pour maintenir efficacement l’intégrité de nos services. Cela inclut la récupération des informations du compte ou la fourniture de services d’initiation de paiement (ainsi que la vérification des résultats de cette activité), la communication avec vous et le fait de veiller à ce que Plaid, en tant qu’entité réglementée, respecte les normes attendues (y compris celles stipulées par l’autorité de conduite financière (Financial Conduct Authority) pour Plaid Financial Ltd et De Nederlandsche Bank pour Plaid B.V). ; ou
    
* vous nous avez donné votre consentement pour ce faire.
    

Dans la mesure où nous nous reposons sur ce consentement pour collecter et traiter vos données, vous avez le droit de retirer votre consentement à tout moment selon les instructions prévues dans la présente Politique.

##### Comment nous partageons vos données

Nous partageons vos données pour les raisons suivantes :

* avec le développeur de l’appli que vous utilisez, et selon les instructions du développeur ;
    
* pour faire exécuter un contrat avec vous ;
    
* avec nos sous-traitants intervenant dans le traitement de vos données et autres prestataires de services, partenaires, mandataires ou sous-traitants concernant les services qu’ils réalisent pour nous ou pour nos développeurs ;
    
* avec les établissements financiers afin d’établir, de maintenir ou de gérer une connexion que vous avez choisi d’établir entre vos comptes auprès de votre établissement financier et une appli ;
    
* si nous estimons de bonne foi que la divulgation de vos Informations est appropriée pour se conformer à la loi, la réglementation ou les processus légaux applicables (tels qu’une ordonnance du tribunal ou une assignation) ;
    
* dans le cas d’une modification de propriété ou de contrôle de tout ou partie de notre activité (telle qu’une fusion, acquisition, réorganisation ou faillite) ;
    
* au sein de Plaid et entre Plaid et nos sociétés mères actuelles et futures, nos affiliés, filiales et autres sociétés sous contrôle et propriété commune ;
    
* parce que nous estimons que cela est raisonnablement approprié afin d’empêcher les activités malveillantes ou frauduleuses, ou autrement pour protéger vos droits, votre vie privée, votre sécurité ou vos biens ou ceux de développeurs, de nos partenaires, de Plaid et d’autres ; ou
    
* à toute autre fin déclarée, avec votre consentement ou selon vos instructions.
    

(Destiné aux utilisateurs situés aux États-Unis) Nous ne partageons pas vos données avec des tiers non affiliés, sauf dans la mesure autorisée par la loi (tel qu’autorisé par 12 C.F.R. § 1016.14 et 1016.15).

Lorsque vous connectez vos comptes financiers via Plaid, nous utilisons généralement le service reCAPTCHA de Google pour nous aider à détecter la fraude et les activités malveillantes. Google reCAPTCHA est intégré aux produits et services Plaid afin de s’assurer que les saisies effectuées dans les formulaires en ligne, par exemple, sont effectivement effectuées par des personnes réelles et ne sont pas automatisées par des logiciels (ou des robots).

Google reCAPTCHA analyse le comportement des utilisateurs de nos produits et services en utilisant différentes caractéristiques. Google reCAPTCHA traite des données à caractère personnel telles que votre adresse IP, votre durée de séjour sur notre site Web et d’autres informations sur votre utilisation des produits et services Plaid. Ces données seront transmises et stockées par Google sur des serveurs aux États-Unis et dans d’autres pays. Google a obtenu la certification UE-États-Unis Data Privacy Framework ; le certificat est disponible [ici](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active). Lorsque reCAPTCHA est utilisé, la [Politique de confidentialité](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=fr) et les [Conditions d'utilisation de Google](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=fr) s'appliquent à reCAPTCHA et aux informations que collecte Google via reCAPTCHA.

Nous ne partageons vos données financières personnelles avec des tiers que pour permettre la fourniture des services que vous avez demandés, lorsque vous y consentez, et/ou pour vous protéger contre la fraude.

Nous sommes susceptibles de collecter et de partager des données de cookies avec des tiers lorsque vous visitez notre site Web. Nous pouvons aussi autoriser des tiers à collecter ces données de cookies sur nos sites. Si vous souhaitez en savoir plus, nous vous renvoyons à notre [Politique relative aux cookies](#politique-relative-aux-cookies) et à la [Politique de confidentialité](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=fr) tous publics.

##### Nos pratiques en matière de conservation et de suppression

Nous conservons vos données uniquement le temps nécessaire. Pour déterminer si des données sont nécessaires, nous prenons en compte la raison pour laquelle vos données ont été collectées et utilisées et toute exigence légale de conserver vos données. Nous examinons régulièrement vos données pour veiller à ce qu’elles soient toujours nécessaires pour réaliser la finalité pour laquelle elles ont été collectées, ou pour satisfaire à toute autre exigence légale. Si un développeur supprime votre connexion entre son appli et vos données, les systèmes de Plaid sont conçus pour supprimer automatiquement vos données personnelles, hormis certaines exceptions où nous pourrions conserver vos informations.

Les exceptions peuvent être les suivantes : (a) vous avez établi une connexion avec l’appli d’un autre développeur via Plaid qui est toujours active ; (b) Plaid a besoin de vos données pour continuer à vous fournir un service Plaid que vous avez sollicité ; (c) Plaid est tenu par la loi de conserver vos données ; (d) Plaid a besoin de vos données à des fins de lutte contre la fraude ou de protection de la vie privée, pour fournir une assistance ou enquêter sur des détournements ou des manquements ; ou (e) lorsque Plaid a anonymisé vos données de telle sorte qu'elles ne puissent pas être réidentifiées ou (f) nous vous demandons (et vous acceptez expressément) de nous permettre de conserver vos données plus longtemps.

Vos données ne seront traitées que selon les exigences de la loi ou conformément à la présente Politique.

Veuillez vous référer à la section relative à « Vos droits à la protection de vos données » pour les options qui sont mises à votre disposition, y compris la façon de demander la suppression de vos données. La section « Vos contrôles en matière de vie privée » dans cette Politique contient également des informations sur les outils à votre disposition pour consulter et gérer les connexions que vous avez établies via Plaid. Vous pouvez également nous contacter au sujet de nos pratiques de conservation des données en utilisant les informations de contact ci-dessous.

##### Protection des données

Les politiques et pratiques de sécurité de Plaid sont conçues pour protéger la confidentialité et l’intégrité de vos données. Plaid met en œuvre des contrôles conçus pour limiter l’accès à ces données au personnel qui a une raison professionnelle de les connaître et interdit à son personnel d’accéder, d’utiliser ou de divulguer ces données lorsque cela est contraire à la loi.

##### Quelques derniers détails

##### Transferts internationaux de données

Nous opérons dans le monde entier et de ce fait, nous transférons les données que nous collectons sur vous au-delà des frontières à des fins de traitement et de stockage (par exemple, nous transférons des données l’EEE et du Royaume-Uni vers les États-Unis et stockons des données dans des régions AWS situées aux États-Unis). Lorsque nous transférons des données vers un autre pays ou territoire, nous respectons ce faisant les lois de protection des données en vigueur. En particulier, lorsque nous transférons des données de l’EEE ou du Royaume-Uni vers d’autres pays, nous nous appuyons sur des décisions d’adéquation, des accords de transfert de données ou sur d’autres mécanismes approuvés (le cas échéant) par la Commission européenne ou le Secrétaire d’État du Royaume-Uni, notamment les clauses contractuelles types. Vous pouvez demander un exemplaire de ces clauses contractuelles types en nous contactant comme indiqué ci-dessous. Avant de transférer des données à partir de l’EEE ou du Royaume-Uni, nous procédons à des évaluations d’impact du transfert et mettons en œuvre toute mesure supplémentaire pour nous assurer que les données transférées seront conservées conformément aux exigences de l’EEE et du Royaume-Uni.

##### Vos droits en matière de protection des données

Indépendamment de l’endroit où vous vivez, nous respecterons les droits suivants liés à vos données personnelles, sous réserve de certaines limites et exceptions prévues par la loi, et vous ne ferez l’objet d’aucune discrimination en exerçant ces droits :

* vous opposer au traitement de vos données et ce, sous certaines conditions prévues par la loi ;
    
* lorsque le traitement de vos données est basé sur votre consentement, retirer ce consentement ;
    
* demander que nous vous communiquions vos données dans un format structuré, couramment utilisé et lisible par machine, afin que vous puissiez les transmettre à une autre société, lorsque cela est techniquement possible.
    
    * Veuillez noter que pour un relevé officiel de vos informations financières, vous devez faire cette demande directement à votre établissement financier.
        

Selon votre lieu de résidence, vous pouvez avoir le droit de déposer une plainte. Nous accueillons favorablement et apprécions la possibilité de traiter toute préoccupation que vous pourriez avoir et nous vous encourageons à nous contacter. En outre, et selon votre lieu de résidence, vous pouvez avoir le droit de déposer plainte à tout moment auprès de votre autorité de contrôle (en charge de la protection des données).

Vous pouvez aussi nous contacter comme précisé dans la section « Contacter Plaid » ci-dessous, pour exercer vos droits en matière de protection des données. Il peut vous être demandé de fournir des informations supplémentaires pour confirmer votre identité avant que nous répondions à votre demande.

Si nous recevons votre demande d’un agent autorisé, nous pouvons demander la preuve que cet agent dispose d’une autorisation écrite valable, par exemple une procuration, pour soumettre des demandes en votre nom.

Nous prendrons en compte toutes les demandes et fournirons notre réponse dans une période de temps raisonnable (et dans la période requise par la loi applicable). Veuillez noter, cependant, que certaines données peuvent être exclues de ces demandes, par exemple si nous conservons les données pour nous conformer à nos obligations légales ou pour initier, exercer ou défendre une action légale.

Pour Plaid Financial Ltd. comme pour Plaid, B.V., nous avons désigné un délégué à la protection des données (DPD) qui est également responsable des questions de supervision en lien avec cette Politique. Vous pouvez le contacter par e-mail à l’adresse [privacy@plaid.com](mailto:privacy@plaid.com).

##### Les contrôles supplémentaires dont vous disposez en matière de confidentialité

Plaid a mis en place le [Plaid Portal](https://plaid.com/legal/my.plaid.com) pour vous proposer une façon pratique et centralisée de consulter et de gérer les connexions que vous avez établies via Plaid.

Si vous êtes situé(e) aux États-Unis, vous pouvez vous inscrire à Plaid Portal en vous rendant sur my.plaid.com, en vérifiant votre numéro de téléphone et votre adresse e-mail, et en créant un mot de passe. Une fois que vous vous serez inscrit à Plaid Portal, vous serez dirigé(e) vers un tableau de bord où s’afficheront vos comptes financiers que vous avez connectés aux applis de votre choix via Plaid, et les types de données partagées avec ces applis. En outre, le Plaid Portal vous fournit des contrôles pour mettre fin à des connexions entre des applis et vos comptes financiers et supprimer les données associées conservées dans les systèmes de Plaid.

##### Modifications apportées à cette Politique

De temps à autre, nous mettons à jour ou modifions la présente Politique. Si nous réalisons des changements, nous mettrons en ligne la nouvelle politique sur le site web de Plaid à [https://plaid.com/legal](https://plaid.com/legal) et indiquerons la date d’entrée en vigueur de cette Politique. Nous informerons également nos développeurs de toute modification importante en lien avec nos accords avec les développeurs, car ces derniers peuvent être mieux positionnés pour vous informer des changements à la présente Politique.

Al proporcionar acceso a datos útiles y de gran calidad sobre cuentas financieras, los cuales hemos traducido y estandarizado, permitimos que los desarrolladores de aplicaciones y servicios financieros puedan centrarse en crear experiencias que lo beneficien a usted.

Esta Política no abarca lo que los desarrolladores de las aplicaciones que usted utiliza hacen con sus datos. Deberá revisar las políticas de privacidad o los términos de servicio para esas aplicaciones si desea obtener información sobre sus prácticas. Esta Política tampoco cubre los datos que recabamos mediante nuestros sitios web ni cuando usted interactúa con Plaid fuera del uso de nuestros productos o servicios, como, por ejemplo cuando envía correos electrónicos a Plaid directamente. Le recomendamos que consulte nuestra [Declaración de privacidad para todos los públicos](#declaración-de-privacidad) y la [Política de cookies](#política-de-cookies) si desea obtener más información.

Los servicios de Plaid no están previstos para personas menores de 18 años y no recabamos deliberadamente datos relacionados con menores de edad.

Para obtener más detalles acerca de los datos recabados en relación con los diferentes productos y servicios, consulte el [Resumen de las actividades de tratamiento por producto](#resúmen-de-las-actividades-de-tratamiento-por-producto)

**Datos que recibimos sobre usted desde los desarrolladores de aplicaciones proporcionadas por Plaid.** Cuando Plaid deba brindar un servicio (por ejemplo, verificar su identidad, brindarle protección contra fraudes o riesgos, o permitirle realizar una transferencia bancaria), los desarrolladores de las aplicaciones que usted usa podrán proporcionarnos identificadores e información comercial sobre usted, como, su nombre, número de Seguro Social, dirección de correo electrónico, número de teléfono o información sobre sus cuentas y transacciones financieras.

**Datos provenientes de nuestras empresas afiliadas, para brindarle soporte o para brindarle una mejor experiencia de usuario.** Podremos recabar datos provenientes de nuestras empresas afiliadas (empresas que se relacionan con nosotros por tener titularidad o control compartidos) para brindarle soporte o para mejorar su experiencia. Por ejemplo, si elige que Plaid CRA recuerde las cuentas financieras asociadas a su número de teléfono, podremos recabar los siguientes datos provenientes de Plaid CRA, para permitir que pueda conectarse a sus cuentas más rápido cuando utilice nuestros servicios:

* **identificadores,** como nombre, dirección de correo electrónico y número de teléfono;

**Información que extraemos de los datos que recabamos.** Podremos extraer información adicional sobre usted a partir de los datos que recabamos. Por ejemplo, podemos deducir su ubicación geográfica, sus ingresos anuales o el tipo de cuenta o subcuenta que ha elegido conectar; como cuando conecta sus cuentas de préstamos, para que podamos informar al desarrollador si la cuenta es para una hipoteca, un préstamo estudiantil o una tarjeta de crédito.

##### Nuestras bases legitimadoras para el tratamiento (usuarios finales del EEE y del Reino Unido)

En el caso de las personas que se encuentran en el Espacio Económico Europeo (“EEE”) o en el Reino Unido (“RU”), Plaid únicamente trata sus datos personales cuando tenemos una base legitimadora válida para hacerlo. Nuestra base legitimadora para tratar los datos que recabamos dependerá del tipo de datos que recabemos y del fin para el que los tratamos. En general, solamente recabaremos y trataremos sus datos cuando:

* estemos obligados por cualquier contrato o acuerdo con usted (por ejemplo, para cumplir con nuestros acuerdos de servicios del usuario final) y debamos cumplir con diversos requisitos legales al ofrecer servicios regulados, incluidos nuestros servicios de información de cuentas y pagos;
    
* necesitemos sus datos a fin de cumplir con nuestras obligaciones legales en virtud de la ley aplicable, para proteger los derechos legales de Plaid, y para prevenir e identificar actividades delictivas, como el lavado de dinero y el fraude. A tales efectos, Plaid puede considerar que es necesario compartir sus datos personales con entidades como tribunales, fuerzas de seguridad y proveedores de servicios que luchan contra el lavado de dinero;
    
* el tratamiento sea necesario para nuestros intereses legítimos, a fin de mantener la integridad de nuestros servicios de manera efectiva. Esto incluye recuperar información de la cuenta o prestar servicios de iniciación de pagos (así como verificar el resultado de esta actividad), interactuar con usted y garantizar que Plaid, en calidad de entidad regulada, cumpla con las normas previstas (incluidas las estipuladas por la autoridad de conductas financieras \[Financial Conduct Authority\] con respecto a Plaid Financial Ltd y por De Nederlandsche Bank con respecto a Plaid B. V.); o
    
* usted haya dado su consentimiento para hacerlo.
    

En la medida en que nos basemos en el consentimiento para recabar y tratar sus datos, usted tiene derecho a retirar su consentimiento en cualquier momento, conforme a las instrucciones proporcionadas en esta Política.

##### Cómo compartimos sus datos

Compartimos sus datos por las siguientes razones:

* con el desarrollador de la aplicación que usted está utilizando y según las indicaciones de dicho desarrollador;
    
* para el cumplimiento de cualquier contrato con usted;
    
* con nuestros encargados del tratamiento de datos y otros proveedores de servicios, socios o contratistas en relación con los servicios que nos prestan a nosotros o a los desarrolladores;
    
* con instituciones financieras, para ayudar a establecer, mantener y administrar una conexión que usted haya elegido hacer entre las cuentas de su institución financiera y una aplicación;
    
* cuando consideremos de buena fe que la divulgación es apropiada para cumplir con la normativa y legislación aplicables o con un proceso legal (por ejemplo, una orden o citación judicial);
    
* en relación con un cambio de titularidad o control de la totalidad o parte de nuestra empresa (por ejemplo, una fusión, adquisición, reestructuración o quiebra);
    
* entre Plaid y nuestras matrices, empresas afiliadas y otras empresas con titularidad o control compartidos presentes y futuras;
    
* en la medida en que lo consideremos razonablemente apropiado, para evitar actividades maliciosas o fraudulentas, proteger los derechos, la privacidad, la seguridad o los bienes suyos, de los desarrolladores, de nuestros socios, de Plaid y de otros; o
    
* para cualquier otro fin notificado, con su consentimiento o según sus instrucciones.
    

(Para usuarios de los EE. UU.) No compartimos sus datos con terceros no afiliados, salvo en casos permitidos por ley (según se autoriza en el Código de Regulaciones Federales \[Code of Federal Regulations, CFR\], título 12, arts. 1016.14 y 1016.15).

Cuando vincula sus cuentas financieras a través de Plaid, normalmente usamos el servicio reCAPTCHA de Google para ayudar a detectar fraudes y abusos. reCAPTCHA de Google está integrado en los productos y servicios de Plaid para garantizar que los datos ingresados en formularios en línea, por ejemplo, sean realmente realizados por personas reales y no de manera automatizada por software (o bots).

reCAPTCHA de Google analiza el comportamiento de los usuarios de nuestros productos y servicios mediante diferentes características. reCAPTCHA de Google trata datos personales, como su dirección IP, el tiempo que permanece en nuestro sitio web y demás información sobre el uso que usted hace de los productos y servicios de Plaid. Google transmitirá y almacenará dichos datos en servidores que se encuentran en los Estados Unidos y en otros países. Google ha obtenido la certificación del Marco de Privacidad de Datos entre la UE y los EE. UU. (EU-US Data Privacy Framework); el certificado se encuentra disponible [aquí](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active). Cuando usamos reCAPTCHA, se aplican la Política de privacidad y las Condiciones de uso de Google a reCAPTCHA y a la información que Google recaba mediante reCAPTCHA.

Únicamente compartimos sus datos financieros personales con terceros para potenciar los servicios que solicitó, cuando usted brinda su consentimiento o a fin de protegerlo contra fraudes.

Podemos recabar y compartir datos de cookies con terceros cuando usted visita nuestro sitio web, o podemos permitir que terceros recaben estos datos de cookies a partir de nuestros sitios. Le recomendamos que consulte la [Política de cookies](#política-de-cookies) y la [Política de privacidad para todos los públicos](#declaración-de-privacidad) si desea conocer más detalles.

##### Nuestras prácticas de conservación y eliminación

Conservamos sus datos solamente mientras sea necesario. Para determinar si los datos son necesarios, consideramos la razón por la cual se recabaron y utilizaron sus datos, y los requisitos legales para conservarlos. Revisamos sus datos de forma periódica para asegurarnos de que siguen siendo necesarios para cumplir con el fin para el que fueron recabados o para cualquier otro requisito legal. Si un desarrollador elimina la conexión que usted tiene desde la aplicación de este a sus datos, los sistemas de Plaid están diseñados para eliminar sus datos personales de forma automática, salvo determinadas excepciones en las que podremos conservar su información.

Las excepciones pueden ser: (a) si usted estableció una conexión con la aplicación de otro desarrollador a través de Plaid que sigue activa; (b) si Plaid necesita sus datos para seguir brindándole un servicio de Plaid que usted solicitó; (c) si por ley Plaid debe conservar sus datos; (d) si Plaid necesita sus datos para ayudar a prevenir el fraude o proteger la privacidad, brindar soporte o investigar el uso o la conducta indebidos; (e) cuando Plaid haya anonimizado sus datos, de modo que no puedan volver a permitir la identificación; o (f) si le solicitamos que nos permita conservar sus datos por más tiempo y usted específicamente lo acepta.

Sus datos únicamente serán tratados según lo exija la ley o de conformidad con esta Política.

Le recomendamos que consulte la sección “Sus derechos en materia de protección de datos” de esta Política para conocer las opciones que puedan estar disponibles para usted, lo que incluye cómo solicitar la eliminación de sus datos. En la sección “Sus controles de su privacidad” de esta Política también se brindan detalles sobre las herramientas que tiene a su disposición, para ayudarlo a visualizar y administrar las conexiones que ha realizado a través de Plaid. También puede contactarnos en relación con nuestras prácticas de conservación de datos, usando la información de contacto en la sección “Cómo ponerse en contacto con Plaid”, más adelante.

##### Protección de datos

Las políticas y prácticas de seguridad de Plaid están diseñadas para proteger la confidencialidad e integridad de sus datos. Plaid implementa controles creados para limitar el acceso a estos datos al personal que tiene un motivo comercial para conocerlos, y prohíbe al personal acceder a estos datos, divulgarlos o utilizarlos ilícitamente.

##### Algunos detalles finales

##### Transferencias internacionales de datos

Operamos a nivel internacional y, por consiguiente, transferimos los datos que recabamos acerca de usted a través de fronteras internacionales para el tratamiento y almacenamiento (por ejemplo, transferimos datos desde el EEE y el RU a los Estados Unidos, y almacenamos datos en regiones de AWS ubicadas en los Estados Unidos). Al transferir datos a un país o territorio diferente, respetamos las leyes aplicables sobre protección de datos. En particular, cuando transferimos datos desde el EEE o el RU a través de otras fronteras internacionales, nos basamos en las decisiones de adecuación, acuerdos sobre transferencia de datos u otros mecanismos aprobados por la Comisión Europea o la Secretaría de Estado del Reino Unido (según corresponda) para dichas transferencias, incluidas las cláusulas contractuales tipo. Puede solicitar una copia de esas cláusulas contractuales tipo contactándonos según se indica debajo. Antes de transferir datos desde el EEE o el RU, realizamos evaluaciones del impacto de las transferencias e implementamos las medidas complementarias necesarias para garantizar que los datos transferidos sean conservados de conformidad con los requisitos impuestos por el EEE y el RU.

##### Sus derechos en materia de protección de datos

##### Resumen de las actividades de tratamiento por producto

Como se mencionó anteriormente, los datos que recabamos y usamos dependen de los productos y servicios de Plaid que usted y el desarrollador usan. Para facilitar la comprensión de qué datos se recaban y usan para cada producto y servicio, hemos elaborado los siguientes resúmenes sobre nuestra recopilación y uso de datos por producto. Algunos de estos productos únicamente están disponibles para los usuarios que se encuentran en los EE. UU. y otros solamente para usuarios que se encuentran en el EEE y el RU. Si no está seguro de cuáles productos o servicios de Plaid usan las aplicaciones a las que está conectado, le solicitamos que se comunique con el desarrollador de la aplicación. (Tenga en cuenta que esta lista refleja el conjunto de productos de Plaid a partir de la fecha de entrada en vigencia de esta Política y podría no incluir productos o servicios en desarrollo a partir de esa fecha).

Además, la ley de protección de datos de algunas jurisdicciones, como el Reino Unido y la UE, diferencia entre el “responsable de controlar el tratamiento” y el “encargado del tratamiento” de los datos. En función del producto o servicio que usted y su desarrollador utilicen, Plaid puede ser el responsable de controlar el tratamiento o el encargado del tratamiento de los datos recabados en virtud de la ley de protección de datos pertinente. A menos que se especifique lo contrario en la descripción del producto a continuación, Plaid es el responsable de controlar el tratamiento de los datos personales recabados.

Utilizamos estos datos tal como se describe en la sección [Cómo usamos sus datos](#como-usamos-sus-datos) de esta Política.

##### Auth (Autenticación)

Le permite autenticar los datos de su cuenta financiera y brindar acceso a su cuenta y números de ruta (routing number) a Plaid y a las aplicaciones y servicios que usted elija.

##### Ten eerste, wat achtergrond

_Een korte opmerking over Plaid_

Onze missie bij Plaid is het verwezenlijken van financiële vrijheid voor iedereen. Door toegang te bieden tot hoogwaardige, bruikbare financiële rekeninggegevens die wij vertaald en gestandaardiseerd hebben, stellen wij ontwikkelaars van financiële apps en diensten in staat om zich te richten op het bouwen van ervaringen waar u van profiteert.

_Over dit Beleid_

Ons doel met dit Beleid is om een eenvoudige en duidelijke uitleg te geven over welke gegevens Plaid van en over u verzamelt en hoe we die informatie gebruiken en delen. We waarderen transparantie en willen u een duidelijke en beknopte beschrijving geven van hoe we met uw gegevens omgaan.

Dit Beleid dekt niet wat ontwikkelaars van de apps die u gebruikt doen met uw gegevens. Raadpleeg de privacybeleidslijnen of de servicevoorwaarden voor die apps voor informatie over hun praktijken. Dit Beleid heeft ook geen betrekking op gegevens die we verzamelen via onze websites of wanneer u met Plaid communiceert buiten het gebruik van onze producten of diensten, zoals het rechtstreeks e-mailen naar Plaid. Raadpleeg onze [Privacyverklaring voor alle doelgroepen](#privacyverklaring) en ons [Cookiebeleid](#cookiebeleid) voor meer informatie.

De diensten van Plaid zijn niet gericht op personen jonger dan 18 jaar en we verzamelen niet bewust gegevens over kinderen.

##### Hoe wij omgaan met gegevens

Plaid zet zich in om eindgebruikers zinvolle controle over hun gegevens te bieden. Dit gedeelte beschrijft de gegevenspraktijken van Plaid met betrekking tot onze verwerking van data over u. We bieden ook samenvattingen van onze praktijken georganiseerd per categorie van verzamelde gegevens en per product aan het einde van dit Beleid in het gedeelte [Samenvattingen van Verwerkingsactiviteiten](#samenvattingen-van-verwerkingsactiviteiten).

##### Gegevens die wij verzamelen en broncategorieën

Zoals hieronder in meer detail wordt uitgelegd, hangen de gegevens die we verzamelen, gebruiken en delen af van de producten en diensten van Plaid die u, en/of de app waarmee u verbonden bent, gebruikt. Afhankelijk van de producten of diensten van Plaid die u of de ontwikkelaar waarmee u verbinding maakt, gebruikt, kan Plaid de volgende gegevens verzamelen:

* Gegevens van de ontwikkelaar van de app waarmee u verbinding hebt gemaakt; en
    
* Gegevens van onze gelieerde ondernemingen om u ondersteuning te bieden of om u een betere gebruikerservaring te bieden; en/of

* informatie uit **documenten of afschriften**die u aan Plaid verstrekt, zoals bankafschriften of salarisafschriften.
    

Wanneer u inloggegevens en aanvullende informatie verstrekt die nodig zijn om uw rekeningen te koppelen, geeft u Plaid ook toestemming en autoriteit om namens u te handelen om toegang te krijgen tot gegevens en deze te verzenden van en naar uw financiële instelling.

**Gegevens die we verzamelen van financiële instellingen over en van uw rekeningen.** Afhankelijk van welke producten of diensten van Plaid u, of de ontwikkelaar van uw app gebruikt, en welke, en hoe informatie beschikbaar wordt gesteld, kunnen wij de volgende gegevens van uw financiële instellingen verzamelen:

* **Rekeninggegevens**,waaronder de naam van de financiële instelling, de naam van de rekening, het type rekening, de eigenaar van de rekening, het filiaalnummer, de IBAN, de BIC, het rekeningnummer, het routeringsnummer en de sorteercode;
    
* **Gegevens over een rekeningsaldo**, inclusief huidig en beschikbaar saldo;
    
* **Gegevens over kredietrekeningen**, waaronder vervaldata, verschuldigde saldi, betalingsbedragen en -data, transactiegeschiedenis, kredietlimiet, aflossingsstatus en rentevoet;

Afhankelijk van de dienst van Plaid die u of de ontwikkelaar van uw app gebruikt, en de manier waarop de gegevens beschikbaar worden gesteld, kunnen de verzamelde gegevens van uw financiële rekeningen gegevens bevatten van alle rekeningen (bijv. betaalrekeningen, spaarrekeningen, creditcardrekeningen en gezamenlijke rekeningen) die toegankelijk zijn via één set rekeninggegevens. Voor meer bijzonderheden over gegevens die worden verzameld in verband met verschillende producten en diensten, verwijzen wij u naar [Samenvatting van verwerkingsactiviteiten per product](#samenvatting-van-verwerkingsactiviteiten-per-product)

**Gegevens we ontvangen vanaf uw apparaten.**Wanneer u een apparaat gebruikt, zoals uw smartphone, tablet of computer, voor interactie met onze diensten (inclusief via een app van een ontwikkelaar), kunnen wij de volgende gegevens over dat apparaat verzamelen:

* internetprotocol (IP)-adres;
    
* tijdzone-instelling en locatie van het apparaat;
    
* hardwaremodel en besturingssysteem;
    
* functies binnen onze diensten waartoe u toegang hebt;
    
* browsergegevens;
    
* netwerkgegevens; en
    
* andere technische gegevens over het apparaat (zoals instellingen en voorkeuren).
    

**Gegevens die we ontvangen over u van de ontwikkelaars van apps aangedreven door Plaid.** Wanneer het nodig is voor Plaid om een dienst te verlenen (zoals het verifiëren van uw identiteit, het beschermen tegen fraude of risico's, of het mogelijk maken van een bankoverschrijving), kunnen de ontwikkelaars van de apps die u gebruikt ons identificatoren en commerciële informatie over u verstrekken, zoals uw naam, Burgerservicenummer, e-mailadres, telefoonnummer, of informatie over uw financiële rekeningen en transacties.

**Gegevens van onze gelieerde ondernemingen om u ondersteuning te bieden of om u een betere gebruikerservaring te bieden.** We kunnen gegevens verzamelen van onze gelieerde ondernemingen (dit zijn bedrijven die met ons verbonden zijn door gemeenschappelijk eigendom of zeggenschap) om u ondersteuning te bieden of uw ervaring te verbeteren. Als u er bijvoorbeeld voor kiest dat Plaid CRA financiële rekeningen in verband met uw telefoonnummer onthoudt, kunnen wij de volgende gegevens van Plaid CRA verzamelen om u te helpen sneller verbinding te maken met uw rekeningen wanneer u onze diensten gebruikt:

* **identificatiegegevens** zoals naam, e-mailadres en telefoonnummer;
    
* **aanmeldingsgegevens** indien dit door de aanbieder van uw rekening wordt voorgeschreven, zoals uw gebruikersnaam en wachtwoord, banknaam, rekening- en routeringsnummer, of een beveiligingstoken;
    
* indien nodig, **gegevens om uw identiteit te helpen verifiëren en uw rekeningen te koppelen**, waaronder uw geboortedatum, beveiligingsvragen en -antwoorden en een eenmalig wachtwoord (OTP); en/of gegevens van uw apparaat (zoals hierboven in meer detail uitgelegd).
    
* gegevens van uw apparaat (zoals hierboven in meer detail uitgelegd).
    

**Gegevens die we over u ontvangen uit andere bronnen.** Wanneer dit nodig is om een dienst te verlenen, uw apparaat te identificeren of fraude, misbruik of veiligheidsrisico's te helpen voorkomen, kunnen wij ook rechtstreeks gegevens over u ontvangen van derden, waaronder uw draadloze provider, agenten en onze dienstverleners.

**Informatie we afleiden van de gegevens die we verzamelen.** We kunnen aanvullende informatie over u afleiden uit de gegevens die we verzamelen. Wij kunnen bijvoorbeeld uw geolocatie, jaarinkomen of het type rekening of subrekening dat u hebt gekozen om te koppelen afleiden – bijvoorbeeld wanneer u uw leningsrekeningen koppelt, zodat wij de ontwikkelaar kunnen laten weten of de rekening voor een hypotheek, studentenlening of creditcard is.

* **Diensten verlenen:** Om onze diensten uit te voeren, te leveren en te onderhouden.

##### Onze rechtsgronden voor verwerking (uitsluitend eindgebruikers in de EER en het Verenigd Koninkrijk)

Voor personen in de Europese Economische Ruimte (“EER”) of het Verenigd Koninkrijk (“VK”), verwerkt Plaid uw persoonsgegevens alleen wanneer we een geldige rechtsgrond hebben om dit te doen. Onze rechtsgrondslag voor het verwerken van de gegevens die we verzamelen, is afhankelijk van welke gegevens we hebben verzameld en het doel van de verwerking. In het algemeen zullen wij uw gegevens alleen verzamelen en verwerken wanneer:

* wij moeten voldoen aan een contract of overeenkomst met u (bijvoorbeeld om te voldoen aan onze overeenkomsten voor eindgebruikersdiensten) en moeten ons houden aan verschillende wettelijke voorschriften bij het aanbieden van gereguleerde diensten, waaronder onze rekeninginformatie en betalingsdiensten.
    
* we uw gegevens nodig hebben om te voldoen aan onze wettelijke verplichtingen onder de toepasselijke wetgeving, om de wettelijke rechten van Plaid te waarborgen en om criminele activiteiten zoals het witwassen van geld en fraude te voorkomen en te identificeren. Voor deze doeleinden kan Plaid het noodzakelijk vinden om uw persoonsgegevens te delen met entiteiten zoals rechtbanken, wetshandhavingsinstanties en aanbieders van antiwitwasdiensten;
    
* verwerking is noodzakelijk voor onze legitieme belangen om de integriteit van onze diensten effectief te handhaven. Dit omvat het ophalen van rekeninginformatie of het verlenen van betalingsinitiatiediensten (evenals het verifiëren van de output van deze activiteit), het aangaan van communicatie met u en het ervoor zorgen dat Plaid, als een gereglementeerde entiteit, de verwachte normen naleeft (waaronder die zijn vastgelegd door de Financial Conduct Authority voor Plaid Financial Ltd en De Nederlandsche Bank voor Plaid B.V); of
    
* u hiervoor uw toestemming hebt gegeven.
    

Voor zover wij vertrouwen op toestemming om uw gegevens te verzamelen en te verwerken, hebt u het recht om uw toestemming op elk gewenst moment in te trekken volgens de instructies in dit Beleid.

##### Hoe we uw gegevens delen

We delen uw gegevens om de volgende redenen:

* Met de ontwikkelaar van de app die u gebruikt en zoals aangegeven door die ontwikkelaar;
    
* Om een contract met u uit te voeren;
    
* Met onze gegevensverwerkers en andere dienstverleners, partners, agenten of contractanten in verband met de diensten die zij voor ons of voor ontwikkelaars uitvoeren;
    
* Met financiële instellingen om een koppeling die u hebt gekozen tussen uw rekeningen bij een financiële instelling en een app tot stand te brengen, te onderhouden of te beheren;
    
* Als wij in goed vertrouwen geloven dat openbaarmaking gepast is om te voldoen aan de toepasselijke wet- en regelgeving of een juridisch proces (zoals een gerechtelijk bevel of dagvaarding);
    
* In verband met een verandering in eigenaarschap of controle van ons bedrijf of een deel ervan (zoals een fusie, overname, reorganisatie of faillissement);
    
* Tussen en binnen Plaid en onze huidige en toekomstige moedermaatschappijen, gelieerde bedrijven, dochterondernemingen en andere bedrijven onder gemeenschappelijke controle of eigenaarschap;
    
* Zoals wij redelijkerwijs passend achten om kwaadwillige of frauduleuze activiteiten te voorkomen, of op andere wijze de rechten, privacy, veiligheid of eigendommen van u, ontwikkelaars, onze partners, Plaid en anderen te beschermen; of
    
* Voor elk ander aangemeld doel met uw toestemming of op uw aanwijzing.
    

(Voor gebruikers in de VS) Wij delen uw gegevens niet met niet-gelieerde derden, tenzij dit wettelijk is toegestaan (zoals toegestaan door 12 C.F.R. § 1016.14 en 1016.15).

Wanneer u uw financiële rekeningen koppelt via Plaid, gebruiken we doorgaans de reCaptcha-dienst van Google om fraude en misbruik te helpen detecteren. Google reCAPTCHA is geïntegreerd in de producten en diensten van Plaid om ervoor te zorgen dat invoer in bijvoorbeeld online formulieren daadwerkelijk door echte personen wordt gedaan en niet door geautomatiseerde software (of bots).

Google reCAPTCHA analyseert het gedrag van gebruikers van onze producten en services aan de hand van verschillende kenmerken. Google reCAPTCHA verwerkt persoonsgegevens zoals uw IP-adres, uw verblijfsduur op onze website en verdere informatie over uw gebruik van de producten en diensten van Plaid. Deze gegevens worden door Google verzonden en opgeslagen op servers in de Verenigde Staten en andere landen. Google heeft zich gecertificeerd voor het EU-VS Data Privacy Framework; het certificaat is [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active) beschikbaar. Wanneer reCAPTCHA wordt gebruikt, zijn het Privacybeleid en de Gebruiksvoorwaarden van Google van toepassing op reCAPTCHA en informatie die Google verzamelt via reCAPTCHA.

We delen uw persoonlijke financiële gegevens alleen met derden om de door u gevraagde diensten te ondersteunen, wanneer u toestemming geeft en/of ter bescherming tegen fraude.

We kunnen cookiegegevens verzamelen en delen met derden wanneer u onze website bezoekt, of we kunnen derden toestaan om deze cookiegegevens van onze websites te verzamelen. Raadpleeg ons [Cookiebeleid](#cookiebeleid) en het [Privacybeleid](#privacyverklaring) voor alle doelgroepen voor meer informatie.

##### Onze bewaar- en verwijderingspraktijken

Wij bewaren uw gegevens alleen zo lang als nodig is. Om te bepalen of de gegevens nodig zijn, houden we rekening met de reden waarom uw gegevens zijn verzameld en gebruikt en eventuele wettelijke voorschriften om uw gegevens te bewaren. We beoordelen uw gegevens periodiek om ervoor te zorgen dat ze nog steeds nodig zijn om te voldoen aan het doel waarvoor ze zijn verzameld of aan andere wettelijke verplichtingen. Als een ontwikkelaar uw verbinding van hun app met uw gegevens verwijdert, zijn de systemen van Plaid ontworpen om uw persoonsgegevens automatisch te verwijderen, behoudens bepaalde uitzonderingen waar we uw informatie nog steeds kunnen bewaren.

Uitzonderingen hierop kunnen zijn als: (a) u via Plaid een verbinding met de app van een andere ontwikkelaar tot stand hebt gebracht die nog steeds actief is; (b) Plaid uw gegevens nodig heeft om u te blijven voorzien van een dienst van Plaid die u hebt aangevraagd; (c) Plaid wettelijk verplicht is om uw gegevens te bewaren; (d) Plaid uw gegevens nodig heeft om fraude te helpen voorkomen of de privacy te beschermen, ondersteuning te bieden of misbruik en wangedrag te onderzoeken; (e) Plaid uw gegevens zodanig heeft geanonimiseerd dat ze niet opnieuw geïdentificeerd kunnen worden of (f) wij vragen – en u gaat er specifiek mee akkoord – om ons toe te staan uw gegevens langer te bewaren.

Uw gegevens worden alleen verwerkt zoals voorgeschreven door de wet of in overeenstemming met dit Beleid.

Raadpleeg het gedeelte "Uw rechten voor gegevensbescherming" van dit Beleid voor de opties die voor u beschikbaar kunnen zijn, waaronder hoe u kunt verzoeken om uw gegevens te verwijderen. Het gedeelte "Uw privacybeheer" van dit Beleid bevat ook details over hulpmiddelen die voor u beschikbaar zijn om u te helpen bij het bekijken en beheren van de verbindingen die u met Plaid hebt gemaakt. U kunt ook contact met ons opnemen over onze praktijken voor het bewaren van gegevens met behulp van de contactgegevens in het gedeelte “Contact opnemen met Plaid” hieronder.

##### Bescherming van gegevens

Het beveiligingsbeleid en de beveiligingspraktijken van Plaid zijn ontworpen om de vertrouwelijkheid en integriteit van uw gegevens te beschermen. Plaid implementeert controles die ontworpen zijn om de toegang tot deze gegevens te beperken tot personeel dat een zakelijke reden heeft om deze gegevens te kennen en verbiedt zijn personeel om deze gegevens op onwettige wijze te openen, te gebruiken of openbaar te maken.

##### Enkele laatste details

##### Internationale gegevensoverdrachten

Wij opereren internationaal en daarom geven wij de gegevens die wij over u verzamelen over internationale grenzen door voor verwerking en opslag (wij geven bijvoorbeeld gegevens door van de EER en het VK naar de Verenigde Staten en slaan gegevens op in AWS-regio's in de Verenigde Staten). Wanneer we gegevens doorgeven naar een ander land of gebied volgen we daarbij de toepasselijke wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming. In het bijzonder wanneer we gegevens vanuit de EER of het VK over andere internationale grenzen heen doorgeven, vertrouwen we op adequaatheidsbesluiten, overeenkomsten voor gegevensdoorgifte of andere door de EU-Commissie of de Britse staatssecretaris goedgekeurde (indien van toepassing) mechanismen voor dergelijke doorgiften, waaronder standaard contractuele clausules. U kunt een kopie van genoemde standaardcontractbepalingen aanvragen door contact met ons op te nemen zoals aangegeven onderaan deze Verklaring. Voorafgaand aan de doorgifte van gegevens vanuit de EER of het Verenigd Koninkrijk voeren we effectbeoordelingen uit en implementeren we eventuele aanvullende maatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat alle overgedragen gegevens worden bewaard in overeenstemming met de voorschriften van de EER en het Verenigd Koninkrijk.

##### Uw rechten voor gegevensbescherming

Ongeacht waar u woont, zullen we de volgende rechten met betrekking tot uw persoonsgegevens respecteren, met inachtneming van enkele beperkingen en uitzonderingen die door de wet worden voorzien, en u wordt niet gediscrimineerd voor het uitoefenen ervan:

* toegang te krijgen tot gegevens die over u zijn verzameld;
    
* toegang vragen tot meer details over de categorieën en specifieke persoonsgegevens die wij in de afgelopen 12 maanden over u hebben verzameld (inclusief persoonsgegevens die voor zakelijke doeleinden zijn vrijgegeven);
    
* onder bepaalde omstandigheden verzoeken dat wij uw gegevens die onnauwkeurig of onvolledig zijn, corrigeren of bijwerken;
    
* onder bepaalde omstandigheden verzoeken dat wij uw gegevens te wissen of de verwerking ervan beperken;
    
* bezwaar te maken tegen onze verwerking van uw gegevens onder bepaalde voorwaarden die door de wet worden bepaald;
    
* wanneer de verwerking van uw gegevens is gebaseerd op toestemming, dient u die toestemming in te trekken;
    
* verzoeken dat wij de over u verzamelde gegevens verstrekken in een gestructureerd, algemeen gebruikt en machinaal leesbaar formaat, zodat u deze kunt overdragen aan een ander bedrijf, indien dit technisch haalbaar is.
    
    * Houd er rekening mee dat u voor een officiële registratie van uw financiële informatie dat verzoek rechtstreeks bij uw financiële instelling moet indienen.
        
    

Afhankelijk van waar u woont, hebt u mogelijk het recht om een klacht in te dienen. We verwelkomen en waarderen de kans om eventuele zorgen die u hebt aan te pakken en moedigen u aan om contact met ons op te nemen. Bovendien, en afhankelijk van uw rechtsgebied, kunt u het recht hebben om op elk moment een klacht in te dienen bij uw (gegevensbeschermings-) toezichthoudende autoriteit. Voor eindgebruikers in de EER vindt u de contactgegevens van het Europees Comité voor gegevensbescherming (EDPB) op de website van het EDPB [heir](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). Voor eindgebruikers in het Verenigd Koninkrijk vindt u [heir](https://ico.org.uk/) de contactgegevens van het Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) op de website van het ICO. Voor eindgebruikers in Zwitserland is dit de Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner die u [heir](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html) kunt vinden.

Om rechten uit te oefenen, kunt u een verzoek indienen via ons [online formulier](https://plaid.com/legal/data-protection-request-form-nl). U kunt ook contact met ons opnemen zoals beschreven in het gedeelte "Contact opnemen met Plaid" hieronder om uw rechten op het gebied van gegevensbescherming uit te oefenen. Het kan zijn dat u aanvullende gegevens moet verstrekken om uw identiteit te bevestigen voordat wij op uw verzoek kunnen reageren.

Wanneer wij uw verzoek ontvangen van een gevolmachtigde agent, kunnen wij om bewijs vragen dat de agent een geldige schriftelijke machtiging heeft, zoals een volmacht, om namens u verzoeken in te dienen.

We zullen verzoeken in overweging nemen en ons antwoord geven binnen een redelijke termijn (en binnen een door de toepasselijke wetgeving voorgeschreven termijn). Wij wijzen u er echter op dat bepaalde gegevens van dergelijke verzoeken kunnen worden vrijgesteld, bijvoorbeeld als wij de gegevens moeten bewaren om aan onze eigen wettelijke verplichtingen te voldoen of om rechtsvorderingen in te stellen, uit te oefenen of te verdedigen.

Voor zowel Plaid Financial Ltd. als Plaid B.V. hebben wij een functionaris voor gegevensbescherming (DPO) aangesteld, die ook verantwoordelijk is voor het toezicht op vragen met betrekking tot dit Beleid en waarmee contact kan worden opgenomen via e-mail op [privacy@plaid.com](mailto:privacy@plaid.com).

##### Uw extra privacycontroles

Plaid heeft het [Plaid Portal](http://my.plaid.com/) ontwikkeld om u een handige, gecentraliseerde manier te bieden om de verbindingen die u met Plaid hebt gemaakt te bekijken en te beheren.

Als u in de VS gevestigd bent, dan kunt u een Plaid Portal-account aanmaken door naar my.plaid.com te gaan, uw telefoonnummer en e-mailadres te verifiëren en een wachtwoord aan te maken. Zodra u zich hebt aangemeld voor het Plaid Portal, wordt u naar een dashboard geleid dat u financiële rekeningen kan laten zien die u via Plaid met de door u gekozen apps hebt verbonden, en de soorten gegevens die met die apps worden gedeeld. Bovendien biedt het Plaid Portal u controles om de verbinding tussen apps en uw financiële rekeningen te beëindigen en bijbehorende gegevens die zijn opgeslagen in de systemen van Plaid te verwijderen.

##### Wijzigingen in dit Beleid

We kunnen dit Beleid van tijd tot tijd bijwerken of wijzigen. Als we updates of wijzigingen aanbrengen, plaatsen we het nieuwe beleid op de website van Plaid op [https://plaid.com/legal](https://plaid.com/legal) en werken we de ingangsdatum bovenaan dit Beleid bij. Wij zullen ontwikkelaars ook op de hoogte stellen van materiële wijzigingen in overeenstemming met onze overeenkomsten met ontwikkelaars, aangezien zij beter in staat kunnen zijn om u op de hoogte te stellen van wijzigingen in dit Beleid.

##### Samenvatting van verwerkingsactiviteiten per product

Zoals hierboven vermeld, zijn de gegevens die we verzamelen en gebruiken afhankelijk van de producten en diensten van Plaid die u en de ontwikkelaar gebruiken. Om het makkelijker te maken om te begrijpen welke gegevens voor welk(e) product en service worden verzameld en gebruikt, hebben we de onderstaande samenvattingen van onze gegevensverzameling en -gebruik per product samengesteld. Sommige van deze producten zijn alleen beschikbaar voor gebruikers in de VS en andere zijn alleen beschikbaar voor gebruikers in de EER en het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Als u niet zeker weet welke Plaid-producten of -diensten uw verbonden toepassingen gebruiken, neem dan contact op met de ontwikkelaar van de toepassing. (Let erop dat deze lijst de productsuite van Plaid weergeeft vanaf de ingangsdatum van dit Beleid en mogelijk geen producten of diensten bevat die op die datum in ontwikkeling zijn.)

Daarnaast maakt de wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming in bepaalde rechtsgebieden, zoals het VK en de EU, onderscheid tussen de “verwerkingsverantwoordelijke” en “verwerker” van gegevens. Afhankelijk van welk(e) product of dienst u en uw ontwikkelaar gebruiken, kan Plaid de verwerkingsverantwoordelijke of de verwerker zijn van de gegevens die zijn verzameld onder de relevante wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming. Tenzij anders vermeld in de onderstaande productbeschrijving, is Plaid de verwerkingsverantwoordelijke van de verzamelde persoonsgegevens.

Identiteitsverificatie en -controle (IDV) maken identiteitsverificatie, fraudedetectie en controlediensten voor ontwikkelaars mogelijk. Wanneer we diensten voor identiteitsverificatie en -controle leveren aan ontwikkelaars, verzamelen en verwerken we alleen uw gegevens als dienstverlener aan die ontwikkelaar, zodat de ontwikkelaars het doel en de middelen bepalen waarmee uw gegevens worden verwerkt. Ga voor meer informatie over hoe we eindgebruikersgegevens verwerken voor ontwikkelaars en over de instructie van de ontwikkelaar om identiteitsverificatie- en monitoringsdiensten te leveren naar de [Privacyverklaring voor eindgebruikers](https://cognitohq.com/privacy-statement) van IDV.

##### Zunächst einige Hintergrundinformationen

_Eine kurze Erläuterung zu Plaid_

Unser Leitmotiv bei Plaid ist es, finanzielle Freiheit für alle zu ermöglichen. Indem wir den Zugang zu qualitativ hochwertigen, nutzbaren Finanzkontodaten eröffnen, die wir strukturiert und standardisiert haben, können sich die Entwickler von Finanz-Apps und Finanzdienstleistungen auf die Entwicklung von Anwendungen konzentrieren, die Ihnen zugutekommen.

Weitere Informationen finden Sie in unserer [Datenschutzerklärung für alle Zielgruppen](#all-audiences) und der [Cookie-Richtlinie](#cookie-richtlinie).

Wir überprüfen Ihre Daten regelmäßig in Hinblick darauf, ob jene noch für Zweck, für den sie erhoben wurden, oder für andere gesetzliche Erfordernisse benötigt werden. Wenn ein Entwickler Ihre Verbindung in seiner App zu Ihren Daten unterbricht, sind die Systeme von Plaid so konzipiert, dass sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten automatisch löschen. Das geschieht vorbehaltlich bestimmter Ausnahmen, in denen wir Ihre Daten weiterhin aufbewahren können.

Ausgenommen hiervon sind unter Umständen Fälle, in denen: (a) Sie eine Verbindung zu der App eines anderen Entwicklers über Plaid hergestellt haben, die noch aktiv ist; (b) Plaid Ihre Daten zur weiteren Bereitstellung eines von Ihnen angeforderten Plaid-Dienstes benötigt; (c) Plaid gesetzlich verpflichtet ist, Ihre Daten zu speichern; (d) Plaid Ihre Daten zur Verhinderung von Betrug oder zum Schutz der Privatsphäre, zur Leistung von Support oder zur Untersuchung von Missbrauch und Fehlverhalten benötigt, (e) sofern Plaid Ihre Daten anonymisiert hat, sodass eine Re-Identifizierung damit nicht möglich ist, oder (e) wir Sie bitten, uns zu erlauben – und Sie dem ausdrücklich zustimmen –, Ihre Daten länger aufzubewahren.

Ihre Daten werden nur so verarbeitet, wie es gesetzlich vorgeschrieben oder in dieser Erklärung vorgesehen ist.

Account information services

2.5. Plaid's account information services allow you to access and view information relating to your selected Payment Account within the Plaid dashboard (available at [https://my.plaid.com/](https://my.plaid.com/) ) and the Application through which you have accessed our Services.

2.6. To access the Plaid dashboard, you need to create an account with Plaid. You also need to ensure that your information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You must follow best practices to help secure your Plaid account and notify us if you learn of any unauthorised access to or use of your Plaid account.

2.7. With your explicit consent, we access and display information relating to your selected Payment Account(s) ("**Account Information**") within the Plaid dashboard and transmit such information to the Application through which you have accessed our Services. Such information may include: a. financial transaction history, for example, transaction amount, data, description and currency; b. financial account details, for example, account number, type, currency and balance; and c. financial account holder information, for example, name, address, phone number, and email address.

2.8. Before receiving Plaid's account information service, you will have instructed the Application through which you have accessed our Services to retrieve your Account Information using Plaid. Upon such an instruction, you will generally be redirected to us.

2.9. Once you are redirected to us, we will ask you to select which Payment Account provider ("**Account** **Provider**") you would like us to access Account Information from. You will give your explicit consent to us: (i) accessing your Account Information from the Account Provider you have selected; and (ii) taking the steps outlined in clause paragraph 2.12. once we have accessed your Account Information. Plaid will request your Account Information from your Account Provider on a periodic basis in accordance with your consent until the consent expires or is withdrawn.

2.10. Please note, you may be redirected to your Account Provider's website or mobile application in order to authenticate yourself so that your Account Provider knows that you consent to us accessing your Account Information.

2.11. Alternatively, in some circumstances, we may ask you to provide us with the login details for your Payment Account. By providing us with your Payment Account login details, you confirm that you have all the necessary rights, permissions and authority to share your login details and Account Information with us, and you grant us explicit consent to use your login details to access your Payment Account to obtain the necessary Account Information on your behalf and at your direction in order to provide you with the Services.

2.12. Once we have accessed your Account Information we may: a. share your Account Information with the Application through which you have accessed our Services; b. share your Account Information with third parties as directed by the Application through which you have accessed our Services provided, however, that you have explicitly consent to such sharing; or c. display your Account Information on the Plaid dashboard.

2.13. You agree to us sharing the Account Information we have accessed from your Account Provider with the Application through which you have accessed our Services, and with third parties as directed by that Application provided that in both cases you have explicitly consented to such sharing. Such sharing allows the Application to provide you with products and services in accordance with the Application Terms.

2.14. We do not check the accuracy of the Account Information retrieved from your Account Provider and we rely on your Account Provider to ensure that your Account Information is up to date and accurate.

2.15. We may standardize, categorize, merge, aggregate, and otherwise process your Account Information before displaying your Account Information on the Plaid dashboard, sharing it with the Application through which you have accessed our Services, or sharing it with third parties as directed by that Application with your explicit consent.

2.16. You may withdraw or vary your consent for Plaid to provide account information services at any time.

Payment initiation services

2.17. Plaid's payment initiation service allows you to make online payments from your Payment Account(s). Plaid can initiate the following types of online payments from your Payment Account(s): (i) single payments; (ii) standing orders; and (iii) variable recurring payments.

Single Payments

2.18. Before receiving our payment initiation service in respect of a single online payment order, you will have instructed the Application through which you have accessed our Services to make a single online payment using Plaid. You will be asked to review and confirm your payment order details for the single online payment, including: (i) the payment amount and (ii) the recipient details. It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the payment order details are correct before you confirm the payment order. You may not be able to recover a payment to an incorrect account or recipient.

2.19. These details will be pre-populated for you to review and confirm. For example, where you use Plaid payment initiation services to purchase goods or services online you must ensure that the merchant recipient details are correct.

2.20. You will confirm the payment order and provide explicit consent for Plaid to send the payment order to your Account Provider for execution, to receive information from your Account Provider on the initiation and execution of the payment order and to pass this information on to the Application through which you accessed our Services.

2.21. When you use Plaid's payment initiation service you will be asked to select the Payment Account from which you will fund the payment and you may be redirected to your Account Provider's website or mobile application in order to authenticate yourself so that your Account Provider knows that you consent to the transaction.

2.22. If the payment order relates to a transaction that is to be executed by your Account Provider immediately, you will not be able to cancel the payment order once you have provided your confirmation and explicit consent in accordance with paragraph 2.20.

2.23. If the Application through which you accessed our Services supports refunds, the following provisions apply: At the time we submit the payment order to your Account Provider for execution, we shall ask the Account Provider to share your name, Payment Account sort code and account number or IBAN ("**Account Details**") with us. If you require a refund for the payment made using Plaid's payment initiation services, you must request the refund from the Application through which you accessed our Services. The Application will in turn notify us that you have requested a refund and we will share your Account Details with the Application in order for them to make the refund to your Payment Account (i.e. the Payment Account used to fund the original payment). The Application (and not Plaid) is responsible for making the refund. Plaid accepts no liability for the accuracy of your Account Details provided to us by your Account Provider.

Standing Orders

2.24. You can use Plaid's payment initiation service to submit a standing order to your Account Provider. A standing order is an instruction to your Account Provider to make regular, recurring payments of the same amount to the same recipient over a specified or indefinite period of time.

2.25. If you use Plaid's payment initiation service to submit a standing order you will be asked to confirm: (i) the amount of the periodic payment, (ii) the recipient of the payments, (iii) the payment start date, (iv) the interval of the payment (e.g. every week or every month) (v) the day on which the payment should be made (e.g. the day of the week or month) and (vi) the end date or that the payments will continue unless cancelled.

2.26. Once you have confirmed the standing order details, you will be redirected to your bank to authenticate yourself and Plaid will submit the standing order instruction to your Account Provider.

2.27. Once the standing order has been confirmed as received by your Account Provider, Plaid no longer has control over the execution of the standing order payments; this is the responsibility of your Account Provider.

2.28. You will be able to view your standing order via your Account Provider's online banking facility (where supported). If you wish to change or cancel a standing order, you must do so directly with your Account Provider before the deadline provided by your Account Provider and before the next payment is due. If you miss the deadline for cancelling or amending your standing order, your Account Provider may not be able to stop the next payment in time.

2.29. For further information on how you can cancel and amend standing orders you should refer to your Account Provider terms and conditions.

Variable Recurring Payments

2.30. Before receiving our payment initiation service to make variable recurring payments, you will have instructed the Application through which you have accessed our Services to make a payment order for a series of payment transactions to the same payee using Plaid (Variable Recurring Payments).

2.31. You will be asked to set up a mandate for the Variable Recurring Payments. This is your consent to Plaid to initiate a series of payments which fall within agreed consent parameters which are set by you, which may include: (i) the maximum amount per payment (ii) the frequency of the payments (iii) the maximum amount per frequency (e.g. no more than £50 per day/week/month/year) and (iv) the expiry date of the payment order (VRP Mandate). These details will either be pre-populated for you to review and confirm or you will be able to manually select your limits within the consent parameters. It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the details in the VRP Mandate are correct. You may not be able to recover a payment made pursuant to a VRP Mandate if any details are not correct to an incorrect account or recipient.

2.32. You will confirm any details required in setting up the VRP Mandate and provide explicit consent for Plaid to: (i) send those details to your Account Provider; (ii) access your Payment Account; (iii) initiate payment transactions in accordance with the VRP Mandate; (iv) receive information from your Account Provider on the initiation and execution of your instructions; and (v) to pass this information on to the Application through which you accessed our Services.

2.33. When you set up a VRP Mandate you will be asked to select the Payment Account from which you will fund the Variable Recurring Payments and you will be redirected to your Account Provider's website or mobile application in order to authenticate yourself so that your Account Provider knows that you consent to the VRP Mandate and to Variable Recurring Payments being made under the VRP Mandate.

2.34. Once your Account Provider has confirmed authentication, either Plaid or the Application through which you accessed our Services will confirm to you that the VRP Mandate has been successfully set up. Plaid will then initiate payments under the VRP Mandate in accordance with payment requests made by the Application through which you have accessed our Services. Plaid will only initiate a payment under a VRP Mandate where the payment is within the parameters set by you in the VRP Mandate.

2.35. You will be able to view and manage your VRP Mandate through your Account Provider, the Application and Plaid. If you wish to withdraw your VRP Mandate then you can do so with your Account Provider, the Application or Plaid directly. For further information on how you can withdraw your VRP Mandate through your Account Provider, you should refer to your Account Provider terms and conditions.

**3\. Eligibility and Availability**

3.1. You can only use the Services if:

* (a) you are 18 or over;
* (b) your Payment Account and Account Provider are located in the UK;
* (c) you provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information, and do not misrepresent your identity or any other information about you;

3.2. The Services that are available and the manner in which the Services are delivered may vary depending on the type of device you are using, the type of Payment Account(s) you have, the Account Terms and the Application Terms.

**4\. Communication**

4.1. Where relevant, Plaid may send you information and notifications to your email address or mobile number via SMS where Plaid considers this appropriate.

You must contact your Account Provider in the manner set out in the applicable Account Terms.

5.3. You should be aware that your Account Provider may contact you directly (and not through Plaid or the Application through which you have accessed our Services) if there is an issue with a payment order submitted through Plaid for whatever reason (for example, if there are insufficient funds or an issue with your authorisation). You may need to resolve such matters directly with your Account Provider.

**6\. Data**

6.1. We use your information in line with our End User Privacy Policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) which can be found on our website at [https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy](#end-user-privacy-policy).

7.3. Nothing excludes or limits our liability for: a. death or personal injury caused by our negligence; b. our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or c. a deliberate breach of this Agreement in a major way that is designed to harm you.

#### Plaid Short Message Service (SMS) Terms

Effective Date: December 1, 2023

Plaid Inc. (“**Plaid**”) is a financial technology company that securely transfers your financial data from your bank to your apps. Plaid may send you Short Message Service (SMS) messages in order to provide a service to you and/or to confirm your identity by way of two-factor authentication. By agreeing to these SMS terms (“**SMS Terms**”), you consent to receive automated SMS messages from Plaid, and any of our SMS-related service providers (“**service providers**”), including through the use of an automatic telephone dialing system, at the telephone number you have provided. Message and data rates may apply. As a general matter, you will receive one message, per request. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

By agreeing to these SMS Terms, you authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to Plaid or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help Plaid or our service provider identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. Please see our [End User Privacy Policy](#end-user-privacy-policy) to see how we treat your data.

The information your wireless carrier may disclose may include mobile number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, and mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI). No mobile information will be shared with third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes. Text messaging originator opt-in data and consent information will not be shared with any third parties.

If you do not wish to receive SMS messages from Plaid or our service providers, or if you no longer want your wireless operator to share information about you with Plaid or our service providers, you agree to reply STOP to any SMS message from Plaid or sent on behalf of Plaid in order to opt out of the SMS message notifications. You may receive an additional SMS message confirming your decision to opt out. After opting out of SMS messages, you will no longer receive messages from Plaid or our service providers unless you subsequently request SMS messages from us or sign up for any of our services, such as a Plaid Account, that require sending you SMS messages.

#### Plaid Account Terms

Effective Date: December 1, 2023

**Background**. Thanks for using Plaid! Plaid is a service that helps consumers like you connect your financial accounts, share your financial data, verify your identity, make transfers and payments, and use other products and services involving your financial and identity data with your chosen applications that use Plaid (“**Apps**”).

**Additional Terms**. These Plaid Account terms (“**Plaid Account Terms**”) supplement and incorporate by reference the [End User Services Agreement (US)](#end-user-services-agreement-us) and together form an agreement between you and Plaid (the “**Agreement**”). **_Please review all terms in the [End User Services Agreement (US)](#end-user-services-agreement-us), including in particular the Sections titled Rights to the Platform, Our Disclaimers, Liabilities for our Platform, Dispute Resolution, and Notices. Plaid may modify the Agreement upon notice to you, as detailed in the last paragraph of the [End User Services Agreement (US)](#end-user-services-agreement-us), and acceptance of these modifications will be required to continue using your Plaid Account._**

**Plaid Account**. Plaid allows you to save and manage your financial account connections and identity verification data in an account with Plaid (“Plaid Account”). This lets you accelerate your onboarding onto and use of Apps that use Plaid, including faster account connection, data sharing, identity verification, transfers and payments you make using Apps, and other products and services you use involving your financial and identity data in those Apps. Note that a Plaid Account is not a transaction or asset account for purposes of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, does not store funds, and does not provide you with a means to initiate electronic fund transfers or other payments, but instead enables you to onboard onto and use Apps more quickly and easily.

When you connect one or more financial accounts to an App using Plaid, Plaid may ask you to provide and verify your phone number, email address, or other contact information in order to create your Plaid Account and remember each of your connections within your Plaid Account. When you verify your identity with an App through Plaid, Plaid may ask whether you want to save your identity data within your Plaid Account. By creating a Plaid Account, you authorize Plaid to retain and use your financial account connections and identity data in accordance with the Agreement and Plaid’s [End User Privacy Policy](#end-user-privacy-policy).

**How Your Account Works**. Saving identity data and financial account connections in your Plaid Account enables you to more quickly onboard onto and use your Apps’ products and services. When you return to use your data and connections with your Apps, your Plaid Account helps us accurately recognize you and complete faster identity verification and account linking for you without you having to re-enter all of your saved information for each App.

As part of enabling these faster processes for you through your Plaid Account, Plaid may: (a) share with Apps, our subsidiaries, and our service providers information about whether or not you have a Plaid Account, and, if you do, certain information from your Plaid Account in order for us and them to provide services to you, including: (i) the number and types of financial account connections in your Plaid Account, (ii) the types of identity data and documents in your Plaid Account, and (iii) the services and use cases that Apps provide to you that can be supported by the financial account connections and identity data in your Plaid Account; (b) contact you using information that you provide or that is available in your saved identity data or financial account connections, including to send security notifications to confirm activity on your Plaid Account and messages outlining steps for you to complete or troubleshoot the process of using Plaid to onboard and use your Apps; and (c) verify your data to protect against fraud, misrepresentation, unauthorized or suspicious activity, or other malicious behavior – data we receive from this verification process may be stored in your Plaid Account for use when you return to share identity data with other Apps.

For more information about Plaid’s collection, use, and sharing of personal information about you, including in connection with your Plaid Account, please review Plaid’s [End User Privacy Policy](#end-user-privacy-policy). The Agreement and Plaid’s [End User Privacy Policy](#end-user-privacy-policy) do not cover what Apps that you use do with your information. You should review the privacy policies and terms of service for those Apps for information about their practices.

**Managing and Deleting Your Account**. You can view and manage your Plaid Account at [my.plaid.com](https://my.plaid.com/) or by contacting [privacy@plaid.com](mailto:privacy@plaid.com). If you would like to delete your Plaid Account or have any questions about managing your Plaid Account or regarding your data rights, please contact [privacy@plaid.com](mailto:privacy@plaid.com).

**Your Use and Restrictions**. You may only use your Plaid Account to enable faster onboarding onto and use of the Apps that use Plaid. By creating or using a Plaid Account, you expressly agree to the Agreement and that: (a) all data you provide and all financial accounts you connect are your own or that you are an authorized user of those accounts; (b) all data you provide to verify your identity is complete and accurate; and (c) you will not (i) use or access anyone else’s Plaid Account or related data, (ii) use any Plaid Account or related data for any fraudulent, illegal or misleading purpose, (iii) modify, reverse engineer or seek to gain unauthorized access to any Plaid Account or related Plaid systems, (iv) bypass or circumvent measures designed to prevent or limit access to any part of any Plaid Account or related Plaid systems, (v) copy, modify or create derivative works of any Plaid Account or related Plaid systems in any manner not authorized by Plaid, (vi) access any Plaid Account or related Plaid systems for competitive purposes or publish any benchmark or performance information, or (vii) use any Plaid Account or related Plaid systems in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning thereof or interfere with, disrupt, or negatively affect other users.

You acknowledge and understand that you are responsible for the data that you save in your Plaid Account. You will not provide any data that is: (i) defamatory, abusive, harassing, threatening, or an invasion of a right or the privacy of another person; (ii) bigoted, hateful, or racially or otherwise offensive; (iii) violent, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise sexually explicit; (iv) trademarked or copyrighted content, or content that otherwise infringes on the intellectual property rights of another individual or company; or (v) otherwise harmful or can be reasonably expected to be harmful to any person or entity. Any unauthorized use of a Plaid Account is strictly prohibited and may result in deletion of your Plaid Account.

**Wireless Device and SMS Terms**. Plaid may send you Short Message Service (SMS) messages in order to provide a service to you and/or to confirm your identity by way of two-factor authentication. You consent to receive automated SMS messages from Plaid, and any of our SMS-related service providers, including through the use of an automatic telephone dialing system, at the telephone number you have provided. Message and data rates may apply. As a general matter, you will receive one message per request. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

You authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to Plaid or our service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help Plaid or our service provider identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. Please see our [End User Privacy Policy](#end-user-privacy-policy) to see how we treat your data.

The information your wireless carrier may disclose may include mobile number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, and mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI). No mobile information will be shared with third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes. Text messaging originator opt-in data and consent information will not be shared with any third parties.

If you do not wish to receive SMS messages from Plaid or our service providers, or if you no longer want your wireless operator to share information about you with Plaid or our service providers, you agree to reply STOP to any SMS message from Plaid or sent on behalf of Plaid in order to opt out of the SMS message notifications.

**Persons under the age of 18 may not create a Plaid Account**. By creating and using your Plaid Account, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years old or older. If you have reason to believe that a person under 18 years of age is using our Services, please contact us at [privacy@plaid.com](mailto:privacy@plaid.com) and, upon confirmation, we will delete the relevant Plaid Account, subject to and in compliance with our requirements under applicable law.

**Security**. Plaid implements technical and organizational measures designed to safeguard your Plaid Account from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure and to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your data. However, we encourage you to take responsibility for securing your Plaid Account and other personal information, knowing that you provide it at your own risk. If you believe your Plaid Account has been compromised, please contact us immediately at [privacy@plaid.com](mailto:privacy@plaid.com).

**Miscellaneous**. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in these Plaid Account Terms will have the meanings ascribed to them in the [End User Services Agreement (US)](#end-user-services-agreement-us). In the event of a conflict between these Plaid Account Terms and the [End User Services Agreement (US)](#end-user-services-agreement-us), these Plaid Account Terms will control and prevail as applicable to your use of a Plaid Account; provided that all other provisions of the [End User Services Agreement (US)](#end-user-services-agreement-us) will remain in full force and effect. By accepting the Agreement or creating, accessing, managing, or using your Plaid Account, you agree to the Agreement and certify that you have all the necessary rights to do so. If you do not agree to the Agreement, please do not create, access, manage, or use a Plaid Account. If, at any time, you no longer agree to the Agreement, you may delete your Plaid Account. Plaid, in our sole discretion, may disable or delete a Plaid Account if (a) we suspect any violation of any of the terms contained in the Agreement, (b) your Plaid Account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time, (c) we suspect any unauthorized use of your Plaid Account, or (d) we are legally obligated to do so.

We reserve the right to withhold, refuse, or terminate access to the Services and/or End User Data in whole or in part where we believe the Services are being accessed or used in violation of this Policy or any other Plaid agreement, including Plaid’s agreements with any third party partners or data sources of Plaid (each, a “Partner”), or where use would pose a risk of harm, including reputational harm, to Plaid, its infrastructure, its data, the Services, an end user, or a Partner.

We will use reasonable efforts to notify you via email or other method when deciding to withhold, refuse, or terminate access to the Services and/or End User Data. We may immediately suspend or terminate access without notice if appropriate under the circumstances, such as when we become aware of activity that is a violation of any applicable law or when we determine, in our sole discretion, that harm is imminent.

Plaid will not be liable for any damages of any nature suffered by you or any third party resulting from Plaid’s exercise of its rights under this Policy or under applicable law.

##### Reporting Violations

If any person becomes aware of a violation of this Policy, we request that you immediately notify us via email to [legalnotices@plaid.com](mailto:legalnotices@plaid.com). We may take any appropriate action -- including reporting any activity or conduct that we suspect violates the law to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties -- in our sole discretion in respect to such violations.

##### Universal Data Access

Plaid promotes an Open Finance ecosystem in which end users own their data (e.g., financial data) and may grant access to such data to third parties. To the extent that you host any such end user data not already accessible by Plaid, upon Plaid’s reasonable request, the parties agree to cooperate in good faith to negotiate and initiate an arrangement for Plaid to access such end user data on behalf of end users.

##### Miscellaneous

The failure by you or Plaid to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein or in any other agreement you may have with us shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.

If any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Policy shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

##### Accès Universel aux Données

Plaid veut promouvoir un écosystème financier ouvert dans lequel les utilisateurs finaux détiennent leurs propres données (ex., des données financières) et peuvent accorder l'accès à celles-ci à des tiers. Dans la mesure où vous hébergez de telles données d’utilisateurs finaux non accessibles par Plaid, les parties conviennent à la demande de Plaid, de coopérer de bonne foi afin de négocier et de convenir d’un arrangement afin que Plaid puisse accéder aux données des utilisateurs finaux au nom des utilisateurs finaux.

##### Divers

Le fait pour Plaid ou vous-même de ne pas exercer un droit prévu dans la présente Politique ne constitue aucunement un abandon de ce droit ou du droit de l’utiliser ultérieurement.

Si une disposition de la présente Politique se révélerait être inapplicable ou invalide, cette disposition sera limitée ou annulée dans les limites du minimum nécessaire de sorte que la Politique demeure par ailleurs pleinement effective, en vigueur et applicable.

##### Suspensión y Cancelación

Nos reservamos el derecho de denegar, rechazar o cancelar el acceso a los Servicios y/o a los Datos del Usuario Final, en todo o en parte, si, a nuestro juicio, se está accediendo a los Servicios o se están utilizando de forma que se viole la presente Política o cualquier otro acuerdo de Plaid, incluyendo los acuerdos que Plaid mantiene con cualesquiera socios externos o fuentes de datos de Plaid (cada uno de ellos, un “Socio”), o cuando el uso pueda implicar un riesgo de daños, incluidos daños reputacionales, para Plaid, su infraestructura, sus datos, los Servicios, un usuario final o un Socio.

Haremos esfuerzos razonables para comunicarle por correo electrónico o por otro medio nuestra decisión de denegar, rechazar o cancelar el acceso a los Servicios y/o a los Datos del Usuario Final. Podremos suspender o cancelar el acceso de inmediato, sin comunicárselo con antelación, cuando sea apropiado según las circunstancias, como cuando tengamos conocimiento de una actividad que suponga una violación de cualquier normativa aplicable o cuando juzguemos, a nuestra entera discreción, que el daño es inminente.

Plaid no será responsable de ningún daño de ninguna naturaleza, que usted o cualquier tercero sufran como resultado del ejercicio, por parte de Plaid, de sus derechos conforme a esta Política o de acuerdo con la normativa aplicable.

##### Comunicación de Infracciones

Si cualquier persona tuviera conocimiento de una infracción de la presente Política, le rogamos que nos lo comunique de inmediato a través de un correo electrónico dirigido a legalnotices@plaid.com. Podremos adoptar cualquier medida pertinente (incluida la denuncia de cualquier actividad o conducta que sospechemos que viola la ley a las autoridades competentes, reguladores u otros terceros que correspondan), a nuestra entera discreción, con respecto a dichas violaciones.

##### Acceso Universal a los Datos

Plaid promueve un ecosistema Open Finance (Finanzas Abiertas) en el que los usuarios finales son propietarios de sus datos (p. ej. datos financieros) y pueden dar acceso a terceros a tales datos. En la medida en que usted aloje cualesquiera de esos datos de usuario final a los que Plaid todavía no tenga acceso, a petición razonable de Plaid, las partes acuerdan cooperar de buena fe para negociar e iniciar un acuerdo en virtud del cual Plaid tenga acceso a dichos datos de usuario final por cuenta de los usuarios finales.

##### Miscelánea

La falta de ejercicio por su parte o por parte de Plaid, en cualquier aspecto, de cualquier derecho establecido en este documento o en cualquier otro acuerdo que usted pueda tener con nosotros, no se considerará una renuncia a cualquier otro derecho aquí reconocido.

Si cualquier disposición de la presente Política fuera declarada inaplicable o carente de validez, dicha disposición se limitará o eliminará en la medida mínima necesaria, de forma tal que esta Política continúe estando plenamente vigente, con plenos efectos y siendo aplicable.

Sie dürfen Ihre Kontoinformationen, einschließlich Ihres Plaid Dashboard-Passworts, sowie Ihre API-Authentifizierungsdaten, einschließlich Ihrer Kundenidentifikationsnummer (die „Kunden-ID“) und Ihres Geheimnisses, niemals an Dritte weitergeben oder zulassen, dass eine andere Anwendung oder ein anderer Dienst in Ihrem Namen handelt.

##### Befolgung der anwendbaren Gesetze

Wenn Sie die Dienste nutzen, erklären Sie sich damit einverstanden, alle anwendbaren lokalen, bundesstaatlichen, nationalen und internationalen Gesetze zu befolgen. Darüber hinaus bestätigen Sie, dass Sie, Ihr Unternehmen, Ihre Mitarbeiter, Ihre Dienstleister und alle anderen, die in Ihrem Namen handeln, alle anwendbaren Gesetze befolgen, insbesondere solche, die sich auf Finanzdaten, Datenschutz, Privatsphäre und Datensicherheit beziehen.

Des Weiteren bestätigen Sie, dass Sie, Ihre Führungskräfte, Direktoren, Aktionäre, direkten und indirekten Muttergesellschaften, Tochtergesellschaften und verbundenen Unternehmen:

B. die Export Administration Regulations, die International Traffic in Arms Regulations und die vom Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) umgesetzten Wirtschaftssanktionsprogramme) befolgen und befolgen werden
* keinen Sanktionen unterliegen oder im Eigentum von Parteien stehen, die Sanktionen unterliegen oder anderweitig auf einer sanktionsbezogenen Liste aufgeführt sind, beispielsweise auf der von der US-Regierung geführten Liste der „Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons“ (OFAC), der vom Bureau of Industry and Security des US-Handelsministeriums geführten „Entity List“ und der vom US-Außenministerium geführten „CAATSA Section 231(d)“-Liste, einer Liste des Sicherheitsrats der Vereinten Nationen, des Vereinigten Königreichs, der Europäischen Union oder ihrer Mitgliedstaaten oder einer anderen zuständigen Regierungsbehörde, und
* sich weder jetzt noch in Zukunft an Aktivitäten beteiligen, die es erforderlich machen oder ermöglichen, dass eine zuständige Regierungsbehörde eine Vollstreckungsmaßnahme gegen Sie oder uns ergreift oder wirtschaftliche Sanktionen gegen uns verhängt.

Die unmittelbar vorstehend genannten Bestätigungen werden nicht verlangt und nicht abgegeben, wenn und soweit das Verlangen oder die Bestätigung einen Verstoß gegen das EU-Sperrgesetz, gegen Gesetze oder Verordnungen zur Umsetzung des EU-Sperrgesetzes in den EU-Mitgliedstaaten oder im Vereinigten Königreich oder gegen ähnliche Anti-Boykott-, Nicht-Diskriminierungs- oder Sperrbestimmungen, die im Rahmen der anwendbaren lokalen Gesetze vorgesehen sind, darstellen würde.

Sie sind allein dafür verantwortlich, dass Ihre Nutzung der Dienste im Einklang mit allen auf Sie anwendbaren Gesetzen steht, insbesondere mit den Regeln und Richtlinien aller Systeme oder Netzwerke, die Zahlungen ermöglichen, sowie mit allen Sicherheitsanforderungen, einschließlich der Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), soweit diese auf Sie anwendbar sind.

##### Sicherheit

Für die sichere Aufbewahrung Ihres Plaid Dashboard-Benutzernamens und -Passworts sowie Ihrer API-Authentifizierungsdaten, einschließlich Ihrer Kunden-ID und Ihres Geheimnisses, sind Sie selbst verantwortlich. Für den Fall einer Verletzung der Sicherheit oder einer unbefugten Nutzung Ihres Kontos oder von Endnutzerdaten verpflichten Sie sich, uns unverzüglich unter security@plaid.com zu benachrichtigen. Sie dürfen Ihre Kunden-ID und Ihr Geheimnis niemals veröffentlichen, teilen oder weitergeben und müssen diese Informationen bei der Speicherung und während der Übertragung verschlüsseln.

Ihre Systeme und Anwendungen müssen die Endnutzerdaten sicher behandeln. In Bezug auf Endnutzerdaten sollten Sie bewährte Praktiken der Branche befolgen, müssen aber mindestens die folgenden Maßnahmen ergreifen:

* Treffen Sie administrative, technische und physische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen, um die Sicherheit, den Datenschutz und die Vertraulichkeit von Endnutzerdaten zu gewährleisten.
* Setzen Sie bei der Speicherung oder Übertragung von Endnutzerdaten moderne und branchenübliche Verschlüsselungsverfahren ein.
* Führen Sie angemessene Zugangskontrollen durch, um den Zugriff auf Endnutzerdaten auf autorisierte Personen zu beschränken, die dafür eine geschäftliche Notwendigkeit haben.
* Überwachen Sie Ihre Systeme auf unbefugten Zugriff.
* Schließen Sie rechtzeitig etwaige Sicherheitslücken.
* Protokollieren und überprüfen Sie alle Ereignisse, die auf einen unbefugten Zugriff hinweisen.
* Planen Sie Sicherheitszwischenfälle und Ihre Reaktion darauf.
* Halten Sie die einschlägigen Regeln und Vorschriften in Bezug auf die Art der von Ihnen gehandhabten Daten ein, wie z. B. die Safeguards Rule des Graham-Leach-Bliley Act.

##### Datenspeicherung und -verwendung

Alle Endnutzerdaten, die sich in Ihrem Besitz befinden, müssen sicher und unter Beachtung der anwendbaren Gesetze aufbewahrt werden. Sollten Sie Endnutzerdaten in anonymisierter Form verwenden, müssen Sie den Endnutzer klar und deutlich darauf hinweisen, einschließlich einer Beschreibung, wie Sie diese anonymisierten Endnutzerdaten verwenden.

##### Deaktivierung des Kontos

Wenn Sie die Dienste nicht mehr gemäß der geltenden Vereinbarung mit uns nutzen, können Sie Ihr Konto anhand der Anweisungen auf der Website deaktivieren. Wir können Ihr Konto auch deaktivieren, wenn Sie die Dienste drei Monate lang nicht mehr genutzt haben, wenn Ihre Vereinbarung mit uns gekündigt wird oder ausläuft oder wenn dies nach dem anwendbaren Recht angemessen ist. Nach der Deaktivierung Ihres Kontos werden wir Ihnen den Zugriff auf alle mit Ihrer Integration verbundenen Endnutzerdaten entziehen.

Selbst nach der Deaktivierung Ihres Kontos können wir, soweit dies gesetzlich zulässig ist, die von uns über Sie erfassten Daten so lange aufbewahren, wie es für die Erfüllung der in unserer Datenschutzrichtlinie/-erklärung genannten Zwecke erforderlich ist, oder noch länger, wenn dies nach dem anwendbaren Recht erforderlich oder zulässig ist.

##### Verbotenes Verhalten

Sie verpflichten sich, Folgendes zu unterlassen und auch Dritte nicht dabei zu unterstützen:

* Endnutzerdaten an Vermarkter oder andere Dritte zu verkaufen oder zu vermieten
* auf die Dienste oder Endnutzerdaten für ungesetzliche, verletzende, bedrohende, missbräuchliche, obszöne, belästigende, verleumderische, täuschende oder betrügerische Zwecke zuzugreifen oder diese zu nutzen

* „personenbezogene Daten“ (wie in der Verordnung (EU) 2016/679 \[Datenschutz-Grundverordnung\] definiert) zu verwenden, offenzulegen oder anderweitig zu verarbeiten, es sei denn, dies geschieht unter strikter Einhaltung des anwendbaren Rechts
* auf die Dienste zuzugreifen oder diese zu nutzen oder auf Endnutzerdaten zuzugreifen, diese zu übermitteln, zu verarbeiten oder zu speichern, wenn dies gegen einschlägige Datenschutzgesetze verstoßen oder eine Verletzung des Vertrags oder der Vereinbarung mit dem jeweiligen Endnutzer darstellen würde
* auf die Dienste zuzugreifen oder diese zu nutzen, um ein Patent, eine Marke, ein Geschäftsgeheimnis, ein Urheberrecht, ein Veröffentlichungsrecht oder ein anderes Recht einer natürlichen oder juristischen Person zu verletzen
* zu einem anderen als dem von uns vorgesehenen Zweck auf die Dienste zuzugreifen oder diese zu nutzen, einschließlich zu Zwecken der Wettbewerbsanalyse, des Ausspionierens, der Schaffung eines Ersatzprodukts oder eines ähnlichen Angebots zu den Diensten oder zu anderen unlauteren Zwecken
* die Schwachstellen der Infrastruktur von Plaid ohne ausdrückliche vorherige schriftliche Genehmigung von Plaid zu scannen oder zu testen (manuell oder auf automatisierte Weise)

* auf eine Weise auf die Dienste oder Endnutzerdaten zuzugreifen oder diese zu nutzen, die gegen eine Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen oder dem Endnutzer und Plaid verstößt, oder
* auf die Dienste oder Endnutzerdaten in einer Weise zuzugreifen oder diese zu nutzen, die gegen ein anwendbares Gesetz, ein Regelwerk, eine Verordnung oder eine Vorschrift verstößt

##### Aussetzung und Beendigung

Wir behalten uns das Recht vor, den Zugang zu den Diensten und/oder Endnutzerdaten ganz oder teilweise zu verweigern oder zu beenden, wenn wir glauben, dass der Zugang zu den Diensten oder deren Nutzung gegen diese Richtlinie oder eine andere Vereinbarung von Plaid verstößt, einschließlich der Vereinbarungen von Plaid mit Drittpartnern oder Datenquellen von Plaid (jeweils ein „Partner“), oder wenn die Nutzung das Risiko eines Schadens, einschließlich eines Imageschadens, für Plaid, seine Infrastruktur, seine Daten, die Dienste, einen Endnutzer oder einen Partner bedeuten würde.

Falls wir beschließen, den Zugang zu den Diensten und/oder Endnutzerdaten zu sperren, zu verweigern oder zu beenden, werden wir uns in angemessener Weise bemühen, Sie per E-Mail oder auf anderem Wege zu informieren. Wir können den Zugang sofort und ohne Vorankündigung aussetzen oder beenden, wenn die Umstände dies erfordern, z. B. wenn wir von Aktivitäten Kenntnis erlangen, die gegen ein anwendbares Gesetz verstoßen, oder wenn wir nach eigenem Ermessen feststellen, dass ein Schaden droht.

Plaid haftet nicht für Schäden irgendwelcher Art, die Ihnen oder Dritten durch die Wahrnehmung der Rechte von Plaid aus dieser Richtlinie oder nach anwendbarem Recht entstehen.

##### Meldung von Verstößen

Sollten Sie von einem Verstoß gegen diese Richtlinie Kenntnis erlangen, bitten wir Sie, uns unverzüglich per E-Mail an legalnotices@plaid.com zu informieren. Wir können nach eigenem Ermessen in Bezug auf solche Verstöße alle angemessenen Maßnahmen ergreifen – einschließlich der Meldung von Aktivitäten oder Verhaltensweisen, die unserer Meinung nach gegen das Gesetz verstoßen, an die zuständigen Strafverfolgungsbehörden, Aufsichtsbehörden oder andere geeignete Dritte.

##### Universeller Datenzugriff

Plaid unterstützt ein Open Finance-Ökosystem, in dem Endnutzer Eigentümer ihrer Daten (z. B. Finanzdaten) sind und Dritten Zugang zu diesen Daten verschaffen können. Soweit Sie solche Endnutzerdaten hosten, die Plaid noch nicht zugänglich sind, verpflichten sich die Parteien, nach angemessener Aufforderung durch Plaid nach Treu und Glauben miteinander zu kooperieren, um eine Vereinbarung auszuhandeln und in die Wege zu leiten, die Plaid den Zugriff auf diese Endnutzerdaten im Namen der Endnutzer erlaubt.

##### Sonstiges

Das Versäumnis Ihrerseits oder von Plaid, ein hierin oder in einer anderen Vereinbarung mit uns vorgesehenes Recht geltend zu machen, gilt nicht als Verzicht auf weitere Rechte aus der Vereinbarung.

Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Richtlinie für nicht durchsetzbar oder unwirksam befunden werden, wird diese Bestimmung auf das erforderliche Mindestmaß beschränkt oder aufgehoben, so dass diese Richtlinie ansonsten in vollem Umfang wirksam und durchsetzbar bleibt.

You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service is in compliance with all laws applicable to you, including without limitation, the rules and guidelines of any system or network that facilitates payments and any security requirements, including under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), as may be applicable to you.

##### Suspension and Termination

We reserve the right to withhold, refuse, or terminate access to the Service and/or End User Data in whole or in part where we believe the Service is being accessed or used in violation of this Policy or any other Plaid agreement, including Plaid’s agreements with any third party partners or data sources of Plaid (each, a “Partner”), or where use would pose a risk of harm, including reputational harm, to Plaid, its infrastructure, its data, the Service, an end user, or a Partner.

We will use reasonable efforts to notify you via email or other method when deciding to withhold, refuse, or terminate access to the Service and/or End User Data. We may immediately suspend or terminate access without notice if appropriate under the circumstances, such as when we become aware of activity that is a violation of any applicable law or when we determine, in our sole discretion, that harm is imminent.

Plaid will not be liable for any damages of any nature suffered by you or any third party resulting from Plaid’s exercise of its rights under this Policy or under applicable law.

##### Reporting Violations

If any person becomes aware of a violation of this Policy, we request that you immediately notify us via email to [legalnotices@plaid.com](mailto:legalnotices@plaid.com). We may take any appropriate action -- including reporting any activity or conduct that we suspect violates the law to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties -- in our sole discretion in respect to such violations.

##### Miscellaneous

The failure by you or Plaid to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.

If any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Policy shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

Your Cards may also have certain Card Transaction types disabled, such as cash withdrawals at an ATM.
    2. The limits and restrictions that apply to your Account and Card will be communicated to you during the Account set-up process and/or before the Card is issued to you (as applicable). These limits may also change over time based on your Account and/or Card usage; any such change will be communicated to you. You can check the limits at any time by contacting Customer Services. You should not make a payment Transaction request which exceeds such.

From time to time a Card Transaction may be authorised which exceeds the limit or restriction applicable to your Account or Card, for example when it is used in an offline environment for example but not limited to payments for or on transport (purchases on a train, aeroplane, underground or toll payments). In such circumstance, a negative balance on your Account may occur. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.15 to 5.17 inclusive will apply.

The pre-authorisation allows the Merchant up to 30 days to claim and settle any funds owed to them from the Card. Examples include but are not limited to hotels and rental cars. If there are insufficient funds available on your Account, Modulr must still make this settlement, which may result in a negative balance on your Account. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.15 to 5.17 inclusive will apply.

    5. If we are unable to credit your Account for any of the reasons in paragraph 5.3 then the funds may be sent back to the sender without a prior notification to you.
    6. Your Account will be configured and operated by the Partner Platform. You agree that Modulr and we may take instructions from the Partner Platform regarding the operation of your Account, including the creation of beneficiaries and instruction of payments, on your behalf. We and Modulr have no liability for actions taken by the Partner Platform. If you disagree with any actions taken by the Partner Platform these should be discussed with the Partner Platform. We are also authorised to take instructions from any other Account Manager (where different from Partner Platform) and, with respect to Physical Card Transactions, from the Cardholder. You are responsible for all actions of the Account Manager and any Cardholder in relation to the Account and/or Card(s).
    7. Your Account can make payments out to external bank accounts via SEPA Transfer, Faster Payments, SWIFT Payments (if selected as a Modulr Product) and other methods as added and notified to you by the Partner Platform from time to time. With regard to SEPA Transfers, Modulr will automatically process inbound and outbound SEPA payments via SEPA Instant Credit Transfers where possible. In the event Modulr is unable to process such payments via SEPA Instant Credit Transfers, the payments will default to being made via SEPA Credit Transfers.

    9. Where a Virtual Card or Physical Card is issued to you, you may be able to register and/or store the details of the Card within third-party apps and/or devices and to use those third-party apps/devices to initiate payments with your Card. When you first register your Card within a third-party app/device we support, you may be required to verify that it is you requesting the registration of the Card. If you do not do this, you may not be able to register and use your Card through the third-party app/device.
    10. The value of any Card Transaction, together with any applicable fees and charges, will be deducted from your Account once we receive the authorization request from the Merchant.
    11. If the Card Transaction is made in a currency other than the currency the Card is denominated in, the Card Transaction will be converted to the currency of the Card by the relevant Card Scheme at a rate set by it on the day we receive details of the Card Transaction. The exchange rate varies throughout the day and is not set by us. You can check the relevant Card Scheme rate as follows:
    
    * Mastercard Card Scheme rate at: [https://www.mastercard.co.uk/en-gb/consumers/get-support/convert-currency.html](https://www.mastercard.co.uk/en-gb/consumers/get-support/convert-currency.html);
    * VISA Card Scheme rate at: [https://www.visa.co.uk/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html](https://www.visa.co.uk/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html).
    
    13. If you use the Card to make a purchase online, you may be asked by the Merchant to use 3DS. Physical Cards are automatically enrolled for use with 3DS. When you use 3DS, you agree that the following shall apply in relation to your use of the Card:
    
    * You must provide us with your mobile phone number before you can use 3DS. You must ensure that your mobile phone can receive SMS at the time of your purchase.
    * When you use 3DS to purchase from a participating Merchant, you will be presented with an electronic receipt and the One-Time Passcode will be sent to your mobile phone.
    * Without your One-Time Passcode, you will not be able to make purchases from participating Merchants.
    * If you update your mobile phone number, then you must notify us immediately of your new details to ensure our records are correct.
    * The One-Time Passcode is valid for the purchase you received it for. You are responsible for the security and confidentiality of your One-Time Passcode and must not share it with anyone else.
    * You will be responsible for any fees or charges imposed by your mobile phone service provider in connection with your use of 3DS.
    
    15. A Transaction is deemed to be authorized by you when you or your Account Manager or Partner Platform:
        
        * enters the security information on the Modulr Online Portal to confirm a Transaction is authorized or when it is instructed via the Modulr API with the relevant security credentials;
        * when you or your Account Manager or Partner Platform submits a request for the creation of a Virtual Card via the Online Portal or Modulr API, you shall be deemed to have authorized any subsequent Virtual Card Transaction made using such Virtual Card up to the authorization value specified when creating the request for the creation of the Virtual Card;
        * when you or the Cardholder (i) enter a PIN or provide any other security credentials; (ii) sign a sales voucher; (iii) provide the Physical Card details and/or provide any other details as requested; (iv) wave/swipe the Physical Card over a card reader; or (v) insert the Physical Card into a card device or an ATM;
        * when you give instructions through a third party (such as the recipient of a Payment Initiation Service Provider).
        
        Once the Transaction is confirmed, we cannot revoke the Transaction save for in those circumstances set out in paragraph 5.13 below.
        
    16. You can cancel any Transaction which is agreed to take place on a date later than the date you authorized it, provided that you give us notice to cancel no later than the close of business on the Business Day before the Transaction was due to take place.
    17. Cancelling a recurring Card Transaction with us will not cancel the agreement with the organization you are paying. It is your responsibility to tell the organization collecting the payment about the changes to your instructions.
    18. If for any reason whatsoever, a negative balance arises because a Transaction is completed when there are not enough funds on your Account for that Transaction, you shall reimburse the negative balance amount immediately, unless circumstances described in sections 5.16 and 5.17 apply. You agree that once we make this negative balance known to you, we will charge you the amount of the negative balance, and you must repay it immediately. We may set-off the amount of the negative balance against any funds on your Account, including any subsequently loaded funds. Until we are reimbursed this negative balance amount, we may arrange for your Account, including Card(s), to be suspended. We may also report the negative balance to credit reference agencies.
    19. Where a negative balance arises because of an error on the part of a Merchant where the Card Transaction occurred, we will seek to recover the negative balance amount from the Merchant.
    20. Where a negative balance arises because of an error on the part of the recipient of the payment or us, we will seek to recover the negative balance amount from the person who made the error.
    21. The Available Balance on your Account will not earn any interest.

Your Cards may also have certain Card Transaction types disabled, such as cash withdrawals at an ATM.
    2. The limits and restrictions that apply to your Account and Card will be communicated to you during the Account set-up process and/or before the Card is issued to you (as applicable). These limits may also change over time based on your Account and/or Card usage; any such change will be communicated to you. You can check the limits at any time by contacting Customer Services. You should not make a payment Transaction request which exceeds such.
    3. From time to time a Card Transaction may be authorised which exceeds the limit or restriction applicable to your Account or Card, for example when it is used in an offline environment for example but not limited to payments for or on transport (purchases on a train, aeroplane, underground or toll payments). In such circumstance, a negative balance on your Account may occur. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.14 to 5.16 inclusive will apply.

This amount will be unavailable to you until the Card Transaction is completed or released by the Merchant. The pre-authorisation allows the Merchant up to 30 days to claim and settle any funds owed to them from the Card. Examples include but are not limited to hotels and rental cars. If there are insufficient funds available on your Account, Modulr must still make this settlement, which may result in a negative balance on your Account. In this case the process in paragraphs 5.14 to 5.16 inclusive will apply.
    5. To manage our risk, particularly with respect to money laundering, fraud or security concerns, we also apply internal controls, including limits, to certain types of payment. We change these as necessary but for security purposes, we do not disclose them.

    19. The Available Balance on your Account will not earn any interest.

We will not tell you if doing so would compromise our security measures or would otherwise be unlawful.

If you have provided consent to a TPP to access the data in your Account to enable them to provide account information services to you or initiate Transactions on your behalf, you consent to us sharing your information with the TPP as is reasonably required for them to provide their services to you.

Within this period, you may at any time request a refund by contacting Customer Services.

After you notify us, we will replace a lost, stolen or misappropriated Physical Card and/or security credentials, as appropriate.
    2.

    1. subject to 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 we will immediately refund the amount to your Account to the position it would have been in if the unauthorised Transaction had not taken place. We will have no further liability to you. If we subsequently discover that you were not entitled to a refund, we shall treat the refund as a mistake and be entitled to reapply the Transaction.
    2. if there are reasonable grounds for thinking that you may not be entitled to a refund (based on the evidence available to us at the time you report the unauthorised Transaction), we may investigate before giving you a refund and we will provide you with our supporting evidence if we believe you are not entitled to the refund;
    3. if the Transaction was initiated through a TPP, it is for the TPP to prove that, the Transaction was authenticated, accurately recorded and not affected by a technical breakdown or other deficiency linked to the TPP's payment initiation service; and

    6. You will be liable for all Transactions made from your Account if you (or the Account Manager or the Cardholder) have acted fraudulently or have failed with gross negligence:
    
    1. to keep the security credentials used to access or use your Account and/or Card safe and secure or otherwise failed to comply with these Terms and Conditions in relation to the safety of your Account and/or Card; or
    2. failed to notify us in accordance with 9.1 above.

    3. you asked for a refund within 8 weeks of the date the Transaction was debited to your Account.
    
    In such circumstances we will refund you within 10 Business Days of receiving your claim for a refund or, where applicable, within 10 Business Days of receiving any further information we requested - or we will provide you with reasons for refusing the refund.10.

#### UK Safeguarding

**A message from Modulr: How we keep customer funds safe**

At Modulr, we work hard to ensure that all our customer communications are clear and we're committed to playing our part in increasing standards across the industry. So, we welcome the chance to offer further clarity around the differences in protections between our services and traditional banking, and answer some frequently asked questions.

**Who is Modulr?**

Modulr is the embedded payments platform for digital businesses that need a faster, easier and more reliable way to move money. We provide the digital infrastructure that enables our customers and partners to embed payment and account functionality directly into their platforms, workflows and customer experiences.

**Is Modulr a bank?**

Modulr is not a bank, we're an E-money Institution (EMI).  
An EMI is an organisation that has been authorised by the regulator to issue e-money accounts and provide related payment services. In the UK, we're authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and in the EU we're regulated by De Nederlandsche Bank.  
Our payment accounts come with sort codes or Euro IBANs, access to payment schemes and everything you would expect, but all in a faster, easier and more reliable way.

**How is Modulr different from a bank?**

One of the main differences between Modulr, an EMI, and a bank is that banks lend money, whereas EMIs are prohibited from lending money. Specifically, banks receive deposits from customersthat they use to lend money out and make a profit on the difference . By contrast, an EMI such as Modulr holds 100% of client funds at all times, does not lend any customer funds or offer interest on balances.  
Our payment services however are regulated by the same payments regulations that apply to banks.

**How does Modulr protect customer funds?**

Modulr is required by law to use a process called Safeguarding to protect customer money. This means we ensure that 100% of the funds we receive in exchange for e-money are safeguarded on receipt, meaning that these are segregated from all other funds that we hold and they cannot be used for any other purposes. This is completely separate from the additional funds that Modulr holds to meet its corporate obligations and run its business. 100% of the funds we safeguard must be held in specially designated client accounts at credit institutions (banks) or the Bank of England (see 'Where is my money safeguarded?' below).  
Furthermore, as an EMI, we must also hold an additional 2% of the total value of safeguarded client funds in our own funds, which are held separately to those client funds. The purpose of the additional 2% funds is to ensure that, in the case of any problems with our business, there are enough funds to support an orderly business wind-down and the process of returning of client funds . Combining this '2%' requirement with the safeguarding means that customer funds are 100% available to a customer, and there is a protection mechanism to help ensure an orderly wind down if ever required.  
So, while the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is not applicable to e-money, the regulatory requirements outlined above can be relied upon instead and protects the balance of customer funds, as opposed to only compensating up to a limit as is the case with the FSCS

**What is the FSCS and is it applicable to Modulr?**

The FSCS offers consumers protection of their bank deposits up to £85,000 maximum, or £170,000 for a joint account, in the event of a bank failure. The FSCS scheme only applies to banks, and therefore is not relevant to an EMI such as Modulr. However, as mentioned, Safeguarding means that 100% of customer money at Modulr, regardless of the amount, is segregated from all other funds that we hold and cannot be used for any other purpose.

**What would happen in the unlikely event of Modulr's insolvency?**

In addition to the safeguarding and further '2%' requirements we're also required to prepare orderly wind down planning. These plans include the early identification of a potential insolvency event and the return of your funds before an insolvency process if possible. We have to provide these plans to the FCA and they are subject to external audit review. This further reduces the unlikely event of your funds having to be returned during our insolvency. In the unlikely event that Modulr becomes insolvent, your funds are separate from the funds of Modulr and therefore the creditors of Modulr (other third parties that are owed money from Modulr) are not able to make a claim or have effect on your funds.  
An independent insolvency professional (referred to as an 'insolvency practitioner') will be appointed to return your funds to you. However, where an insolvency practitioner is unable to take their costs of sending the funds to you from elsewhere (for example, the general pot of Modulr funds remaining or from the additional 2% own funds described above) they are entitled to take their costs from your funds. In this unlikely circumstance, while you'll likely receive most of your funds you may not receive the total value if costs are deducted. The process of returning your funds by an insolvency practitioner is likely to take longer than if you were making a claim in the FSCS.

**Where is money safeguarded?**

Modulr must deposit 100% of the value if all the e-money it has issued to customers at a credit institution (banks) or the Bank of England. Modulr uses a range of clearing banks for different services but, with our direct access to Faster Payments and Bacs, Modulr is one of a few non-bank Payment Service Providers to hold funds associated with GBP domestic flows directly at the Bank of England. Our safeguarding processes are subject to independent yearly external audit, providing further confidence that we adhere to the regulations required for safeguarding.

**Who regulates Modulr in the UK?**

Modulr FS Ltd (FRN: 900573) is licensed as an authorised E-Money Institution (EMI) and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This enables Modulr to issue e-money to its customers, hold customer funds in safeguarded accounts and provide related payment services to customers. Modulr Finance Limited (FRN: 900699) is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority as an EMD Agent of Modulr FS Limited.  
Payment services in the UK are subject to the Payment Services Regulations (PSRs). The PSRs apply to all payment services, meaning in relation to payment services, there is no difference in how Modulr and other payment service providers and banks are regulated.

**Who regulates Modulr in the EU?**

Modulr Finance B.V. is licensed and regulated by De Nederlandsche Bank (Relatienummer R182870) as an Electronic Money Institution.

If you do not want your information retained in the event you are not offered a position, as applicable, please refer to the following sections below for options that may be available to you: [California Candidates Data Protection Rights](#california-candidates-data-protection-rights) and [UK, EEA, and Canadian Candidates Data Protection Rights](#uk-eea-and-canadian-candidates-data-protection-rights).

Plaid does not use your personal data for automated individual decision making (including profiling).

##### How We Disclose Your Information

We disclose your personal data to others as follows, or as otherwise described in this Notice:

* between and among Plaid and our subsidiaries and affiliated entities, as the specific entity you're applying to work for is part of a wider group of companies with headquarters in the United States and offices in various jurisdictions that share human resources and IT systems for processing your application, assessing your suitability for the role, and initiating employment (if applicable);
    
* with our data processors and other service providers, including data analytics service providers, background check service providers, and recruitment agencies, in connection with the services they perform for us or on our behalf. Where required, these service providers, partners, or vendors acting on our behalf will be subject to contractual obligations to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the Candidate Information, and to process it only as instructed.
    
* to law enforcement, government authorities, regulators, and other third parties, such as courts and other authorities, independent external advisers and internal compliance and investigation teams, if we believe such disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any applicable law, regulation, or legal process;
    
* in connection with, or during the negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company, as permitted by applicable law;
    
* as necessary to protect Plaid, including to establish, exercise, or defend against potential, threatened or actual legal claims;
    
* to enforce any contract with you or if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our policies;
    
* to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; or
    
* for any other notified purpose, with your consent or at your direction.
    

We may also use or disclose aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

##### Our Lawful Bases for Processing (UK and EEA Candidates Only)

For candidates in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting, using, and sharing Candidate Information will depend on the information concerned and the context in which we collected or processed it. In general, however, we will normally only collect and process Candidate Information where:

(a) we need to comply with legal obligations applicable to us (such as applicable immigration and/or employment laws and regulations);

(b) we need the information to fulfill our responsibilities in any actual or prospective agreement with you (such as an employment agreement or an offer of employment if you are considered for employment);

(c) the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (such as to ensure a safe working environment for all our team members, and to ensure the reliability of our candidates, and otherwise to administer and process your application, or to communicate with you about your application); and

(d) we have your consent to do so (in cases where your consent is truly freely given).

Where we are legally allowed or required to collect and process special categories of data (for example, race), then we will only process such information:

* where we reasonably need to do so in order to comply with our legal obligations as a prospective employer;
    
* where we need to do so in order to be informed of your working capacity;
    
* where we need to do so to protect your or another person's vital interests (and we are unable to obtain your consent); or
    
* where you have given us your consent (in cases where your consent is truly freely given).
    

To the extent we rely on consent to collect and process Candidate Information, you have the right to decline your consent or to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at [people-privacy@plaid.com](mailto:people-privacy@plaid.com). Withdrawing your consent will not, however, affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal data conducted for other purposes in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

##### Our Retention Practices

We retain Candidate Information for no longer than necessary to satisfy the purpose for which it was collected and used, as described in this Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted under applicable law. As noted above, however, if you accept employment with Plaid, your Candidate Information will become part of your employment record and will be used for employment purposes in accordance with applicable law and any applicable Employee Privacy Notice.

#### Other Details

##### International Data Transfers

We operate internationally, and as a result, will transfer Candidate Information across international borders, including from the UK, EEA, and/or Canada to the United States, for processing and storage. To the extent that Candidate Information is transferred from the UK or EEA to territories/countries for which the EU Commission and/or Secretary of State in the UK (as appropriate) has not made a finding that the legal framework in that territory/country provides adequate protection for individuals' rights and freedoms for their personal data, we will transfer such data consistent with applicable data protection laws, including through the use of the EU Commission-approved and/or Secretary of State in the UK approved (as appropriate) standard contractual clauses (as applicable). You can ask for a copy of these standard contractual clauses by contacting us as set out below.

In addition, we are committed to ensure that we comply with any additional requirements or guidelines from the European Court of Justice, data protection law and/or supervisory authorities in relation to the transfer of personal data.

##### California Candidates Data Protection Rights

The California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA”, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, affords candidates residing in California certain rights with respect to their Candidate Information. If you are a California resident, this section applies to you.

We collect, or have collected in the preceding 12 months, the categories of Candidate Information listed in the below table from the sources identified in the “Information We Collect” section. For details about the precise data points we collect, or have collected in the preceding 12 months, please see the “Information We Collect” section above. We use and disclose the Candidate Information for the business and commercial purposes listed in the following table, and we disclose the Candidate Information to the recipients also listed in the following table.

![Candidate Information table](/_next/image?url=/assets/img/legal/candidate-privacy-notice/candidate-information-table-en@2x.png&w=1920&q=75)

We retain the categories of Candidate Information in accordance with the retention practices described above in [Our Retention Practices](#candidate-privacy-our-retention-practices).

Plaid does not (1) “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined by the CCPA) Candidate Information or (2) use or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose other than what is specified in CCPA section 1798.121(a).

Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to (a) request to know more about the sources of and the categories and specific pieces of Candidate Information we collect, use, and disclose and the categories of third parties to which we disclose such information, (b) request deletion of Candidate Information, (c) request correction of inaccurate Candidate Information, and (d) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. You may make these requests by emailing us at people-privacy@plaid.com completing this [webform](https://plaid.com/legal/data-protection-request-form/) or calling (415) 799 - 1354. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your recent interactions with us, such as your phone number and email address. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

If we receive your request from an authorized agent who does not provide a valid power of attorney, we may ask the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request to exercise rights on your behalf. In the absence of a valid power of attorney, we may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or confirm to us that you otherwise provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please email us at [people-privacy@plaid.com](mailto:people-privacy@plaid.com).

##### UK, EEA, and Canadian Candidates Data Protection Rights

Under applicable law, you have certain rights in relation to your Candidate Information. These rights can differ by country and province.

Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, those rights include the right to: (i) know whether we process personal data about you, (ii) request access to or rectification of the personal data we process about you; (iii) object to, or request that we restrict, the processing of your personal data; (iv) request that we delete personal data about you; (v) request that we provide the personal data you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, for transmission to another controller; (vi) revoke consent at any time where our processing is based on your consent; and (vii) lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (if you are in the UK, please see this [page](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/) for contact details for the UK Information Commissioner's Office and if you’re in the EEA, please see this [page](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en) for contact details).

##### Nos bases légales pour le traitement (candidats au Royaume-Uni et dans l’EEE uniquement)

Pour les candidats au Royaume-Uni (« Royaume-Uni ») et dans l’Espace économique européen (« EEE »), notre base juridique pour la collecte, l’utilisation et le partage des Informations relatives au Candidat dépendra des informations concernées et du contexte dans lequel nous les avons collectées ou traitées. Toutefois, nous recueillerons et traiterons, en général, les Informations relatives au Candidat uniquement dans les cas suivants:

(a) nous devons nous conformer aux obligations légales qui nous sont applicables (comme les lois et réglementations applicables en matière d’immigration ou d’emploi);

(b) nous avons besoin des informations pour remplir nos responsabilités dans tout accord réel ou potentiel avec vous (tel qu’un contrat de travail ou une offre d’emploi si votre candidature est envisagée);

(c) le traitement est nécessaire pour nos intérêts légitimes et n’est pas outrepassé par vos intérêts en matière de protection des données ou vos droits et libertés fondamentaux (par exemple, pour assurer un environnement de travail sûr pour tous les membres de notre équipe), et pour assurer la fiabilité de nos candidats, et autrement administrer et traiter votre candidature ou pour communiquer avec vous au sujet de votre candidature; et

(d) nous disposons de votre consentement pour le faire (dans les cas où le consentement est réellement donné librement).

Lorsque nous sommes légalement autorisés ou tenus de collecter et de traiter des catégories particulières de données (par exemple, la race), nous traiterons alors uniquement ces informations:

* lorsque nous devons raisonnablement le faire afin de nous conformer à nos obligations légales en tant qu’employeur potentiel;
    
* lorsque nous devons le faire afin d’être informés de votre capacité de travail;
    
* lorsque nous devons le faire pour protéger vos intérêts vitaux ou ceux d’une autre personne (et que nous ne sommes pas en mesure d’obtenir votre consentement); ou
    
* lorsque vous nous avez donné votre consentement (dans les cas où votre consentement est réellement donné librement).
    

Dans la mesure où nous nous fondons sur le consentement pour collecter et traiter des Informations relatives au Candidat, vous êtes en droit de refuser de donner votre consentement ou de retirer votre consentement à tout moment en nous envoyant un courriel à l’adresse [people-privacy@plaid.com](mailto:people-privacy@plaid.com). Le retrait de votre consentement n’affectera toutefois pas la légalité de tout traitement que nous avons effectué avant votre retrait, ni le traitement de vos données à caractère personnel à d’autres fins menées sur la base de motifs de traitement légaux autres que le consentement.

##### Nos pratiques de conservation

Nous conservons les Informations relatives au Candidat uniquement le temps nécessaire à la réalisation de la finalité pour laquelle elles ont été collectées et utilisées, conformément au présent Avis, à moins qu’une période de conservation plus longue ne soit requise ou autorisée par la loi applicable. Comme indiqué ci-dessus, cependant, si vous acceptez un emploi chez Plaid, vos Informations relatives au Candidat feront partie de votre dossier d’emploi et seront utilisées à des fins d’emploi conformément à la loi applicable et à tout Avis de confidentialité du personnel applicable.

#### Autres informations

##### Transferts internationaux de données

Nous exerçons nos activités à l’international et, par conséquent, nous transférerons les Informations relatives au Candidat au-delà des frontières internationales, notamment depuis le Royaume-Uni, l’EEE et/ou le Canada vers les États-Unis à des fins de traitement et de stockage. Dans la mesure où les Informations relatives au Candidat sont transférées du Royaume-Uni ou de l’EEE vers des territoires/pays dans lesquels la Commission européenne et/ou le Secrétaire d’état du Royaume-Uni (le cas échéant) a estimé que le cadre juridique de ce territoire/pays n’offrait pas une protection adéquate pour les droits et les libertés des personnes en matière de données personnelles, nous transférerons ces données en conformité avec les lois applicables en matière de protection des données, notamment en utilisant les clauses contractuelles types approuvées (le cas échéant) par la Commission européenne et/ou le Secrétaire d’état du Royaume-Uni (le cas échéant). Vous pouvez demander une copie de ces clauses contractuelles types en nous contactant comme indiqué ci-dessous.

En outre, nous nous engageons à nous conformer à toutes les exigences ou directives supplémentaires de la Cour de justice de l’Union européenne, de la législation applicable en matière de protection des données ou des autorités de contrôle en ce qui concerne le transfert de données à caractère personnel.

#### Onze gegevenspraktijken

##### Informatie die we verzamelen

We verzamelen sollicitanteninformatie die worden verstrekt door (1) u, ook via de carrièrepagina van Plaid (beschikbaar op https://plaid.com/careers/), (2) derden, zoals aanbieders van antecedentenonderzoek, wervingsconsulenten of professionele wervingsbureaus, of (3) Plaid zelf via sollicitantenonderzoek. We kunnen ook sollicitanteninformatie afleiden door een profiel aan te maken dat uw arbeidsvoorkeuren, eigenschappen, gedrag, intelligentie, capaciteiten en bekwaamheid weergeeft, bijvoorbeeld via notities die zijn gemaakt als onderdeel van de sollicitatieprocedure.

We verzamelen de volgende categorieën sollicitanteninformatie over sollicitanten die we overwegen voor vacatures:

* identificatiegegevens en contactinformatie, waaronder uw volledige naam, adres, telefoonnummer, e-mailadres of andere contactinformatie;
    
* professionele of werkgerelateerde informatie, inclusief informatie in uw cv, uw werkgeschiedenis, certificeringen, professionele licenties en andere ervaring, en contactgegevens van uw voormalige/huidige werkgever (wanneer dergelijke gegevens uw persoonsgegevens bevatten);
    
* opleidingsinformatie, waaronder informatie over uw diploma’s en training, transcripties en academische prestaties;
    
* sociale netwerken en soortgelijke informatie, zoals sociale media en openbare profielinformatie, waaronder URL’s met betrekking tot uw profiel op LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub en Portfolio en uw persoonlijke website;
    
* in bepaalde regio’s (bijvoorbeeld de VS) kunnen we demografische en andere gevoelige informatie verzamelen (bijv. ras, gender, veteranenstatus, etniciteit, seksuele geaardheid en handicapstatus);; en
    
* andere informatie die u indient, inclusief aanvullende informatie verstrekt in een sollicitatieformulier, begeleidende brief of ander werkproduct.
    

Als uw sollicitatie vordert, verzamelen we ook de volgende sollicitanteninformatie:

* informatie die wordt verzameld als onderdeel van de sollicitatieprocedure, bijvoorbeeld notities die worden gemaakt van uw sollicitatiegesprek (wanneer deze uw persoonsgegevens bevatten) en persoonsgegevens die zijn opgenomen in elk thuisproject;
    
* informatie die nodig is om uw sollicitatiegesprek te plannen, inclusief identificatiegegevens zoals uw adres, uw bekende reizigersnummer en eventuele frequente reizigersgegevens;
    
* audio- en visuele informatie, waaronder foto’s voor werkprofielen en beveiligingsbeelden die worden verzameld op het terrein van Plaid;
    
* informatie over elektronische netwerkactiviteiten en gebruiksgegevens, inclusief uw gebruik van apparatuur, apparaten, software en andere activa van Plaid.
    
* informatie over de verwachtingen ten aanzien van het dienstverband, inclusief, voor zover deze uw persoonsgegevens bevatten, het soort werk dat u zoekt, verwachtingen ten aanzien van vergoedingen, bereidheid om te verhuizen en andere functievoorkeuren;
    
* (indien en voor zover relevant voor een specifieke functie) informatie die nodig is om een antecedentenonderzoek uit te voeren, bijvoorbeeld informatie die van u is verkregen of door middel van referentie- en antecedentenonderzoeken, onder voorbehoud van eventuele verdere toestemmingen of kennisgevingen die vereist en/of toegestaan zijn door de toepasselijke wetgeving, meestal door middel van het verstrekken van een officieel certificaat van goed gedrag (bijvoorbeeld in Nederland: Verklaring omtrent gedrag of VOG); en
    
* informatie die nodig is om het dienstverband te starten, inclusief bewijs van geschiktheid om in een bepaald land te werken (zoals een paspoort of visum), demografische informatie zoals uw geboortedatum en -plaats en staatsburgerschap, identificatiegegevens zoals uw burgerservicenummer (indien vereist en/of toegestaan door de wet), nationaal verzekeringsnummer, andere door de overheid uitgegeven identificatiemiddelen, belastingidentificatiegegevens en gerelateerde belastinginformatie (indien vereist en/of toegestaan door de wet) en bankrekeningnummers en gerelateerde informatie, informatie over het in aanmerking komen voor secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden en andere informatie die u verstrekt met het oog op het begin van het dienstverband of de uitvoering van een arbeidsovereenkomst.
    

##### Hoe we uw informatie gebruiken

We gebruiken de sollicitanteninformatie die over u zijn verzameld om uw sollicitatie te verwerken en om te voldoen aan wettelijke verplichtingen die we hebben met betrekking tot uw sollicitatie, inclusief het bevestigen van uw geschiktheid om op een bepaalde locatie te werken.

We gebruiken uw sollicitatiegegevens ook voor de volgende doeleinden:

* het beheren en verwerken van uw sollicitatie, inclusief het verifiëren van uw identificatie, ervaring en andere informatie die u indient en, als uw sollicitatie vordert, alle informatie over sollicitatiegesprekken en antecedentenonderzoek;
    
* met u te communiceren over uw sollicitatie, inclusief contact met u opnemen via telefoon, e-mail of sociale-mediaplatforms over uw sollicitatie en, als uw sollicitatie vordert, het coördineren van sollicitatiegesprekken en antecedentenonderzoeken;
    
* beoordelen en evalueren van uw geschiktheid voor de functie waarop u hebt gesolliciteerd, of voor andere vacatures, inclusief het verifiëren van uw identificatie, ervaring en andere informatie die u indient en, als uw sollicitatie vordert, alle sollicitatiegesprekinformatie en antecedentenonderzoeksinformatie;
    
* uitvoeren van referentie- en antecedentenonderzoeken, inclusief strafbladcontroles, als onderdeel van uw sollicitatie, onderworpen aan de toepasselijke wetgeving, inclusief het verifiëren van uw identificatie, ervaring en andere informatie die u indient en, als uw sollicitatie vordert, sollicitatiegesprekinformatie en antecedentenonderzoeksinformatie;
    
* het naleven van toepasselijke wetten en arbeidsgerelateerde vereisten, waaronder het verifiëren van identificatiegegevens en informatie die nodig is om een dienstverband te initiëren, voor doeleinden zoals het bevestigen van de mogelijkheid om legaal te werken op een specifieke locatie, het opzetten van een salarisadministratie, inhoudingen en secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden en het voldoen aan wettelijke rapportagevereisten;
    
* het verbeteren van onze wervingsprocedure, zoals toegestaan door de toepasselijke wetgeving en alleen in bepaalde regio’s (zoals de VS), inclusief door het genereren van analyses met behulp van sollicitanteninformatie om te zorgen dat we een diverse reeks sollicitanten werven;
    
* u informeren over carrièremogelijkheden, waaronder andere vacatures waarvoor u eventueel in aanmerking komt; en
    
* voor enig ander vermeld doel met uw toestemming.
    

Houd er rekening mee dat als u een dienstverband bij Plaid accepteert, uw sollicitanteninformatie deel zullen uitmaken van uw arbeidsdossier en zullen worden gebruikt voor arbeidsdoeleinden in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving en elke toepasselijke privacyverklaring voor personeel. Als u echter niet wordt geaccepteerd voor een functie, kunnen we uw sollicitatie, inclusief relevante sollicitanteninformatie, nog steeds bewaren zodat we u kunnen overwegen voor andere carrièremogelijkheden bij Plaid en op voorwaarde dat, indien vereist door de toepasselijke wetgeving, we uw voorafgaande toestemming hebben verkregen voor een dergelijke langere bewaring van uw persoonsgegevens. Als u niet wilt dat uw informatie wordt bewaard indien u geen functie wordt aangeboden, waar van toepassing, raadpleeg dan de volgende secties hieronder voor opties die voor u beschikbaar kunnen zijn: [Gegevensbeschermingsrechten van sollicitanten in Californië](#gegevensbeschermingsrechten-van-sollicitanten-in-californië) en [Gegevensbeschermingsrechten van Britse, EER- en Canadese sollicitanten](#gegevensbeschermingsrechten-voor-sollicitanten-privacyverklaring-voor-sollicitanten).

Plaid gebruikt uw persoonsgegevens niet voor geautomatiseerde individuele besluitvorming (inclusief profilering).

##### Hoe we uw informatie openbaar maken

We maken uw persoonsgegevens als volgt of zoals anderszins beschreven in deze verklaring aan anderen bekend:

* aan Plaid en onze dochterondernemingen en gelieerde entiteiten, aangezien de specifieke entiteit waarbij u solliciteert deel uitmaakt van een bredere groep bedrijven met hoofdkantoor in de Verenigde Staten en kantoren in verschillende rechtsgebieden die personeelszaken en IT-systemen delen voor het verwerken van uw sollicitatie, het beoordelen van uw geschiktheid voor de functie en het initiëren van een dienstverband (indien van toepassing);
    
* aan onze gegevensverwerkers en andere dienstverleners, waaronder onze leveranciers van diensten voor gegevensanalyse en antecedentenonderzoek en wervingsbureaus, in verband met de diensten die zij voor ons of namens ons verrichten. Indien vereist, zijn deze dienstverleners, partners of verkopers die namens ons handelen onderworpen aan contractuele verplichtingen om passende technische en organisatorische maatregelen te implementeren om de sollicitanteninformatie te beschermen, en om deze alleen volgens de instructies te verwerken.
    
* aan wetshandhavingsinstanties, overheidsinstanties, regelgevende instanties en andere derden, zoals rechtbanken en andere autoriteiten, onafhankelijke externe adviseurs en interne nalevings- en onderzoeksteams, als we denken dat een dergelijke openbaarmaking in overeenstemming is met of op een andere manier vereist is door toepasselijke wet- en regelgeving of juridische procedures;
    
* in verband met, of tijdens de onderhandelingen over, een fusie, verkoop van bedrijfsmiddelen, consolidatie of herstructurering, financiering of overname van het gehele of een deel van ons bedrijf door of in een ander bedrijf, voor zover toegestaan, door de toepasselijke wetgeving;
    
* indien nodig om Plaid te beschermen, inclusief om potentiële, dreigende of feitelijke juridische vorderingen vast te stellen, uit te oefenen of te verdedigen;
    
* om een contract met u af te dwingen of als wij van mening zijn dat uw acties niet in overeenstemming zijn met onze beleidslijnen;
    
* om te reageren op vorderingen, om onze rechten of de rechten van een derde partij te beschermen, om de veiligheid van een persoon te beschermen of om illegale activiteiten te voorkomen; of
    
* voor enig ander vermeld doel met uw toestemming of op uw aanwijzing.
    

We kunnen ook geaggregeerde, geanonimiseerde of niet-identificeerbaar gemaakte informatie gebruiken of openbaar maken die niet redelijkerwijs kan worden gebruikt om u te identificeren, voor zover toegestaan volgens de toepasselijke wetgeving.

##### Onze wettelijke grondslagen voor verwerking (alleen voor sollicitanten uit het VK en de EER)

Voor sollicitanten in het Verenigd Koninkrijk (“VK”) en de Europese Economische Ruimte (“EER”), hangt onze rechtsgrond voor het verzamelen, gebruiken en doorgeven van sollicitanteninformatie af van de betreffende informatie en de context waarin we deze hebben verzameld of verwerkt. Normaal gesproken verzamelen en verwerken we echter in het algemeen alleen sollicitanteninformatie wanneer:

(a) we moeten voldoen aan wettelijke verplichtingen die op ons van toepassing zijn (zoals toepasselijke immigratie- en/of arbeidswet- en regelgeving);

(b) we de informatie nodig hebben om te voldoen aan onze verantwoordelijkheden in een feitelijke of toekomstige overeenkomst met u (zoals een arbeidsovereenkomst of een aanbod van werk als u in aanmerking komt voor een dienstverband);

(c) de verwerking noodzakelijk is voor onze rechtmatige belangen en niet wordt opgeheven door uw belangen op het gebied van gegevensbescherming of fundamentele rechten en vrijheden (zoals het garanderen van een veilige werkomgeving voor al onze teamleden en ter verzekering van de betrouwbaarheid van onze sollicitanten en voor het anderszins beheren en verwerken van uw sollicitatie, of om met u over uw sollicitatie te communiceren); en

(d) we uw toestemming hebben om dit te doen (in gevallen waarin uw toestemming geheel vrijelijk wordt gegeven).

Wanneer het ons wettelijk is toegestaan of we verplicht zijn om speciale categorieën gegevens te verzamelen en te verwerken (bijvoorbeeld ras), verwerken we dergelijke informatie alleen:

* wanneer we dit redelijkerwijs moeten doen om te voldoen aan onze wettelijke verplichtingen als toekomstige werkgever;
    
* wanneer we dit moeten doen om op de hoogte te worden gebracht van uw arbeidscapaciteit;
    
* wanneer we dit moeten doen om de vitale belangen van u of een andere persoon te beschermen (en we uw toestemming niet kunnen verkrijgen); of
    
* wanneer u ons uw toestemming hebt gegeven (in gevallen waarin uw toestemming geheel vrijelijk wordt gegeven).
    

Voor zover wij ons baseren op toestemming om sollicitanteninformatie te verzamelen en te verwerken, hebt u het recht om uw toestemming te weigeren of om uw toestemming op elk moment in te trekken door contact met ons op te nemen via [people-privacy@plaid.com](mailto:people-privacy@plaid.com). Het intrekken van uw toestemming heeft echter geen invloed op de rechtmatigheid van de verwerking die wij voor uw intrekking hebben uitgevoerd, noch op de verwerking van uw persoonsgegevens voor andere doeleinden, uitgevoerd op grond van andere rechtmatige verwerkingsgronden dan toestemming.

##### Onze bewaarpraktijken

We bewaren sollicitanteninformatie niet langer dan nodig is om te voldoen aan het doel waarvoor deze is verzameld en gebruikt, zoals beschreven in deze verklaring, tenzij een langere bewaartermijn is vereist of toegestaan krachtens de toepasselijke wetgeving. Echter, zoals hierboven vermeld, als u een dienstverband bij Plaid accepteert, wordt uw sollicitanteninformatie een deel van uw arbeidsdossier en wordt gebruikt voor arbeidsdoeleinden in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving en eventuele toepasselijke privacyverklaring voor personeel.

#### Overige details

##### Internationale gegevensoverdrachten

We zijn internationaal actief en voeren daarom overdracht van sollicitanteninformatie uit over internationale grenzen, onder andere van het VK, de EER en/of Canada naar de Verenigde Staten voor verwerking en opslag. Voor zover sollicitanteninformatie wordt overgedragen van het VK of de EER naar gebieden/landen waarvoor de Europese Commissie en/of de minister van binnenlandse zaken in het VK (in voorkomend geval) niet heeft vastgesteld dat het wettelijke kader in dat gebied/land adequate bescherming biedt voor de rechten en vrijheden van personen voor hun persoonsgegevens, dragen we dergelijke gegevens over in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming, onder meer door het gebruik van door de Europese Commissie en/of de minister van binnenlandse zaken in het VK goedgekeurde (in voorkomend geval) standaardcontractbepalingen (indien van toepassing). U kunt om een kopie van deze standaardcontractbepalingen vragen door contact op te nemen zoals hieronder uiteengezet.

Daarnaast zetten we ons in om ervoor te zorgen dat we voldoen aan alle aanvullende voorschriften of richtlijnen van het Europees Hof van Justitie, de wetgeving voor gegevensbescherming en/of toezichthoudende autoriteiten met betrekking tot de overdracht van persoonsgegevens.

##### Gegevensbeschermingsrechten van sollicitanten in Californië

De California Consumer Privacy Act of “CCPA”, zoals gewijzigd door de California Privacy Rights Act, biedt sollicitanten die in Californië wonen bepaalde rechten met betrekking tot hun sollicitanteninformatie. Als u inwoner van Californië bent, is dit gedeelte op u van toepassing.

We verzamelen of hebben in de afgelopen 12 maanden de categorieën sollicitanteninformatie verzameld die in de onderstaande tabel worden vermeld uit de bronnen die worden geïdentificeerd in het gedeelte “Informatie die we verzamelen”. Voor details over de precieze gegevenspunten die we verzamelen of in de afgelopen 12 maanden hebben verzameld, raadpleeg dan het gedeelte “Informatie die we verzamelen” hierboven. We gebruiken en maken de sollicitanteninformatie bekend voor de zakelijke en commerciële doeleinden die in de volgende tabel worden vermeld en we maken de sollicitanteninformatie bekend aan de ontvangers die ook in de volgende tabel worden vermeld.

![Kandidaat Informatie tabel](/_next/image?url=/assets/img/legal/candidate-privacy-notice/candidate-information-table-nl@2x.png&w=1920&q=75)

We bewaren de categorieën sollicitanteninformatie in overeenstemming met de hierboven beschreven bewaarpraktijken in [Onze bewaarpraktijken](#onze-bewaarpraktijken-privacyverklaring-voor-sollicitanten).

Plaid (1) “verkoopt” geen sollicitanteninformatie en “geeft” deze niet “door” en (2) gebruikt of maakt gevoelige persoonlijke informatie niet openbaar voor enig ander doel dan wat wordt gespecificeerd in CCPA-sectie 1798.121(a) (zoals deze termen worden gedefinieerd door de CCPA).

Onder voorbehoud van bepaalde beperkingen hebt u het recht om (a) te verzoeken om meer te weten te komen over de bronnen van en de categorieën en specifieke stukjes sollicitanteninformatie die we verzamelen, gebruiken en openbaar maken en de categorieën derden aan wie we dergelijke informatie bekendmaken, (b) te verzoeken om verwijdering van sollicitanteninformatie, (c) te verzoeken om correctie van onjuiste sollicitanteninformatie, en (d) niet te worden gediscrimineerd voor het uitoefenen van deze rechten. U kunt deze verzoeken indienen door een e-mail te sturen naar people-privacy@plaid.com, dit [webformulier](https://plaid.com/legal/data-protection-request-form-nl/) in te vullen of te bellen naar +1 (415) 799 - 1354. We zullen uw verzoek verifiëren door u te vragen informatie te verstrekken met betrekking tot uw recente interacties met ons, zoals uw telefoonnummer en e-mailadres. We discrimineren u niet als u uw rechten krachtens de CCPA uitoefent.

Als we uw verzoek ontvangen van een gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger die geen geldige volmacht verstrekt, kunnen we de gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger vragen om bewijs te leveren dat u de vertegenwoordiger ondertekende toestemming hebt gegeven om het verzoek in te dienen om namens u rechten uit te oefenen. Bij gebrek aan een geldige volmacht kunnen we u ook vragen om uw eigen identiteit rechtstreeks bij ons te verifiëren of aan ons te bevestigen dat u anderszins de gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger toestemming hebt gegeven om het verzoek in te dienen. Als u een gemachtigde vertegenwoordiger bent die een verzoek wil indienen, stuur dan een e-mail naar [people-privacy@plaid.com](mailto:people-privacy@plaid.com).

##### Gegevensbeschermingsrechten voor sollicitanten in het VK, de EER en Canada

Krachtens de toepasselijke wetgeving hebt u bepaalde rechten met betrekking tot uw sollicitanteninformatie. Deze rechten kunnen per land en provincie verschillen.

Onderhevig aan bepaalde beperkingen en uitzonderingen, omvatten die rechten het recht om: (i) te weten of we persoonsgegevens over u verwerken; (ii) toegang te vragen tot of rectificatie van de persoonsgegevens die we over u verwerken; (iii) bezwaar te maken tegen, of te verzoeken dat we de verwerking van uw persoonsgegevens beperken; (iv) ons te verzoeken persoonsgegevens over u te verwijderen; (v) te verzoeken dat wij de persoonsgegevens die u aan ons hebt verstrekt, verstrekken in een gestructureerd, algemeen gebruikt en machinaal leesbaar formaat, voor verzending naar een andere verwerkingsverantwoordelijke; (vi) uw toestemming op elk moment in te trekken wanneer onze verwerking gebaseerd is op uw toestemming; en (vii) een klacht in te dienen bij uw lokale toezichthoudende autoriteit (als u in het VK bent, raadpleeg dan deze [pagina](https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/) voor contactinformatie voor het Britse Information Commissioner’s Office en als u in de EER bent, raadpleeg dan deze [pagina](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en) voor contactinformatie voor toezichthoudende instanties van de EU).

Als u uw rechten wilt uitoefenen, neem dan contact met ons op via de onderstaande contactinformatie.

We geven u graag op uw verzoek een meer gedetailleerd overzicht van onze relevante verwerkingsdoeleinden (evenals de gerelateerde categorieën gegevens, bewaartermijnen en wettelijke verwerkingsgronden).

##### Wijzigingen in deze verklaring

We kunnen deze privacyverklaring voor sollicitanten van tijd tot tijd wijzigen. Als we wijzigingen aanbrengen, veranderen we de ingangsdatum bovenaan deze verklaring. Bovendien, als een van de wijzigingen van wezenlijk belang is en van invloed is op uw sollicitanteninformatie, sturen we u ook een kopie via e-mail.

#### Unsere Datenpraxis

##### Informationen, die wir erfassen

Wir erfassen Bewerberinformationen, die von (1) Ihnen wie insbesondere über Plaids Karriereseite (zugänglich unter https://plaid.com/careers/), (2) Dritten wie etwa Anbietern von Hintergrundüberprüfungen, Rekrutierungsberatern oder professionellen Rekrutierungsagenturen oder (3) Plaid selbst im Wege von Bewerberrecherchen geliefert bzw. beschafft werden. Wir können auch Bewerberinformationen ableiten, indem wir ein Profil erstellen, das Ihre Beschäftigungspräferenzen, Eigenschaften, Verhaltensweisen, Intelligenz, Fähigkeiten und Eignungen widerspiegelt, wie z. B. mithilfe von Notizen, die im Rahmen des Interviewprozesses angefertigt werden.

Wir erfassen die folgenden Kategorien von Bewerberinformationen über Bewerber, die wir für Stellen in Betracht ziehen:

* Identifikatoren und Kontaktinformationen, einschließlich Ihres vollständigen Namens, Ihrer Adresse, Telefonnummer, E-Mail-Adresse oder anderer Kontaktinformationen,
    
* berufliche oder beschäftigungsrelevante Informationen, einschließlich Informationen in Ihrem Lebenslauf, Ihres beruflichen Werdegangs, Zeugnissen, beruflicher Zulassungen und anderer Erfahrungen sowie Kontaktdaten Ihres ehemaligen/derzeitigen Arbeitgebers (wenn diese Angaben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten enthalten),
    
* Ausbildungsinformationen, einschließlich Informationen über Ihre Abschlüsse und Schulungen, Zeugnissen und Studienleistungen,
    
* Informationen aus sozialen Netzwerken und dergleichen, wie z. B. Informationen in sozialen Medien und öffentlichen Profilen, einschließlich URLs in Verbindung mit Ihren LinkedIn-, Twitter-, GitHub- und Portfolio-Profilen sowie Ihrer persönlichen Website,
    
* in bestimmten Regionen (wie den USA) können wir demografische und andere sensible Informationen (z. B. Ethnie, Geschlecht, Veteranenstatus, Volkszugehörigkeit, sexuelle Orientierung und Behinderungsstatus) erfassen; und
    
* andere von Ihnen eingereichte Informationen, einschließlich zusätzlicher Informationen, die in einem Bewerbungsformular, Anschreiben oder einem anderen Arbeitsprodukt enthalten sind.
    

Wenn Ihre Bewerbung die nächste Runde erreicht, erfassen wir außerdem die folgenden Bewerberinformationen:

* Informationen, die im Rahmen des Interviewprozesses erfasst werden, wie z. B. Notizen, die aus Ihrem Interview stammen (wenn sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten enthalten), und personenbezogene Daten, die in Take-home-Projekten enthalten sind,
    
* Informationen, die für die Planung Ihres Interviews erforderlich sind, einschließlich Identifikatoren wie etwa Ihre Adresse, Ihre Known-Traveler-Nummer und etwaige Vielreisende-Angaben,
    
* Audio- und visuelle Daten, einschließlich Fotos für Arbeitsprofile und Sicherheitsaufzeichnungen in den Räumlichkeiten von Plaid,
    
* Informationen zu elektronischen Netzwerkaktivitäten und Nutzungsdaten, einschließlich Ihrer Nutzung von Plaid-Ausrüstung, -Geräten, -Software und anderen -Vermögenswerten,
    
* Einzelheiten zu Beschäftigungserwartungen, einschließlich Art der angestrebten Beschäftigung, Vergütungserwartungen, Umzugsbereitschaft und anderer beruflicher Präferenzen, soweit darin Ihre personenbezogenen Daten enthalten sind,
    
* (sofern und soweit für eine bestimmte Rolle relevant) Informationen, die für die Vornahme einer Hintergrundüberprüfung erforderlich sind, wie z. B. Informationen, die entweder von Ihnen selbst oder im Wege von Referenz- und Hintergrundüberprüfungen beschafft werden, vorbehaltlich möglicher weiterer Genehmigungen oder Benachrichtigungen, die nach geltendem Recht erforderlich und/oder zulässig sind, in der Regel im Wege der Vorlage eines amtlichen Führungszeugnisses (z. B. in den Niederlanden: Verklaring Omtrent Gedrag bzw.VOG), und
    
* Informationen, die für die Aufnahme einer Beschäftigung erforderlich sind, einschließlich Nachweis der Berechtigung, in einem bestimmten Land zu arbeiten (z. B. Reisepass oder Visum), demografische Informationen, wie etwa Ihr Geburtsdatum und -ort sowie Ihre Staatsbürgerschaft, Identifikatoren, wie etwa Ihre Sozialversicherungsnummer (sofern nach geltendem Recht vorgeschrieben und/oder zulässig), nationale Versicherungsnummer, andere behördlich ausgestellte Kennungen, Steueridentifikationsnummern und zugehörige steuerliche Informationen (sofern nach geltendem Recht vorgeschrieben und/oder zulässig) sowie Bankkontonummern und damit verbundene Informationen, Informationen zur Anspruchsberechtigung bezüglich Leistungen und sonstige Informationen, die Sie für Zwecke der Aufnahme des Beschäftigungsverhältnisses oder der Unterzeichnung eines Arbeitsvertrags liefern.
    

##### Wie wir Ihre Informationen nutzen

Wir verwenden die über Sie erfassten Bewerberinformationen, um Ihre Bewerbung für eine Anstellung zu bearbeiten und um gesetzliche Verpflichtungen zu erfüllen, denen wir im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Bewerbung unterliegen, einschließlich der Überprüfung Ihrer Berechtigung, an einem bestimmten Standort zu arbeiten.

Wir werden Ihre Bewerberinformationen ferner für die folgenden Zwecke verwenden:

* Verwaltung und Bearbeitung Ihrer Bewerbung, einschließlich Überprüfung Ihrer Identifikation, Erfahrung und anderer von Ihnen übermittelten Informationen sowie, falls Ihre Bewerbung die nächste Runde erreicht, aller Interview- und Hintergrundüberprüfungsinformationen,
    
* Kommunikation mit Ihnen zu Ihrer Bewerbung, einschließlich Kontaktaufnahme mit Ihnen per Telefon, E-Mail oder Social-Media-Plattformen zu Ihrer Bewerbung und, falls Ihre Bewerbung die nächste Runde erreicht, Koordination von Interviews und Hintergrundüberprüfungen,
    
* Beurteilung und Bewertung Ihrer Eignung für die Stelle, für die Sie sich beworben haben, oder für andere offene Stellen, einschließlich der Überprüfung Ihrer Identifikation, Erfahrung und anderer von Ihnen übermittelten Informationen sowie, falls Ihre Bewerbung die nächste Runde erreicht, aller Interview- und Hintergrundüberprüfungsinformationen,
    
* Vornahme von Referenz- und Hintergrundprüfungen, einschließlich Vorstrafenregister, im Rahmen Ihrer Bewerbung, unter Berücksichtigung geltenden Rechts, einschließlich der Überprüfung Ihrer Identifikation, Erfahrung und anderer von Ihnen übermittelten Informationen sowie, falls Ihre Bewerbung die nächste Runde erreicht, aller Interview- und Hintergrundüberprüfungsinformationen,
    
* Einhaltung maßgeblicher Gesetze und beschäftigungsrelevanter Auflagen, einschließlich Überprüfung von Identifikationsinformationen sowie von Informationen, die zur Aufnahme einer Beschäftigung und für Zwecke wie etwa die Überprüfung Ihrer Fähigkeit, an einem bestimmten Standort auf legale Weise zu arbeiten, die Einrichtung von Gehaltsabrechnungen, Einbehaltungen und Sozialleistungen und die Befolgung gesetzlicher Meldepflichten benötigt werden,
    
* Verbesserung unserer Einstellungsverfahren, soweit nach geltendem Recht zulässig und nur in bestimmten Regionen (wie den USA), wie insbesondere im Wege der Erstellung von Analysen unter Verwendung von Bewerberinformationen, um sicherzustellen, dass wir eine Reihe unterschiedlicher Bewerber rekrutieren,
    
* Versendung von Mitteilungen zu beruflichen Chancen an Sie, darunter auch zu anderen Stellen, für die Sie möglicherweise geeignet sind, und
    
* für andere mitgeteilte Zwecke, wenn wir über Ihre Einwilligung verfügen.
    

Bitte beachten Sie, dass Ihre Bewerberinformationen Teil Ihrer Beschäftigungsakte und für Beschäftigungszwecke im Einklang mit geltendem Recht und allen maßgeblichen Datenschutzerklärungen für Mitarbeiter verwendet werden, wenn Sie eine Beschäftigung bei Plaid annehmen. Sollten Sie jedoch nicht für eine Stelle akzeptiert werden, können wir Ihre Bewerbung einschließlich relevanter Bewerberinformationen weiterhin aufbewahren, damit wir Sie für andere Karrieremöglichkeiten bei Plaid in Betracht ziehen können, sofern wir, falls dies nach maßgeblichen Gesetzen vorgeschrieben ist, Ihre vorherige Einwilligung für eine solche längere Aufbewahrung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten eingeholt haben. Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass Ihre Daten gespeichert werden, falls Ihnen keine Stelle angeboten wird, finden Sie in den folgenden Abschnitten Optionen, die Ihnen möglicherweise zur Verfügung stehen: [Datenschutzrechte von Bewerbern aus Kalifornien](#datenschutzrechte-von-bewerbern-in-kalifornien) und [Datenschutzrechte von Bewerbern aus Großbritannien, dem EWR und Kanada](#datenschutzrechte-von-bewerbern-datenschutzerklärung-für-bewerber).

Plaid verwendet Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht für eine automatisierte individuelle Entscheidungsfindung (einschließlich Profiling).

##### An wen wir Ihre Informationen weitergeben

Wir geben Ihre personenbezogenen Daten wie folgt oder wie ansonsten in dieser Erklärung beschrieben an andere weiter:

* zwischen Plaid und unseren Tochtergesellschaften und verbundenen Unternehmen, da die spezifische Organisation, bei der Sie sich bewerben, Teil einer breiteren Gruppe von Unternehmen mit Hauptsitz in den Vereinigten Staaten und Niederlassungen in verschiedenen Ländern ist, die Personal- und IT-Systeme zur Bearbeitung Ihrer Bewerbung, Beurteilung Ihrer Eignung für die Rolle und Aufnahme einer Beschäftigungsbeziehung (falls zutreffend) teilen,
    
* an unsere Datenverarbeiter und andere Dienstleister, einschließlich Anbietern für Datenanalysen und Hintergrundüberprüfungen sowie Rekrutierungsagenturen, in Verbindung mit den Dienstleistungen, die sie für uns oder in unserem Auftrag ausführen. Soweit erforderlich sind diese Dienstleister, Partner oder Anbieter, die in unserem Namen handeln, vertraglich verpflichtet, angemessene technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Bewerberinformationen zu ergreifen und dürfen diese nur nach Anweisung verarbeiten,
    
* an Strafverfolgungsbehörden, Regierungsbehörden, Aufsichtsbehörden und andere Drittanbieter, wie z. B. Gerichte und andere Behörden, unabhängige externe Berater und interne Compliance- und Untersuchungsteams, wenn eine solche Weitergabe nach unserer Auffassung im Einklang mit maßgeblichen Gesetzen, Vorschriften oder gerichtlichen Verfügungen geschieht oder ansonsten von diesen vorgeschrieben ist,
    
* in Verbindung mit oder während der Verhandlungen über einen Firmenzusammenschluss, einen Verkauf von Unternehmensteilen, eine Konsolidierung oder Umstrukturierung, eine Finanzierung oder eine Übernahme des gesamten oder eines Teils unseres Geschäfts durch oder in ein anderes Unternehmen, soweit dies nach geltendem Recht zulässig ist,
    
* soweit dies zum Schutz von Plaid, erforderlich ist, einschließlich zur Begründung, Ausübung oder Abwehr potenzieller, drohender oder tatsächlicher Rechtsansprüche,
    
* um Verträge mit Ihnen durchzusetzen oder wenn wir annehmen, dass Ihre Vorgehensweisen nicht mit unseren Richtlinien vereinbar sind;
    
* um auf Forderungen zu reagieren, um unsere Rechte oder die Rechte eines Drittanbieters zu schützen, um die Sicherheit von Personen zu schützen oder um illegale Aktivitäten zu verhindern; oder
    
* für jeden anderen mitgeteilten Zweck, sei es mit Ihrer Zustimmung oder auf Ihre Anweisung.
    

Wir können außerdem aggregierte, anonymisierte oder de-identifizierte Informationen verwenden oder weitergeben, die ohne großen Aufwand nicht dazu verwendet werden können, um Sie zu identifizieren, soweit dies nach geltendem Recht zulässig ist.

##### Unsere Rechtsgrundlagen für die Verarbeitung (nur Bewerber aus dem Vereinigten Königreich und dem EWR)

Bei Bewerbern im Vereinigten Königreich (United Kingdom, „UK”) und im Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum („EWR”) hängt unsere Rechtsgrundlage für die Erfassung, Verwendung und Weitergabe von Bewerberinformationen von den betreffenden Daten und dem Kontext ab, in dem wir sie erfasst oder verarbeitet haben. Grundsätzlich gilt jedoch, dass wir Bewerberinformationen nur dann erfassen und verarbeiten werden, wenn:

(a) wir die für uns geltenden rechtlichen Verpflichtungen erfüllen müssen (z. B. geltende Einwanderungs- und/oder Arbeitsgesetze und -vorschriften),

(b) wir die Informationen benötigen, um unseren Verpflichtungen aus existierenden oder potenziellen Vereinbarungen mit Ihnen nachzukommen (wie z. B. einem Arbeitsvertrag oder einem Beschäftigungsangebot, wenn Sie für eine Beschäftigung in Betracht gezogen werden),

(c) die Verarbeitung für unsere berechtigten Interessen erforderlich ist und Ihre Datenschutzinteressen oder Grundrechte und -freiheiten nicht überwiegen (z. B. um ein sicheres Arbeitsumfeld für alle unsere Teammitglieder und die Vertrauenswürdigkeit unserer Bewerber sicherzustellen und im Übrigen Ihr Bewerbung zu verwalten und zu bearbeiten oder mit Ihnen wegen Ihrer Bewerbung in Kontakt zu treten) und

(d) wir Ihre diesbezügliche Einwilligung eingeholt haben (in Fällen, in denen Ihre Einwilligung wirklich freiwillig gegeben wird).

Wenn es uns nach geltendem Recht erlaubt oder vorgeschrieben ist, spezielle Datenkategorien (z. B. ethnische Zugehörigkeit) zu erfassen und zu verarbeiten, werden diese Informationen von uns nur verarbeitet,

* wenn wir dies vernünftigerweise tun müssen, um unseren gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen als potenzieller Arbeitgeber nachzukommen,
    
* wenn wir dies tun müssen, um über Ihre Arbeitsfähigkeit informiert zu sein,
    
* wenn wir dies tun müssen, um Ihre lebenswichtigen Interessen oder die einer anderen Person zu schützen (und wir nicht in der Lage sind, Ihre Einwilligung einzuholen), oder
    
* wenn Sie uns Ihre Einwilligung gegeben haben (in Fällen, in denen Ihre Einwilligung wirklich freiwillig gegeben wurde).
    

Soweit wir uns auf eine Einwilligung zur Erhebung und Verarbeitung von Bewerberinformationen stützen, haben Sie das Recht, Ihre Einwilligung zu verweigern oder jederzeit zu widerrufen, indem Sie uns per E-Mail an [people-privacy@plaid.com](mailto:people-privacy@plaid.com) kontaktieren. Der Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung hat jedoch keinen Einfluss auf die Rechtmäßigkeit der Verarbeitung, die wir vor Ihrem Widerruf durchgeführt haben, und auch nicht auf die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, die auf der Grundlage anderer rechtmäßiger Verarbeitungsgründe als der Einwilligung für andere Zwecke stattgefunden hat.

##### Unsere Aufbewahrungspraktiken

Wir bewahren Bewerberinformationen nur so lange auf, wie es für die Erfüllung des Zwecks, für den sie erhoben und genutzt wurden, erforderlich ist, wie in dieser Erklärung beschrieben, es sei denn, eine längere Aufbewahrungsfrist ist nach geltendem Recht erforderlich oder zulässig. Wenn Sie eine Beschäftigung bei Plaid annehmen, werden Ihre Bewerberinformationen, wie bereits zuvor angesprochen, jedoch Teil Ihrer Beschäftigungsakte und für Beschäftigungszwecke im Einklang mit geltendem Recht und allen maßgeblichen Datenschutzerklärungen für Mitarbeiter verwendet.

#### Andere Hinweise

##### Internationale Datenübermittlung

Wir sind international tätig und übermitteln Bewerberinformationen daher über internationale Grenzen hinweg, einschließlich aus dem UK, dem EWR und/oder aus Kanada in die Vereinigten Staaten, um sie zu verarbeiten und zu speichern. Soweit Bewerberinformationen aus dem UK oder dem EWR in Gebiete/Länder übermittelt werden, für die die EU-Kommission und/oder das britische Außenministerium (je nach Sachlage) nicht festgestellt hat, dass der Rechtsrahmen in diesem Gebiet/Land einen angemessenen Schutz der Rechte und Freiheiten natürlicher Personen in Bezug auf ihre personenbezogenen Daten bietet, werden wir diese Daten im Einklang mit den geltenden Datenschutzgesetzen übermitteln, unter anderem durch die Verwendung der von der EU-Kommission und/oder dem britischen Außenministerium (je nach Sachlage) genehmigten Standardvertragsklauseln (falls zutreffend). Sie können eine Kopie dieser Standardvertragsklauseln anfordern, wenn Sie uns wie unten beschrieben kontaktieren.

Darüber hinaus verpflichten wir uns, sicherzustellen, dass wir alle zusätzlichen Anforderungen oder Leitlinien des Europäischen Gerichtshofs, des Datenschutzgesetzes und/oder der Aufsichtsbehörden in Bezug auf die Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten einhalten.

##### Datenschutzrechte von Bewerbern in Kalifornien

Das kalifornische Gesetz zum Schutz der Daten von Verbrauchern (California Consumer Privacy Act, „CCPA”) in der durch das kalifornische Datenschutzgesetz geänderten Fassung gewährt Bewerbern mit Wohnsitz in Kalifornien bestimmte Rechte in Bezug auf ihre Bewerberinformationen. Wenn Sie in Kalifornien ansässig sind, gilt dieser Abschnitt für Sie.

Wir beziehen bzw. haben in den letzten 12 Monaten die in der nachstehenden Tabelle aufgeführten Kategorien von Bewerberinformationen erhoben, und zwar von Quellen, die im Abschnitt „Informationen, die wir erfassen” genannt werden. Einzelheiten zu den genauen Datenpunkten, die wir beziehen bzw. in den letzten 12 Monaten bezogen haben, finden Sie im vorstehenden Abschnitt „Informationen, die wir erfassen”. Die Bewerberinformationen werden von uns für die in der folgenden Tabelle aufgeführten geschäftlichen und kommerziellen Zwecke verwendet und weitergegeben, und wir geben diese Informationen an die Empfänger weiter, die ebenfalls in der folgenden Tabelle aufgeführt sind.

![Kandidaten informations tabelle](/_next/image?url=/assets/img/legal/candidate-privacy-notice/candidate-information-table-de@2x.png&w=1920&q=75)

Wir bewahren die Kategorien von Bewerberinformationen im Einklang mit den oben in [Unsere Aufbewahrungspraktiken](#unsere-aufbewahrungspraktiken-datenschutzerklärung-für-bewerber) beschriebenen Aufbewahrungspraktiken auf.

Plaid (1) „verkauft” oder „teilt” (im Sinne der Definition dieser Begriffe im CCPA) keine Bewerberinformationen und (2) verwendet keine sensiblen personenbezogenen Daten für andere Zwecke als die in Paragraf 1798.121(a) des CCPA angegebenen und gibt sie auch nicht für andere Zwecke weiter.

Vorbehaltlich bestimmter Einschränkungen haben Sie das Recht, (a) mehr über die Quellen sowie die Kategorien und spezifischen Teile von Bewerberinformationen, die wir erheben, verwenden und weitergeben, und die Kategorien von Dritten, an die wir solche Informationen weitergeben, zu erfahren, (b) die Löschung von Bewerberinformationen zu verlangen, (c) die Korrektur ungenauer Bewerberinformationen zu verlangen und (d) wegen der Ausübung dieser Rechte nicht diskriminiert zu werden. Sie können diese Anträge stellen, indem Sie uns eine E-Mail an people-privacy@plaid.com senden, dieses [Webformular](https://plaid.com/legal/data-protection-request-form/) ausfüllen oder unter der Nummer +1-415-799-1354 anrufen. Wir werden Ihre Anträge überprüfen, indem wir Sie bitten, uns Informationen zu Ihren kürzlich erfolgten Interaktionen mit uns zu liefern, wie z. B. Ihre Telefonnummer und E-Mail-Adresse. Wir werden Sie nicht unangemessen benachteiligen, wenn Sie Ihre Rechte aus dem CCPA ausüben.

Wenn wir Ihren Antrag von einem bevollmächtigten Vertreter erhalten, der keine gültige Vollmacht vorlegt, können wir den Vertreter auffordern, den Nachweis dafür zu erbringen, dass Sie ihm eine unterzeichnete Erlaubnis erteilt haben, den Antrag zur Ausübung von Rechten in Ihrem Namen einzureichen. In Ermangelung einer gültigen Vollmacht können wir auch Sie auffordern, Ihre eigene Identität direkt bei uns zu verifizieren oder uns andernfalls zu bestätigen, dass Sie dem bevollmächtigten Vertreter die Erlaubnis erteilt haben, den Antrag einzureichen. Wenn Sie ein bevollmächtigter Vertreter sind, der einen Antrag stellen möchte, senden Sie uns bitte eine E-Mail an [people-privacy@plaid.com](mailto:people-privacy@plaid.com).

For residents of Illinois or Texas, if we require you to provide us with any document that contains your photograph or if you need to verify your identity by providing a photograph or video of yourself, the data derived from your face that we and our service providers collect and process on our behalf may be considered biometric data in some places. Your data will be stored no longer than three years, unless required by law.

**Information we receive when you test our technology**. Sometimes people who build applications using our services will use their own login information for their bank account or other financial account to test and evaluate how our technology will appear and operate in their application.

##### Our Lawful Bases for Processing in the EEA and UK

Plaid only processes your personal information when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Our legal basis for processing the information we collect will depend on what information we collected and the context for processing it. Generally, we only collect and process information where:

* we need to fulfill our responsibilities and obligations in any contract or agreement with you;
    
* to comply with our legal obligations under applicable law;
    
* the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (for example, to provide or update our services); and
    
* you have given your consent to do so.
    

##### How We Share Your Information

We share information about you as follows:

* With other companies or individuals as service providers, contractors, or business partners to provide services for us and help support our business. We also share information with collection agencies in the event of delinquent payments from our developers.
    
* If we believe in good faith that disclosure is appropriate to comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena). This includes disclosure in connection with requests from law enforcement or other governmental authorities;
    
* If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of Plaid or others;
    
* In the event of a change in ownership or control of all or part of our business (such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or bankruptcy);
    
* Between Plaid and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control or ownership; and
    
* With your consent or at your direction.
    

We also collect, use, and share information that has been aggregated and de-identified in a way so it cannot be used to identify you, for any purpose permitted under applicable law.

We may share Personal Data with third parties or allow them to collect Personal Data from our sites or services, as described above.

This table explains how we have collected and shared personal information in the last 12 months.

#### Unsere Datenpraxis

##### Gesammelte Informationen und Kategorien von Datenquellen

**Daten, die Sie uns mitteilen**: Wir erheben Daten, die Sie Plaid direkt übermitteln. Sie geben beispielsweise personenbezogene Daten an, wenn Sie ein Entwicklerkonto erstellen, unser Formular „Kontakt“ ausfüllen, sich für unsere E-Mails anmelden, Kundensupport anfordern, sich für die Abrechnung anmelden oder anderweitig mit uns kommunizieren. Zu den Arten von Daten, die wir erheben, gehören:

* Identifikatoren (wie der vollständige Name, E-Mail-Adresse, Postanschrift, Telefonnummer und Geburtsdatum);
    
* sensible Informationen (wie eine Führerscheinnummer und Steueridentifikationsnummer, Finanzkontoinformationen und Sozialversicherungsnummern, die für die Erbringung von Diensten erforderlich sind);
    
* berufliche Informationen (wie Firmenname und Titel); und
    
* alle anderen personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie zur Verfügung stellen (z. B. in Supportnachrichten für Entwickler).
    

Wir können auch bestimmte Unterlagen mit Ihrem Foto erheben oder Sie auffordern, Ihre Identität durch ein Foto oder ein Video von sich selbst zu bestätigen. Daten, die in diesem Zusammenhang erhoben werden, können in einigen Staaten oder Ländern als biometrische Daten angesehen werden, wie unten angegeben. Siehe den besonderen Hinweis für Einwohner von Illinois und Texas unten.

Besonderer Hinweis zu biometrischen Daten für Einwohner von Illinois und Texas

Für Einwohner von Illinois oder Texas gilt: Wenn wir von Ihnen die Vorlage eines Dokuments verlangen, das ein Foto von Ihnen enthält, oder wenn Sie Ihre Identität anhand eines Fotos oder eines Videos von sich selbst bestätigen müssen, können die von Ihrem Gesicht abgeleiteten Daten, die wir und unsere Dienstleister in unserem Namen erheben und verarbeiten, an einigen Orten als biometrische Daten gelten. Ihre Daten werden nicht länger als drei Jahre gespeichert, es sei denn, dies ist gesetzlich vorgeschrieben.

**Daten, die wir erhalten, wenn Sie unsere Technologie testen**: Manchmal verwenden Personen, die Anwendungen mit unseren Diensten erstellen, ihre eigenen Anmeldedaten für ihr Bankkonto oder ein anderes Finanzkonto, um zu testen und zu bewerten, wie unsere Technologie in ihrer Anwendung erscheint und funktioniert. Wenn Sie dies tun, sollten Sie unsere [Datenschutzerklärung für Endnutzer](#end-user-services-agreement-ewr-de) lesen, um zu erfahren, wie wir diese Daten erheben und handhaben.

**Daten, die wir erheben, wenn Sie unsere Dienste nutzen**: Wenn Sie unsere Dienste nutzen, werden die folgenden Daten über Sie erhoben:

* **Protokolldaten**: Wir erheben Protokolldateien, wenn Sie unsere Dienste nutzen. Dazu gehören Identifikatoren und Informationen über die elektronische Netzwerkaktivität, wie der von Ihnen verwendete Browsertyp, der Zeitpunkt Ihres Zugriffs auf unsere Dienste, die aufgerufenen Seiten und Ihre IP-Adresse.
    
* **Ungefährer Standort**: Wir bestimmen den ungefähren Standort des Geräts, mit dem Sie auf unsere Dienste zugreifen, anhand Ihrer IP-Adresse oder der Zeitzoneneinstellung Ihres Geräts.
    
* **Durch Cookies und andere Tracking-Technologien erhobene Daten**: Wir verwenden verschiedene Technologien wie Cookies und Web Beacons in unseren Diensten, um personenbezogene Daten zu erheben. Cookies sind kleine Datendateien, die über Ihren Webbrowser, auf Ihrer Festplatte oder im Speicher Ihres Geräts gespeichert werden und die es uns ermöglichen, unsere Dienste und Ihre Erfahrungen zu verbessern, die Nutzung unserer Dienste zu ermitteln und potenziell schädliches Verhalten zu überwachen und zu erkennen. Web Beacons sind elektronische Bilder, die in unseren Diensten oder E-Mails eingesetzt werden und uns dabei helfen, Cookies zu versenden. Web Beacons zählen, wie oft eine Webseite besucht wird, und helfen uns zu verstehen, wie unser Dienst genutzt wird, und ihn zu verbessern.
    
    * Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir Cookies von Drittanbietern für unsere Werbezwecke verwenden können, soweit dies gesetzlich zulässig ist und wie in unserer [Cookie-Richtlinie](#cookie-richtlinie) näher erläutert. Um Ihre Cookie-Einstellungen und -Präferenzen zu ändern, einschließlich derer für Targeting- und Werbe-Cookies, klicken Sie auf den Link „Cookie-Einstellungen“ in der Fußzeile der Seite.
        

**Daten, die wir aus anderen Quellen erheben**: Wir erheben auch Daten über Sie aus anderen Quellen ein. So können wir beispielsweise Daten von anderen Mitarbeitern Ihres Unternehmens und von Anbietern erheben, die uns dabei helfen, neue Geschäftskunden zu identifizieren, und zwar einschließlich Ihres Namens, Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse und der URL Ihres Profils in sozialen Medien.

##### Wie wir Ihre Daten nutzen

Wir verwenden die erhobenen Daten für die folgenden geschäftlichen und wirtschaftlichen Zwecke:

* um unsere Dienste zu betreiben, zu verbessern und zu entwickeln;
    
* um Ihre Identität zu überprüfen;
    
* um Entwicklern unsere Dienste in Rechnung zu stellen und um sie zu bezahlen;
    
* zur Einhaltung von Gesetzen, z. B. für Steuerzwecke;
    
* um Ihnen Dinge wie technische Hinweise, Updates, Sicherheitswarnungen und Nachrichten über Ihr Konto zu senden;
    
* um Ihre Anmerkungen, Fragen, Anfragen und Kundendienstanfragen zu beantworten;
    
* um die Dienste für Sie zu persönlicher zu gestalten;
    
* um mit Ihnen über Produkte, Dienste, Angebote und Plaid-Veranstaltungen zu kommunizieren, die wir anbieten oder sponsern;
    
* um Trends, Nutzung und Aktivitäten im Zusammenhang mit unseren Diensten zu überwachen und zu analysieren;
    
* um Betrug, böswillige Aktivitäten und andere illegale Aktivitäten aufzudecken und zu verhindern;
    
* um die Rechte, die Privatsphäre, die Sicherheit oder das Eigentum von Plaid und anderen zu schützen; und
    
* für andere Zwecke, über die wir Sie vor oder zum Zeitpunkt der Erhebung der Daten informieren.
    

##### Unsere Rechtsgrundlagen für die Verarbeitung im EWR und im Vereinigten Königreich

Plaid verarbeitet Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur, wenn wir eine gültige Rechtsgrundlage dafür haben. Unsere Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung der von uns erhobenen Daten hängt davon ab, welche Daten wir erhoben haben und in welchem Kontext wir sie verarbeiten. Grundsätzlich gilt, dass wir Daten nur dann erheben und verarbeiten, wenn:

* wir unsere Verantwortung und Verpflichtungen aus einem Vertrag oder einer Vereinbarung mit Ihnen erfüllen müssen;
    
* wir unseren gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen nach dem anwendbaren Recht nachkommen müssen;
    
* die Verarbeitung zur Wahrung unserer berechtigten Interessen erforderlich ist und Ihre Datenschutzinteressen oder Grundrechte und -freiheiten nicht überwiegen (z. B. zur Bereitstellung oder Aktualisierung unserer Dienste) und
    
* Sie Ihre Einwilligung dazu gegeben haben.
    

##### Wie wir Ihre Daten weitergeben

Wir geben Daten über Sie wie folgt weiter:

* An andere Unternehmen oder natürliche Personen wie Dienstleister, Auftragnehmer oder Geschäftspartner, die Dienstleistungen für uns erbringen und uns bei unserem Geschäft unterstützen. Wir geben auch Daten an Inkassobüros weiter, wenn unsere Entwickler mit Zahlungen im Rückstand sind.
    
* Wenn wir in gutem Glauben davon überzeugt sind, dass die Offenlegung angemessen ist, um anwendbare Gesetze, Vorschriften oder rechtliche Verfahren (wie Gerichtsbeschlüsse oder Vorladungen) zu erfüllen. Dies schließt die Offenlegung im Zusammenhang mit Anfragen von Strafverfolgungs- oder anderen Regierungsbehörden ein.
    
* Wenn wir der Meinung sind, dass Ihre Handlungen mit unseren Vereinbarungen oder Richtlinien unvereinbar sind, oder um die Rechte, die Privatsphäre, die Sicherheit oder das Eigentum von Plaid oder Dritter zu schützen.
    
* Im Falle einer Änderung der Eigentums- oder Beherrschungsverhältnisse in Bezug auf unser gesamtes oder einen Teil unseres Unternehmens (z. B. Fusion, Übernahme, Reorganisation oder Konkurs).
    
* Zwischen Plaid und unseren derzeitigen und zukünftigen Muttergesellschaften, verbundenen Unternehmen, Tochtergesellschaften und andere Unternehmen, die unter gemeinsamer Kontrolle oder in gemeinsamem Eigentum stehen, und
    
* mit Ihrer Zustimmung oder auf Ihre Weisung.
    

Wir erheben, verwenden und teilen auch Daten, die aggregiert und anonymisiert wurden, sodass sie nicht verwendet werden können, um Sie zu identifizieren, für jeden nach geltendem Recht zulässigen Zweck.

Wir können personenbezogene Daten an Dritte weitergeben oder ihnen erlauben, personenbezogene Daten von unseren Websites oder Dienstleistungen zu erheben, wie oben beschrieben.

In dieser Tabelle wird erläutert, wie wir in den letzten zwölf Monaten personenbezogene Daten erheben und weitergegeben haben.

#### Andere Hinweise

##### Chatbots, Werbung, Analysen und sonstige Dienste von Dritten

Wir gestatten Dritten, einschließlich Google Analytics, Analysen zu erstellen und Werbung auf unseren Websites zu schalten. Diese Dritten verwenden Cookies, Web-Beacons und andere Technologien, um Daten über Sie zu erheben. Plaid verwendet Chatbots, die von Drittanbietern betrieben werden.

Nähere Informationen darüber, wie wir Cookies verwenden und welche Möglichkeiten Sie haben, finden Sie in unserer [Cookie-Richtlinie](#cookie-richtlinie).

##### Internationale Datenübermittlung

Wir können die Daten, die wir über Sie erheben, zur Verarbeitung und Speicherung in andere Länder als das Land, in dem Sie leben, übertragen. Wenn wir Daten in ein Land oder Gebiet übertragen, das nicht über gleichwertige Datenschutzgesetze wie Ihr Land verfügt, werden wir diese Daten in Übereinstimmung mit den geltenden Datenschutzgesetzen übertragen. Insbesondere können wir von der EU-Kommission oder vom britischen Außenministerium genehmigte (je nach Fall) Standardvertragsklauseln verwenden, gegebenenfalls in Kombination mit zusätzlichen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen. Sie können eine Kopie dieser Standardvertragsklauseln anfordern, wenn Sie uns wie unten beschrieben kontaktieren.

##### Datenspeicherung

Wir bewahren Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht länger auf, als es für die Erreichung der Zwecke, für die sie erhoben wurden, erforderlich ist, es sei denn, das geltende Recht schreibt eine längere Aufbewahrungsfrist vor.

##### Ihre Wahlmöglichkeiten

* **Marketing-Kommunikationen**: Sie haben die Möglichkeit, den Erhalt von Marketing-E-Mails von Plaid anzunehmen oder abzulehnen, indem Sie die Anweisungen in diesen E-Mails befolgen. Wenn Sie sich dagegen entscheiden, können wir Ihnen weiterhin andere Arten von E-Mails senden, z. B. Support-, Service- und andere E-Mails über Ihr Konto oder unsere laufende Geschäftsbeziehung.
    

##### Ihre Datenschutzrechte

Sie haben möglicherweise Rechte in Bezug auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, einschließlich des Rechts, zu erfahren, wie wir Ihre Daten erheben, verwenden oder weitergeben. Darüber hinaus haben Sie möglicherweise das Recht, Zugang zu Ihren personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen sowie zu versuchen, diese Daten zu aktualisieren, zu löschen oder zu korrigieren. Wir werden Ihrer Anfrage zur Ausübung dieser Rechte unabhängig von Ihrem Standort nachkommen. Sie werden nicht diskriminiert, wenn Sie diese Rechte wahrnehmen.

In bestimmten Regionen, einschließlich des EWR und des Vereinigten Königreichs, stehen Ihnen möglicherweise zusätzliche Rechte zur Verfügung. Zu diesen Rechten gehört das Recht, der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu widersprechen oder zu verlangen, dass wir diese einschränken; die Einwilligung jederzeit zu widerrufen, wenn unsere Verarbeitung auf Ihrer Einwilligung basiert; und eine Beschwerde bei Ihrer lokalen Aufsichtsbehörde einzureichen (wenn Sie sich im EWR befinden, besuchen Sie bitte [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_nl](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_nl), und wenn Sie sich im Vereinigten Königreich befinden, besuchen Sie bitte [www.ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/) für Kontaktdaten).

Wenn Sie in Kalifornien ansässig sind, können Ihnen gemäß dem California Consumer Protection Act („CCPA“), wie durch den California Privacy Rights Act abgeändert, einige zusätzliche Rechte zur Verfügung stehen, vorbehaltlich der gesetzlich vorgesehenen Beschränkungen und Ausnahmen. Sie können auch Zugriff auf die Kategorien und spezifischen Teile der personenbezogenen Daten verlangen, die in den letzten zwölf Monaten über Sie erhoben wurden (einschließlich der personenbezogenen Daten, die für geschäftliche Zwecke weitergegeben wurden); Sie können erfahren, ob und an wen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten „verkauft“ oder „weitergegeben“ wurden; Sie können den „Verkauf“ oder die „Weitergabe“ Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten ablehnen, wenn ein Unternehmen Ihre Daten „verkauft“ oder „weitergibt“; und Sie können ein Unternehmen auffordern, ungenaue personenbezogene Daten zu korrigieren. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zwar nicht verkaufen, aber an Dritte für Werbezwecke anhand von „Cookies“ weitergeben können, wie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie beschrieben.

Wie oben unter „Ihre Wahlmöglichkeiten“ beschrieben, können Sie, wenn Sie einer unserer Entwickler sind, bequem auf Ihre Online-Kontoinformationen zugreifen, indem Sie sich bei Ihrem Konto anmelden oder uns kontaktieren.

Wenn Sie ein bevollmächtigter Vertreter sind und einen Antrag stellen möchten, setzen Sie sich bitte mit uns in Verbindung, wie unten im Abschnitt „Kontaktaufnahme mit Plaid“ beschrieben.

##### Nuestras bases legitimadoras para el tratamiento en el EEE y el Reino Unido

Plaid solo trata su información personal cuando tenemos una base legitimadora válida para hacerlo. Nuestra base legitimadora para el tratamiento de la información que recabamos dependerá de la información en cuestión y del contexto en que la tratamos. Por lo general, solo recabamos y tratamos información cuando:

* debemos cumplir nuestras responsabilidades y obligaciones en cualquier contrato o acuerdo celebrado con usted;
    
* debemos cumplir nuestras obligaciones legales en virtud de la legislación aplicable;
    
* el tratamiento es necesario para nuestros intereses legítimos y no prevalecen sus intereses de protección de datos o derechos y libertades fundamentales (por ejemplo, para prestar o actualizar nuestros Servicios); y
    
* nos ha dado su consentimiento para hacerlo.
    

##### Cómo compartimos su información

Compartimos información sobre usted de la siguiente manera:

* Con otras empresas o personas, como prestadores de servicios, contratistas o socios comerciales, que nos prestan servicios y respaldan nuestro negocio. También compartimos información con agencias de cobro para los pagos atrasados de nuestros desarrolladores.
    
* Si creemos de buena fe que la divulgación es adecuada para cumplir la legislación, la normativa o el proceso legal aplicables (como una orden o citación judicial). Esto incluye divulgar información a pedido de las fuerzas de orden público u otras autoridades gubernamentales.
    
* Si consideramos que sus acciones incumplen nuestros acuerdos o políticas, o para proteger los derechos, la privacidad, la seguridad o la propiedad de Plaid u otros.
    
* En el caso de un cambio de titularidad o control de la totalidad o parte de nuestra empresa (como una fusión, adquisición, reestructuración o quiebra).
    
* Entre Plaid y nuestras matrices, filiales, subsidiarias y otras empresas presentes y futuras que se encuentren bajo un control o titularidad común.
    
* Con su consentimiento o según sus indicaciones.
    

También recabamos, usamos y compartimos información agregada o anónima de modo que no se pueda utilizar para identificarlo o para cualquier finalidad que permita la ley aplicable.

Podemos compartir Datos Personales con terceros o permitirles recopilar Datos Personales de nuestros sitios o Servicios, como se ha descrito anteriormente.

Deze Privacyverklaring is niet van toepassing op gegevens die we verzamelen over eindgebruikers wanneer ze hun financiële rekeningen via Plaid koppelen aan een app of op de gegevens die worden gebruikt om een Plaid CRA-consumentenrapport te maken.

#### Hoe wij omgaan met gegevens

##### Gegevens die we verzamelen en categorieën bronnen

**Gegevens die u aan ons verstrekt**. We verzamelen de gegevens die u rechtstreeks aan Plaid verstrekt. U verstrekt bijvoorbeeld persoonsgegevens wanneer u een ontwikkelaarsaccount aanmaakt, ons ‘contactformulier’ invult, zich aanmeldt voor onze e-mails, klantenondersteuning aanvraagt, zich inschrijft voor facturering, of anderszins met ons communiceert. De soorten gegevens die we verzamelen zijn onder andere:

* identificatiegegevens (zoals volledige naam, e-mailadres, postadres, telefoonnummer en geboortedatum),
    
* gevoelige gegevens (zoals een rijbewijsnummer en fiscaal identificatienummer, financiële rekeninginformatie en burgerservicenummers, waar nodig om diensten te verlenen),
    
* beroepsgegevens (zoals een bedrijfsnaam en -titel), en
    
* alle andere persoonsgegevens die u verstrekt (waaronder bijvoorbeeld in ondersteuningsberichten voor ontwikkelaars).
    

We kunnen ook bepaalde documentatie verzamelen die uw foto bevat of we kunnen van u eisen dat u uw identiteit verifieert door een foto of video van uzelf te verstrekken. Gegevens die in dit verband worden verzameld, kunnen in sommige staten of landen als biometrische gegevens worden beschouwd, zoals hieronder vermeld. Zie hieronder de speciale kennisgeving voor inwoners van Illinois en Texas.

Speciale biometrische gegevensverklaring voor inwoners van Illinois en Texas

Voor inwoners van Illinois of Texas, als we vereisen dat u ons een document verstrekt met uw foto of als u uw identiteit moet verifiëren door een foto of video van uzelf te verstrekken, kunnen de gegevens die zijn afgeleid van uw gezicht die wij en onze dienstverleners namens ons verzamelen en verwerken, op sommige plaatsen worden beschouwd als biometrische gegevens. Uw gegevens worden niet langer dan drie jaar bewaard, tenzij wettelijk vereist.

**Gegevens die we ontvangen wanneer u onze technologie test**. Soms gebruiken mensen die toepassingen bouwen met behulp van onze diensten hun eigen inloggegevens voor hun bankrekening of andere financiële rekening om te testen en te evalueren hoe onze technologie in hun toepassing zal verschijnen en functioneren. Als u dit doet, moet u ons [Privacybeleid voor eindgebruikers](#privacybeleid-voor-eindgebruikers) lezen voor details over hoe we die gegevens verzamelen en verwerken.

**Gegevens die we verzamelen wanneer u gebruikmaakt van onze diensten**. Wanneer u gebruikmaakt van onze diensten, verzamelen we de volgende gegevens over u:

* **Loggegevens**: We verzamelen logbestanden wanneer u onze diensten gebruikt. Dit omvat identificatoren en elektronische informatie over netwerkactiviteiten, zoals het type browser dat u gebruikt, wanneer u onze diensten opent, de bekeken pagina’s en uw IP-adres.
    
* **Geschatte locatie**: We bepalen bij benadering de locatie van het apparaat dat u gebruikt om toegang te krijgen tot onze diensten vanaf uw IP-adres of tijdzone-instelling op uw apparaat.
    
* **Gegevens verzameld door cookies en andere trackingtechnologieën**: We gebruiken verschillende technologieën zoals cookies en webbakens in onze diensten om persoonsgegevens te verzamelen. Cookies zijn kleine gegevensbestanden die door uw webbrowser, op uw harde schijf of in het geheugen van uw apparaat worden opgeslagen en die ons helpen onze Diensten en uw ervaring te verbeteren, het gebruik van onze Diensten te bepalen en potentieel schadelijk gedrag te controleren en te detecteren. Webbakens zijn elektronische afbeeldingen die worden gebruikt in onze Diensten of e-mails en helpen bij het leveren van cookies. Webbakens tellen hoe vaak een webpagina wordt bezocht en helpen ons te begrijpen hoe onze Dienst wordt gebruikt en helpen ons onze Dienst te verbeteren.
    
    * Houd er rekening mee dat we cookies van derden kunnen gebruiken voor onze advertentiedoeleinden, zoals toegestaan door de wet en zoals verder beschreven in ons [Cookiebeleid](#cookiebeleid). Om uw cookie-instellingen en -voorkeuren te wijzigen, inclusief die voor targeting- en advertentiecookies, klikt u op de link Cookievoorkeuren in de voettekst van de pagina.
        

**Gegevens die we verzamelen uit andere bronnen**. Wij verzamelen ook gegevens over u uit andere bronnen. We kunnen bijvoorbeeld gegevens verzamelen van andere leden van uw bedrijf en van leveranciers die ons helpen nieuwe zakelijke klanten te identificeren, waaronder uw naam, e-mailadres en URL van uw sociale media-profiel.

##### Hoe we uw gegevens gebruiken

We gebruiken de gegevens die we verzamelen voor de volgende zakelijke en commerciële doeleinden:

* voor het exploiteren, verbeteren en ontwikkelen van onze diensten;
    
* Om uw identiteit te verifiëren;
    
* Om ontwikkelaars te factureren voor onze diensten en hen te betalen;
    
* Om te voldoen aan de wet, zoals het doen van belastingaangiftes;
    
* Om u zaken te sturen zoals technische kennisgevingen, updates, beveiligingswaarschuwingen en berichten over uw account;
    
* Om te reageren op uw opmerkingen, vragen en verzoeken om klantenservice;
    
* Om uw ervaring met onze diensten persoonlijker te maken;
    
* Om met u te communiceren over producten, diensten, aanbiedingen en Plaid-evenementen die wij aanbieden of sponsoren;
    
* Om trends, gebruik en activiteiten in verband met onze diensten te monitoren en te analyseren;
    
* Om fraude, kwaadaardige activiteiten en andere illegale activiteiten op te sporen en te voorkomen;
    
* Om de rechten, privacy, veiligheid of eigendom van Plaid en anderen te beschermen; en
    
* Voor andere doeleinden waarover we u informeren vóór of op het moment dat we de gegevens verzamelen.
    

##### Onze wettelijke grondslagen voor verwerking in de EER en het VK

Plaid verwerkt uw persoonsgegevens alleen wanneer we een geldige rechtsgrond hebben om dit te doen. Onze rechtsgrond voor het verwerken van de gegevens die we verzamelen, hangt af van het soort gegevens dat we hebben verzameld en de context voor het verwerken ervan. Over het algemeen verzamelen en verwerken we alleen gegevens wanneer:

* we moeten voldoen aan onze verantwoordelijkheden en verplichtingen in een contract of overeenkomst met u;
    
* om te voldoen aan onze wettelijke verplichtingen volgens toepasselijk recht;
    
* indien de verwerking noodzakelijk is in verband met onze gerechtvaardigde belangen, en uw gegevensbeschermingsrechten of fundamentele rechten en vrijheden niet zwaarder wegen dan die belangen (bijvoorbeeld om onze diensten te kunnen verlenen of actualiseren); en
    
* u hiervoor uw toestemming hebt gegeven.
    

##### Hoe we uw gegevens delen

We delen gegevens over u als volgt:

* Met andere bedrijven of personen zoals dienstverleners, aannemers of zakenpartners om diensten voor ons te verlenen en ons bedrijf te helpen ondersteunen. We delen ook gegevens met incassobureaus in het geval van achterstallige betalingen van onze ontwikkelaars.
    
* Als we te goeder trouw geloven dat openbaarmaking gepast is om te voldoen aan de toepasselijke wet- en regelgeving of juridische procedures (zoals een gerechtelijk bevel of dagvaarding). Dit omvat openbaarmaking in verband met verzoeken van wetshandhavingsinstanties of andere overheidsinstanties;
    
* Als wij van mening zijn dat uw handelingen niet in overeenstemming zijn met onze overeenkomsten of beleidslijnen, of om de rechten, privacy, veiligheid of eigendom van Plaid of anderen te beschermen;
    
* In het geval van een verandering in eigendom of controle van ons hele bedrijf of een deel daarvan (zoals een fusie, overname, reorganisatie of faillissement);
    
* Tussen Plaid en onze huidige en toekomstige moedermaatschappijen, gelieerde ondernemingen, dochterondernemingen en andere bedrijven onder gezamenlijke controle of eigendom; en
    
* Met uw toestemming of op uw aanwijzing.
    

We verzamelen, gebruiken en delen ook gegevens die zijn geaggregeerd en geanonimiseerd op een manier die niet kan worden gebruikt om u te identificeren, voor enig doel dat is toegestaan onder de toepasselijke wetgeving.

We delen mogelijk persoonsgegevens met derden of staan hen toe persoonsgegevens te verzamelen van onze sites of diensten, zoals hierboven beschreven.

In deze tabel wordt uitgelegd hoe we in de afgelopen 12 maanden persoonsgegevens hebben verzameld en gedeeld:

#### Overige details

##### Chatbots, advertenties, analyse- en andere diensten geleverd door derden

We staan derden, waaronder Google Analytics, toe om analysediensten en advertenties op onze websites te leveren. Deze derden gebruiken cookies, webbakens en andere technologieën om gegevens over u te verzamelen. Plaid gebruikt chatbots die worden aangedreven door externe dienstverleners. Houd er rekening mee dat als u persoonsgegevens aan onze chatbot verstrekt, uw gegevens kunnen worden gedeeld met de externe dienstverlener om de chatbot te ondersteunen.

Meer informatie over hoe we cookies gebruiken en uw gerelateerde keuzes vindt u in ons [Cookiebeleid](#cookiebeleid).

##### Internationale gegevensoverdrachten

We kunnen de gegevens die we over u verzamelen, overdragen naar andere landen dan het land waarin u woont voor verwerking en opslag. Als we gegevens overdragen naar een land of gebied dat niet wordt geacht privacy- en gegevensbeschermingswetten te hebben die gelijk zijn aan die van uw land, zullen we dergelijke gegevens overdragen in overeenstemming met de toepasselijke gegevensbeschermingswetten. In het bijzonder kunnen we gebruikmaken van door de Europese Commissie goedgekeurde of door de Britse Secretary of State goedgekeurde (indien van toepassing) standaardcontractbepalingen, indien nodig in combinatie met aanvullende waarborgen. U kunt om een kopie van deze standaardcontractbepalingen vragen door contact op te nemen zoals hieronder uiteengezet.

##### Bewaren van gegevens

We bewaren uw persoonsgegevens niet langer dan nodig is om de doeleinden te bereiken waarvoor ze zijn verzameld, tenzij een langere bewaartermijn is vereist onder de toepasselijke wetgeving.

##### Uw keuzes

* **Accountinformatie ontwikkelaar**. U kunt gegevens die u ons verstrekt als onderdeel van uw online ontwikkelaarsaccount, bijwerken door in te loggen op uw account of door contact met ons op te nemen.
    
* **Cookies**. Meer informatie over hoe we cookies gebruiken en uw gerelateerde keuzes vindt u in ons [Cookiebeleid](#cookiebeleid).
    
* **Marketingcommunicatie**. U kunt zich afmelden voor het ontvangen van marketinge-mails van Plaid door de aanwijzingen in dergelijke e-mails te volgen. Als u zich afmeldt, kunnen we u nog steeds andere soorten e-mails sturen, zoals ondersteuning, service en andere e-mails over uw account of onze lopende zakelijke relatie.
    

##### Uw gegevensbeschermingsrechten

U kunt rechten hebben met betrekking tot uw persoonsgegevens, waaronder het recht om te weten hoe we uw gegevens verzamelen, gebruiken of delen. Daarnaast hebt u mogelijk het recht om toegang te vragen tot uw persoonsgegevens, en om te vragen die gegevens bij te werken, te verwijderen of te corrigeren. Wij zullen uw verzoek om deze rechten uit te oefenen honoreren, ongeacht uw locatie. U wordt niet gediscrimineerd vanwege het uitoefenen van deze rechten.

In bepaalde regio’s, waaronder de EER en het VK, hebt u mogelijk aanvullende rechten tot uw beschikking. Deze rechten omvatten het recht om: bezwaar te maken tegen verwerking van uw persoonsgegevens of te verzoeken om die verwerking te beperken; uw toestemming op elk moment in te trekken wanneer onze verwerking is gebaseerd op uw toestemming; en een klacht in te dienen bij uw lokale toezichthoudende autoriteit (als u zich in de EER bevindt, zie [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_nl](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_nl) en als u zich in het Verenigd Koninkrijk bevindt, zie [www.ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/) voor contactgegevens).

Voor zowel Plaid Financial Ltd. als Plaid, B.V. hebben wij een functionaris voor gegevensbescherming (DPO) aangesteld, die ook verantwoordelijk is voor het toezicht op vragen met betrekking tot dit Beleid en waarmee contact kan worden opgenomen via e-mail op [privacy@plaid.com](mailto:privacy@plaid.com).

Als u een inwoner van Californië bent, kunnen, behoudens beperkingen en uitzonderingen die door de wet worden bepaald, sommige aanvullende rechten voor u beschikbaar zijn onder de California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) en zoals gewijzigd door de California Privacy Rights Act. U kunt ook: verzoeken om toegang tot de categorieën en specifieke onderdelen van persoonsgegevens die in de afgelopen twaalf maanden over u zijn verzameld (inclusief persoonsgegevens die voor zakelijke doeleinden openbaar zijn gemaakt); in kennis gesteld worden of uw persoonsgegevens zijn "verkocht" of "gedeeld" en aan wie; u afmelden voor "verkopen" of "delen" van uw persoonsgegevens als een bedrijf betrokken is bij het "verkopen" of "delen" van uw gegevens; en verzoeken om correctie door een bedrijf van onnauwkeurige persoonsgegevens. Houd er rekening mee dat we uw persoonsgegevens weliswaar niet verkopen, maar deze mogelijk delen met derden voor reclamedoeleinden met behulp van "cookies" zoals beschreven in ons cookiebeleid.

Zoals hierboven onder "Uw keuzes" is uiteengezet, kunt u, als u een van onze ontwikkelaars bent, uw onlineaccountgegevens inzien door in te loggen op uw account. Om uw gegevensbeschermingsrechten, indien van toepassing, anderszins uit te oefenen, kunt u contact met ons opnemen zoals beschreven in het onderstaande gedeelte “Contact opnemen met Plaid”. Mogelijk moet u aanvullende informatie verstrekken om uw identiteit te bevestigen voordat we op uw verzoek kunnen reageren.

Als we uw verzoek ontvangen van een bevoegde agent, kunnen we om bewijs vragen dat u de agent geldige schriftelijke bevoegdheid hebt gegeven om namens u verzoeken in te dienen. Als u een bevoegde agent bent die een verzoek wil indienen, neem dan contact met ons op zoals beschreven in het gedeelte “Contact opnemen met Plaid” hieronder.

We kunnen deze Privacyverklaring periodiek bijwerken of wijzigen. Als we updates of wijzigingen aanbrengen, wijzigen we de ingangsdatum bovenaan deze Verklaring. We kunnen u ook op andere manieren op de hoogte stellen van eventuele wijzigingen, zoals het plaatsen van een kennisgeving op onze homepage op [https://plaid.com](https://plaid.com/) of het sturen van een e-mail.

##### What Are Cookies

Cookies are small data files stored on your browser or device, which can be in the form of session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) or persistent cookies (which stay on your browser for a set period of time or until you delete them). They generally contain information such as website preferences, user settings, and browsing history. This information helps us recognize you as you interact with or revisit our Services.

Cookies may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by other companies (“third-party cookies”). For example, we use first-party cookies to remember your settings and preferences, such as language and location. We also integrate third-party analytics cookies, like Google Analytics, onto our websites to help us understand how you are using our websites so that we can improve them.

We also use other technologies that function similarly to cookies. For instance, we use web beacons (also called pixels), which are small images on a web page or in an email. Web beacons collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies. In addition, we use local storage, which allows data to be stored locally on your browser or device.

##### How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for a number of reasons, like helping us determine the popularity of certain content, improving our Services and your experience, and to better understand your online activity. The cookies we use generally fall into one or more of the following categories:

| Category of Cookies | How We Use These Cookies |
| --- | --- |
| Strictly Necessary | These cookies are strictly necessary for our Services to function properly. Some of our Services depend on these cookies and may not work properly, or at all, if they are disabled. |
| Functional | These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. |
| Performance | We use these cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services so that we can improve them.  <br>  <br>For example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with certain content or features. We can also use these cookies to learn more about which features are the most popular with our users and where we may need to make improvements. |
| Targeting / Advertising | We and our trusted advertising partners use these cookies to display advertisements, to make advertisements more relevant to visitors to our websites, and to track the efficiency of any advertising campaigns, both on our Services and on other websites. |

##### Your Choices

You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, since cookies can be an important part of how our Services work, if you remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.

Below are some options to control or limit how cookies are used on our Services:

* You can usually manage settings to remove or reject browser cookies manually within your browser’s configuration settings. To manage these settings, please follow the instructions given by your browser.
    
* To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install [Google’s opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
    
* For information on how our advertising partners may allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit [http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/). In addition, European users should visit [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) and Canadian users should visit [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/) to learn more about how to opt out of receiving these types of ads.
    

##### Changes to This Policy

We may update or change the cookies (or similar technologies) we use from time to time. The most up-to-date version of this Policy will be posted on our website at [https://plaid.com/legal](https://plaid.com/legal), and if we make any changes, we will update the effective date at the top of the Policy.

##### Was sind Cookies?

Cookies sind kleine Datendateien, die in Ihrem Browser oder auf Ihrem Gerät gespeichert werden. Sie können in Form von Session-Cookies (die ablaufen, sobald Sie Ihren Webbrowser schließen) oder als permanente Cookies (die für einen bestimmten Zeitraum oder bis zu ihrer Löschung in Ihrem Browser gespeichert bleiben) vorliegen. Sie enthalten in der Regel Informationen wie Website-Präferenzen, Benutzereinstellungen und den Browserverlauf. Anhand dieser Informationen können wir Sie erkennen, wenn Sie mit unseren Diensten in Kontakt treten oder diese erneut besuchen.

Cookies können entweder von dem Unternehmen, das die von Ihnen besuchte Website betreibt („Erstanbieter-Cookies“) oder von anderen Unternehmen („Drittanbieter-Cookies“) gesetzt werden. Wir nutzen beispielsweise Erstanbieter-Cookies, um Ihre Einstellungen und Präferenzen, wie Sprache und Standort, zu speichern. Wir binden auch Analyse-Cookies von Drittanbietern, wie z. B. Google Analytics, in unsere Websites ein, um zu erfahren, wie Sie unsere Websites nutzen, damit wir sie verbessern können.

Außerdem verwenden wir andere Technologien, die ähnlich wie Cookies funktionieren. So setzen wir beispielsweise Web-Beacons (auch Pixel genannt) ein, d. h. kleine Bilder auf einer Webseite oder in einer E-Mail. Web Beacons erfassen Informationen über Ihren Browser oder Ihr Gerät und können Cookies setzen. Darüber hinaus benutzen wir die lokale Speicherung, mit der Daten lokal auf Ihrem Browser oder Gerät gespeichert werden können.

##### Wie wir Cookies verwenden

Die Verwendung von Cookies erfolgt aus verschiedenen Gründen, z. B. um die Beliebtheit bestimmter Inhalte zu ermitteln, um unsere Dienste und Ihr Erlebnis zu verbessern und um Ihre Online-Aktivitäten besser zu verstehen.

Wir können mithilfe dieser Cookies auch mehr darüber erfahren, welche Funktionen bei unseren Nutzern am beliebtesten sind und wo wir eventuell Verbesserungen vornehmen müssen. |
| Targeting/Werbung | Wir und unsere zuverlässigen Werbepartner verwenden diese Cookies, um Werbung anzuzeigen, um die Werbung für die Besucher unserer Websites relevanter zu gestalten und um die Effektivität von jeglichen Werbeaktionen sowohl auf unseren Diensten als auch auf anderen Websites zu verfolgen. |

##### Ihre Wahlmöglichkeiten

Sie können selbst entscheiden, ob Sie Cookies akzeptieren möchten oder nicht. Da Cookies jedoch ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Funktionsweise unserer Dienste sein können, kann das Löschen oder Ablehnen von Cookies die Verfügbarkeit und Funktionalität unserer Dienste einschränken.

Nachstehend finden Sie einige Optionen, mit denen Sie die Verwendung von Cookies in unseren Diensten kontrollieren oder einschränken können:

* Normalerweise können Sie in den Konfigurationseinstellungen Ihres Browsers die Einstellungen zum Entfernen oder Ablehnen von Browser-Cookies manuell festlegen. Um diese Einstellungen zu ändern, müssen Sie die Anweisungen Ihres Browsers befolgen.

##### Que sont les cookies ?

Les cookies sont de petits fichiers de données stockés sur votre navigateur ou votre appareil, qui peuvent prendre la forme de cookies de session (qui expirent lorsque vous fermez votre navigateur Internet) ou de cookies persistants (qui restent sur votre navigateur pendant une période définie ou jusqu’à ce que vous les supprimiez). Ils contiennent généralement des informations telles que les préférences du site Web, les paramètres utilisateur et l’historique de navigation. Ces informations nous aident à vous reconnaître lorsque vous interagissez avec nos Services ou lorsque vous les consultez à nouveau.

Les cookies peuvent être transmis par l’entité qui exploite le site Web que vous visitez (« cookies interne ») ou par d’autres sociétés (« cookies tiers »).

Nous intégrons également des cookies analytiques tiers, comme Google Analytics, sur nos sites Web pour nous aider à comprendre comment vous les utilisez, afin de les améliorer.

Nous utilisons également d’autres technologies qui fonctionnent de la même manière que les cookies. Par exemple, nous utilisons des balises Internet (également appelées pixels), qui sont de petites images sur une page Internet ou dans un e-mail. Les balises Internet collectent des informations sur votre navigateur ou votre appareil, et peuvent définir des cookies. En outre, nous utilisons un stockage local, qui permet de stocker les données localement sur votre navigateur ou votre appareil.

##### Wat zijn cookies?

Cookies zijn kleine gegevensbestanden die op uw browser of apparaat worden opgeslagen in de vorm van sessiecookies (die verlopen zodra u uw webbrowser sluit) of permanente cookies (die gedurende een bepaalde periode op uw browser blijven staan of totdat u ze verwijdert). Ze bevatten over het algemeen informatie zoals websitevoorkeuren, gebruikersinstellingen en browsegeschiedenis. Deze informatie helpt ons u te herkennen wanneer u onze Diensten gebruikt of opnieuw bezoekt.

Cookies kunnen worden aangeboden door de entiteit die de website beheert die u bezoekt (‘eerstepartijcookies’) of door andere bedrijven (‘cookies van derden’).

Ook integreren we analytische cookies van derden op onze websites, zoals Google Analytics, om ons te helpen begrijpen hoe u onze websites gebruikt, met als doel deze te verbeteren.

Daarnaast gebruiken we ook andere technologieën die op dezelfde manier werken als cookies. Zo maken we bijvoorbeeld gebruik van webbakens (ook wel pixels genoemd), wat kleine afbeeldingen op een webpagina of in een e-mail zijn. Webbakens verzamelen informatie over uw browser of apparaat en kunnen cookies instellen. Bovendien maken we gebruik van lokale opslag, waardoor gegevens lokaal op uw browser of apparaat kunnen worden opgeslagen.

#### Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement

##### Introduction

At Plaid, we are committed to a set of core principles: Impact; Grow together; Embrace openness and positivity; Think rigorously, act with urgency; Make it better; Consumer outcomes via customer love; and Invent tomorrow. In accordance with our core principles, Plaid is committed to ensuring there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our businesses and supply chains.

In compliance with its obligation under s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the **"2015 Act"**), this statement sets out the steps Plaid Inc. has taken in the last financial year to ensure modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any parts of its business or in any of its supply chains. This statement covers the steps taken by Plaid Inc. and all of its group subsidiaries, including Plaid Financial Ltd. and Plaid, B.V. (collectively, **"Plaid"** and **“our”**). Although covered by this statement, we note that Plaid Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Plaid Financial Ltd., does not have an obligation itself to make a transparency in supply statement pursuant to s.54 of the 2015 Act.

##### Our business

Plaid provides technical infrastructure application programming interfaces (**"APIs"**) to companies that develop digital financial applications (**"apps"**) and services to enable consumers and businesses (together, **“end users”**) to share data from their financial accounts with the apps and services. These apps and services help end users do things like save for retirement, manage their spending, streamline loan applications, or transfer money.

Plaid is a leading provider in the UK, Europe and North America, connecting over 4,500 apps and services to more than 11,000 financial institutions.

Plaid is headquartered in San Francisco, California and has over 600 team members across 6 offices in the US, Europe and the UK.

In the UK, Plaid is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (Firm Reference Number: 804718) for the provision of payment services.

##### Our supply chains

As a technology company, Plaid's substantive supply chains are relatively short, and mostly comprised of organisations Plaid uses on an on-going basis for services such as Software as a Service (**"SaaS"**) or client installable software. In accordance with our Vendor Management Policy introduced in 28 May 2019 and most recently updated 26 June 2020, during last financial year, we have continued to undertake an on-boarding review of new vendors as well as ongoing monitoring of critical vendors to ensure they are complying with their contractual commitments and not otherwise breaching applicable law. Plaid’s relationship with a vendor may be adjusted or terminated in the event that the monitoring reveals deficiencies or material risks that are unacceptable to Plaid. This would include any identified risk of modern slavery or human trafficking. We have not identified any potential modern slavery or human trafficking issues to date in our supply chains.

##### Our policies and contractual controls

Plaid strictly complies with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal policies and procedures, including our Code of Business Conduct (**"the Code"**), to ensure we act professionally, transparently and with integrity at all times.

The Code exists to help make clear what we expect of our team members, and to make sure that Plaid continues to be a company that others want to do business with and that our team members are proud to be part of. All team members, as well as those doing business with Plaid, must abide by and follow this Code, which covers the laws we must obey and offers guidance for navigating the complexities of doing business on a global scale.

In relation to human trafficking the Code states "The United States Government has a zero-tolerance policy regarding trafficking in persons. It goes without saying that Plaid strictly prohibits team members from soliciting or engaging in: (a) prostitution, (b) trafficking in persons, and (c) forced labor. Plaid will take appropriate disciplinary action — including, but not limited to, termination — against anyone who violates this prohibition. Team members are also under an affirmative obligation to timely report any information received from any source potentially constituting a violation of this policy."

Plaid staff are required to read and sign an 'Acknowledgement of Receipt and Review' to confirm they received a copy of the Code and understand and will act in accordance with the rules, policies and procedures in the Code. The Code has continued to apply during the last financial year. It is reviewed and updated (as needed) on an annual basis and was last reviewed and updated on 8 June 2020. Compliance with the Code should, amongst other things, help reduce the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in the Plaid business and its supply chains.

##### Risk assessment and due diligence

Plaid is not aware of any slavery or human trafficking issues within its group businesses or supply chains. In the last financial year, no potential issues of this type have been identified or reported through internal reporting channels (such as Plaid's procedures for reporting suspected violations, illegal or unethical behavior outlined in the Code), audit processes, other whistleblowing channels or otherwise. Plaid Inc. has not received any information from any of the entities in the Plaid group indicating that there may be any such issues with any of its intra-group suppliers or their supply chains.

Reflecting upon the position as set out above, we consider the risk of slavery or human trafficking in Plaid, and its supply chain continues to be low. However, should any potential issue be identified, Plaid will act swiftly to investigate and, where necessary, act to ensure there is no modern slavery or human trafficking occurring in its business or supply chains.

##### Next steps

Plaid is committed to continuing to prevent slavery or human trafficking in its business and supply chain.

##### Approval of this statement

This statement is made in compliance with Plaid Inc.'s obligations under s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the financial year ending December 31, 2020. This statement was approved by Plaid Inc. on 30 April 2021.
