Prey's Privacy Policy
=====================

At, PREY your security and privacy are our priority. We use a design based on data minimization and will only ask the most basic information for your account creation. We are transparent in the gathering and processing of your personal data. Consequently, we have decided to adhere the highest standard of privacy by complying with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and making those rights available to all of our users so you can know that both your devices and your data are safe with us.

We will NEVER request unnecessary information unless it is necessary to provide a better service.

We will NEVER sell your personal information or data from your devices to a third party.

We will NEVER enable the functionalities of our software without your prior consent or request. By adding a device to your account, location tracking is set to ON by default. You can change this at any time on your settings.

We will NEVER access your personal information or data from your devices without your prior consent and will do so solely for support purposes.

If you have any concerns about how we protect and process your data, please do not hesitate to contact us at privacy at preyhq dot com.

The information we collect
--------------------------

We only request the minimum amount of data to create your account, this includes your name and country; however, it is important to highlight that the only way for us to identify you as a user is through the e-mail you used to register, which will be the official channel of communication between us. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the basis for us processing personal data is the provision of a service.

Once the software is installed on your device the default settings for location awareness is “on”, this mean that your devices will send all location changes to our servers. You can set this option to “off” in which case we won’t ever get the location information of your devices unless they are set to missing or you specifically request it. Once a device is set to “missing” you can start receiving reports and have the camera take pictures, this option can be turned off in the report settings. A device marked as ‘missing’ sends technical identification data to our servers along with the geo-localization, images and files you decide to retrieve from it.

### Support forum

You can use our Support Forum free of charge; all your questions and suggestions are welcome. To access this Forum, you need to sign-in with a User Name and e-mail for validation and contact purposes. You are responsible for the information you voluntarily decide to include in your profile, you keep full control over it and can delete it whenever you like. The only exception to this rule applies to the content of your posts, which remains for registration and coherence and is never deleted. However, if you want your user name to be removed from your posts, you can contact us at privacy at preyhq dot com.

#### Purpose of our Data collection

We collect your name, mail and country when you create an account for the purpose of user identification. This collection is based on the fulfillment of a service so that we can provide both support and help with your account or password recovery. We'll store this information for as long the account exists, you can delete it by deleting your account.

When you add a device by installing our software we'll start collecting your location by default and can collect some files if you use the file retrieval function. This collection is based on the fulfillment of a service and its only purpose is to help you safely recover or track your devices and its content. We do not share nor sell this information to third parties. We'll store this information for as long the account exists, you can delete it by deleting your account.

If you exercise a data right such as data deletion or portability we'll collect and store such requests based on a legitimate interest so that we can probe our compliance.

We can collect your location, demographic data, ip address, hardware and software information, user interaction with our website and/or panel if you agree to use cookies on our website and as such is based on consent. The purpose of this collection is to help us better understand who and how uses Prey. You can delete this information by making a data deletion request.

#### Service providers and who the organizations we send information to

We send your login data, including your e-mail, country, region, city, time zone, number of devices, user type and account id. Cookies are used to obtain this information, which require your prior consent and it is intended solely for our exclusive use. This is done for the purpose of maintaining the quality of our service.

We use [Crashlytics](https://try.crashlytics.com/) and [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) to obtain an anonymized record of the errors and bugs of our software. None of these transfers contain Personally Identifiable Information and are done for the purpose of debugging.

We use [Facebook’s Pixel](https://web.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel?_rdc=1&_rdr) to obtain information about visits to our website and track our ads. Cookies are used to obtain this information, which require your prior consent. Facebook fully complies with the GDPR. With regards to the CPPA, the business purpose of this collection is auditing.

We use [Pipedrive,](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/privacy) Outreach and [Active Campaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/gdpr-updates/) as platforms to administer the commercial information of our clients.

In addition, we use them as a cookie, but as all of the cookies we use, they require your express consent to send to us anonymous demographic data, hardware/software information, localization, interaction with the website and your IP address. All of the above have a Data Privacy Framework Program ensuring the protection of our user’s personal data in accordance with this policy. These transfers are done on our behalf to process and fulfill orders and transactions.

We use [Helpscout](https://www.helpscout.net/) as a customer service platform. We do not send more information other than that provided in the support tickets, which is intended only for our exclusive use. This treatment is done on our exclusive behalf to provide customer service.

We use [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) and Chargebee to manage payment for our PRO services. Your payment information is sent encrypted and secured under the strictest market standards. They both have GDPR and PCI-DSS compliance.

We use [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) to store data from our users and servers. Both companies are fully compliant with the GDPR and the CCPA and follow the strictest standards of security and scrutiny.

If you use the option to access our services through Facebook, Twitter or other social network or login service provided by third-parties, you are subject to their own data privacy and processing policies. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and UK individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Prey is potentially liable.

#### File retrieval and Privacy

Under no circumstance, our file retrieval functionality constitutes a back-up or administration system in the Cloud. We do not check nor do we have access to the files you retrieve, and we will never check their content. If you use the retrieval functionality, the files will be hosted in Google Cloud Storage and we do not have access to that information. Your files will be available during thirty (30) days from the retrieval request.

#### Authorized use and multi-user accounts

Prey is a security application aimed at facilitating the search for and access to lost devices of our users. The purpose of Prey-Anti-Theft is not to register or track people down, and according to our terms and conditions, you agree to such limitations. Likewise, you may only install Prey in devices you are legally authorized to do so.  

In the case of our multi-user accounts, you should be aware that all administrators may enable your devices as lost. At any time, you can know who the administrators of your account are by checking your account’s information in the application’s panel. If you have any problems with this functionality or you would like access to administrators to be removed contact us at privacy at preyhq dot com.

#### Data rights and requests

At Prey, we respect your ownership over your personal data; therefore, you can exercise your right to access, modify and remove it easily from the Panel. If you wish to cancel the processing of your personal data, you only have to uncheck your devices as lost because Prey does not make passive tracking of your devices, unless you expressly require it. If you decide to remove the personal data associated with your Prey account, you can do so in the Panel. If you wish to request the removal of all your personal data, you can request a full data deletion by sending an email to privacy at preyhq dot com. Such requests can only be made once every five (5) months.

If you decide to close an account, we delete all your data. Nevertheless, we keep a record of payment history, data deletion and portability requests as a backup for legal reasons. The lawfulness of these backups is based on the compliance of a legal obligation.

#### Google API Limited Use Disclosure

Prey's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
