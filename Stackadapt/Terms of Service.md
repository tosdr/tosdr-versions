The parties are independent contractors and no other relationship is intended. Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute either party as an agent, representative or employee of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. Neither party shall act in a manner that expresses or implies a relationship other than that of independent contractor. Each party shall act solely as an independent contractor and shall not be responsible for the acts or omissions of the other party. Neither party will have the authority or right to represent nor obligate the other party in any way except as expressly authorized by the Agreement.

### 12.8 Governing Law

The Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws in force in the Province of Ontario. The parties hereto agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario.

### 12.9 Waiver

The waiver by either party of a breach or default of any provision of the Agreement by the other party shall not be effective unless in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or of any other provision. Nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right, power or privilege by such party shall constitute a waiver.

### 12.10 Assignment

Company may not assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without StackAdapt’s prior written consent, and any such purported assignment shall be void.

### 12.11 Remedies

Company acknowledges that its breach of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provision of the Agreement may cause StackAdapt irreparable damage, which monetary damages would be inadequate to remedy. Consequently, StackAdapt may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the Agreement and prevent any and all acts in violation of those provisions. The exercise by either party of any remedy under the Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Agreement or otherwise.

### 12.12 Survival

Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement.
