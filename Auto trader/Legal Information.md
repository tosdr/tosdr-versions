    **Vehicle Registration Numbers (VRM)** are required to place an advert on the Website for regulatory and security purposes.

We will share your information with the dealer either via our Dealer Portal or via our interface into the dealer’s platform (which may be the dealer’s own platform or a third party platform). Once we share your information (including, if applicable, your finance application) with the dealer, the dealer will act as a controller in its own right in respect of your personal data. Therefore, you must read the dealer’s privacy notice and satisfy yourself as to the purposes for which the dealer will use your personal data. The dealer is solely responsible for ensuring that its use and processing of your personal data (either in our Dealer Portal or the dealer’s platform, as applicable) is in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation, including that the personal data is only kept for as long as necessary and in accordance with the dealer’s retention periods. Please speak to the dealer for further information.
    
    **Finance Application Service - If you use this service on the Website or App (including as part of an online order) please note the following:**
    
    **Assessing Suitability for Finance and Completing a Soft Search**
    
    In order for us to assess your suitability for finance and to provide you with a personalised quote, we initially use your personal data to complete a soft search which involves checking the information you provide against one or both of the credit reference agencies referred to below and against the lender and/or broker criteria held by Auto Trader and/or its service providers. The information you provide may include the following information about you (and any joint applicants):
    
    * personal details (for example, **name, date of birth and marital status**);
    * contact details (for example, **address, email address and phone number**);
    * employment details (for example, **employment status, job title, income and employer’s contact details**);
    * information to verify your identity (for example, **address history and whether you have a valid driving licence and UK passport**); and
    * details of the vehicle you wish to buy (including the **vehicle registration number**).
    
    As a result of an **automated process**, which uses credit history from the credit reference agencies and filters this information against lender and/or broker lending criteria, you will be presented with the details of lenders and/or brokers who you may be able to obtain a loan from. Please note that this does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain a loan from these lenders and/or brokers.
    
    This will not have any adverse effect on your credit rating and the soft search(s) on your credit file will only be visible to you. However, you are only able to proceed to a full finance application on our Website or App with one of the lenders or brokers for whom our processes deem that you might be eligible. This may also mean that you are unable to proceed to a full finance application on our Website or App where there are no lenders or brokers whose criteria are met using the soft check process.
    
    To complete a soft search we share personal data relating to you (and, as applicable, any joint applicant) with the credit reference agencies Equifax and/or Experian (acting as controllers in their own right) and you should ensure you are happy with their privacy notices:
    
    * Equifax: [https://www.equifax.co.uk/ein.html](https://www.equifax.co.uk/ein.html)
    * Experian: [https://www.experian.co.uk/privacy/consumer-information-portal](https://www.experian.co.uk/privacy/consumer-information-portal)
    
    The credit reference agencies will run a soft search each time you view a quote saved in your account, so that you always see the most up-to-date quote.
    
    The credit reference agencies will share only necessary details from your credit file, including your credit score. They may also share information relating to any joint applicants or individuals who appear to be financially linked or associated with you (“**Financial Associate(s)**“). For example, if you have a joint mortgage with your spouse, the financial details of your spouse may be made available to us as their financial standing may directly impact your finance application. You must ensure you have the consent of any Financial Associate(s) prior to completing the form at the “soft search“ stage. You must also bring this Privacy Notice to their attention.
    
    **Enhanced personalised quote and/or eligibility score**
    
    In the case of the lender(s) or broker(s) listed below, who offer additional capability, we will share information about you (and any joint applicants) with the applicable lender(s) at this “soft search“ stage in order for the lender(s) or broker(s) (as applicable) (acting as a data controller in their own right) to make an assessment (which may include automated processing or profiling) based on their complete lending criteria in order to provide you with: (i) an enhanced personalised quote; and/or (ii) an eligibility score, which is the percentage likelihood of you being accepted for a certain finance product. There is no impact on your credit score as only a soft search will be carried out by the credit agencies (as described above). You should ensure that you are happy with the relevant lender’s or broker’s (as applicable) privacy notice.
    
    Santander: [https://www.santanderconsumer.co.uk/your-data/privacy-policy/](https://www.santanderconsumer.co.uk/your-data/privacy-policy/)
    
    **Full Finance Application**
    
    Where you proceed to a full finance application, you will need to provide some further information as requested by the relevant lender or broker (as applicable). We will share information about you and any joint applicants with the lender or broker (as relevant), and the relevant dealer who is selling the vehicle, so that they can progress your application.
    
    Note that Auto Trader acts a data controller in respect of its processing of your personal data for the purposes of providing and administrating the finance application service and for our own analysis and development of our Website and services in accordance with this Privacy Notice. The lender/broker and the dealer each act as a data controller in their own right in respect of their processing of your personal data for the purpose of progressing your application and the sale of the vehicle (as applicable). You should ensure you are happy with the lender’s/broker’s and the dealer’s privacy notice, which is available from the lender/broker and dealer (as applicable) on request.
    
    Your application for finance is determined by the lender or broker (as applicable).
    
    **Joint Finance Applications**
    
    If you are making a joint finance application, we will create a joint record for you and the other person(s) and so you must ensure you have their consent prior to disclosing their personal data. You must also bring this Privacy Notice to their attention.
    
    **Additional Information**
    
    We will use the information you provide, and that we obtain from the credit agencies and lenders/brokers, in order to present the results of any finance application via the Website or App.
    
    If you do not complete the form which enables us to complete a soft search and present quotations to you, we will send you a reminder email enabling you to complete the process
    
    We will process your data which we collect in respect of Finance Application Service in accordance with the “How long do we keep data“ section of this Privacy Notice below.

    When you submit your application, we share your personal data relating to you (and, as applicable, any joint applicant) with the credit reference agency Experian (acting as a controller in their own right) to complete a soft search and you should ensure you are happy with their privacy notice:

    When you submit your application, we/Vanarama will share your personal data with: (i) Interbacs Ltd (acting as our processor) to validate your bank details; and (ii) the lender, who will also contact credit references agencies to perform a credit check. This may be a hard credit check, which will be visible to other lenders on your credit report.
