1 - MOBY, including its Affiliated Companies, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assignees, and you agree that any Dispute (as defined herein) between you and MOBY regarding any aspect of your relationship with MOBY, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court.  Each of you and MOBY agrees to give up the right to sue in court. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and MOBY, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory.  The term “Dispute” specifically includes, but is not limited to, any and all claims between you and MOBY in any way related to or concerning this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms of Use (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), any products or services provided by MOBY, any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other.  The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement shall be as required under applicable local law, if any.  Disputes over whether any exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator.  Each of you and MOBY also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and MOBY (see paragraph 9 below). Court review of the arbitration award shall only be in accordance with the applicable law.  The appointed arbitrator(s) must be bound by the terms of this arbitration agreement.  The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages).

2 - All domestic disputes between MOBY and any other Afghan national (“Domestic Disputes”) shall be finally resolved through domestic arbitration, and all disputes of international nature between MOBY and any other non-Afghan (“International Disputes”) shall be resolved through international arbitration as outlined below. Regardless whether the dispute is a domestic or international, the substantive law shall be the laws of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  
 

**Domestic Arbitration**

Any domestic arbitration between you and MOBY shall be conducted by the Afghan Center for Dispute Resolution (“ACDR”) pursuant to the Afghan Law of Commercial Arbitration (the “Domestic Rules”). The venue of arbitration shall be Kabul, Afghanistan. The Arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator; and if you and MOBY cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator shall be appointed by ACDR pursuant to the Rules. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. The Afghan Law on Commercial Arbitration may be found at [http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/af/af027en.pdf](http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/af/af027en.pdf).

The venue for arbitration shall be Dubai, UAE. The language of arbitration shall be English. The Arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator; and if you and MOBY cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator shall be appointed by the institution pursuant to the Rules. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. The DIAC Arbitration Rules may be found at [http://www.diac.ae/idias/rules/.](http://www.diac.ae/idias/rules/.%C2%A0)   
 

3 - If either you or MOBY wants to arbitrate a claim, you or MOBY must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the website or portion of the website to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested.  Your Notice to MOBY must be sent by mail to MOBY’s head office at Street #12, Wazir Akbar Khan, Kabul, Afghanistan. MOBY will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide. It is the sender’s responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice.  During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.   
If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the provisions of these Terms of Use. In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to MOBY at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute. 

4 - You and MOBY acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration: (a) YOU AND MOBY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (b) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (c) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 below.

5 - Filing fees or other charges shall be payable in line with the procedural rules of this arbitration agreement.

6 - Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and MOBY shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the procedural rules of this arbitration agreement, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.

7 - Each of you and MOBY may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration. Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys' fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s). In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides’ arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.

8 - The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.  The arbitrator may not order MOBY to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless MOBY explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order Further, unless MOBY expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons’ claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.

9 - You and MOBY agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation,  proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.

10 - Except for subpart (a) in paragraph (4) (_i.e._, the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (4) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of these Terms, including the provisions governing where actions against MOBY must be pursued, the choice of governing law, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.

**Indemnity**

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold MOBY and its affiliates, and their respective successors and assignees, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, licensors, suppliers and service providers harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), arising in any way out of or in connection with (a) your use of this website, (b) your breach or violation of these Terms of Use; or (c) your violation of any rights of another. MOBBY reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise, and you agree to fully cooperate with us upon our request.

YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THIS WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED IN GOOD FAITH AND WITHIN ONE (1) MONTH OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF INFRINGEMENT. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED UNLESS THE APPLICABLE LAW STATES OTHERWISE.

**Miscellaneous**

These Terms of Use contain the complete and entire understanding and agreement between you and MOBY concerning this website and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings relating to the website and your use thereof. These Terms of Use cannot be changed orally. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any provision of these Terms of Use is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The failure of MOBY to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

The Section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
