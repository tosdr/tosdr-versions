**14\. International Access:**

**15\. Resolution of Disputes:**

1. **Governing Law:** The laws of the State of New Jersey shall govern these Terms of Use.
2. **Arbitration:** While we will make reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements you may have with TerraCycle, if these efforts fail you agree that all claims, disputes or controversies between you and TerraCycle arising out of these Terms of Use, or the purchase of any products or services (“Claims”) shall be exclusively submitted to binding arbitration, no matter what legal theory they are based on or what remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief) they seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law; Claims made as counterclaims, cross-claims, third- party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and Claims made independently or with other claims. In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor these Terms of Use and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief, and the parties have the right to be represented by counsel of their choice.  **In arbitration, however, (i) there is no judge or jury (ii) the proceedings and outcome are generally subject to certain confidentiality rules, (iii) the discovery process is limited, and (iv) a court’s review of the arbitrator’s ruling is extremely limited.**
    1. The party filing arbitration must submit Claims to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and pursuing arbitration. Any in-person hearing in the arbitration will be held in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to your then-current residential address, or at some other place to which you and TerraCycle agree in writing. The arbitrator shall apply New Jersey law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act. You may obtain copies of the current AAA Rules, and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration, by contacting the AAA at 800-778-7879, or by visiting the AAA’s website at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). 
    2. A single, neutral arbitrator will resolve Claims. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer with at least ten (10) years’ experience or a retired or former judge, selected in accordance with the AAA rules. The arbitration will follow the AAA’s then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”), unless those AAA Rules are inconsistent with these Terms of Use, in which case these Terms of Use govern.  The payment of all AAA and arbitrator fees and costs will be in accordance with the AAA Rules.  Subject to those AAA Rules, each party to the arbitration will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but the prevailing party in the arbitration may recover any or all costs or expenses from the other party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law and the AAA Rules, so determines. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on the parties.
    3. The foregoing notwithstanding, both parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for any dispute or claim falling within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction.
3. **_Class Action Waiver_**_:_ YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND TERRACYCLE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, “PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL” ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND. CLAIMS AND REMEDIES SOUGHT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION ARE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS. If, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to these Terms of Use holds that this class action waiver provision is unenforceable as to any Claim you have brought, then our agreement to arbitrate will not apply, and your Claim must be brought exclusively in court in New Jersey.
4. **Time Bar**: ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE CLAIM.  

**16\. Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. [Our Privacy Policy](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/pages/privacy-policy) describes how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information and explains the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information.

**Free & Paid Recycling Programs and TerraCycle Recycling Rewards Programs**

**Free & Paid Recycling Programs**

TerraCycle seeks to operate its Free (sponsored) and Paid recycling programs (“Programs”) in an ecologically friendly and rational manner. To that end, specific Free Programs may have minimum shipping requirements (a certain minimum weight must be shipped or the shipment will not be eligible for TerraCycle Recycling Rewards credit) which are specified on the sponsor’s TerraCycle website program page. Further, TerraCycle may close Free Program locations if no shipment has been received from that Program location during a six-month period. This is done to eliminate dormant locations and allow that Program “spot” to be otherwise utilized. After the closure, the location may not be able to join the Program again if the space has been filled. TerraCycle Programs are intended exclusively for used, post-consumer packaging. Post-industrial, factory off-spec, write-off, misprinted, or other pre-consumer waste is not accepted through these Program solutions. Any shipments of such post-industrial waste will be returned to the point of origin and will incur a non-compliance charge.

It shall be prohibited to use the Programs for commercial use. TerraCycle will remove from the Programs any individual or organization not complying with this obligation.

Overweight parcels (i.e. above 50 pounds per parcel) or oversized parcels (i.e. 18inx18inx18in per parcel), duplicated labels, incorrect or misused labels, parcels or waste not compliant with the Program requirements are not accepted and TerraCycle has the right to remove any individual or organisation from the Programs in any of the above events. 

Labels can only be downloaded and used by the account owner and cannot be used by any third party. TerraCycle has the right to remove from the Programs any individual or organisation not complying with this requirement.

Some TerraCycle Programs employ TerraCycle Public Drop Off points (each, a “PDO”) to more efficiently collect program-compliant materials for recycling.  Organizations that elect to operate PDOs encourage individuals to “drop off” their materials that qualify for specific Programs. By signing up to be a PDO and agreeing to these Terms of Use, PDOs are also agreeing that TerraCycle may publish on the TerraCycle websites and on pages on third-party online platforms, relevant information about the PDO to allow participants to contact and find the location and to include their PDO in an interactive map designed to help consumers find PDOs in their area. The information shared are the address and contact details that have been approved by the TerraCycle account holder. Such PDOs also agree that operating as a TerraCycle Public Drop Off point does not violate any applicable rules of their location, regulations or laws.

Only one account per person is authorized. 

**TerraCycle Recycling Rewards** 

Many Free Programs accrue TerraCycle Recycling Reward points (“Points”) for each unit of waste collected (over a minimum amount). Points may be applied in one of two ways : a) they may be applied to one of the charitable programs chosen by TerraCycle for specific actions (by way of example only, a fixed number of points may be redeemed to plant trees by the Arbor Day Foundation) by our partner organizations (see, [www.terracycle.com/redeem](http://www.terracycle.com/redeem) for descriptions of these programs); or b) the points may be redeemed for cash amounts that will be sent to the Charity or School designated by the account holder.

From the day your shipment is received, the Points will be accrued on your account within thirty (30) days, if applicable. If there are any issues with the points attribution, you will have sixty (90) days after this period to contact us to notify such issue and TerraCycle will investigate it. Past this period, TerraCycle will not consider any claim.

Points will expire, and the account holding them will be closed if there is no activity in the user’s TerraCycle account for a one-year period. Account activity includes logging into the website, downloading a shipping label, shipping a package of compliant post-consumer material to TerraCycle, or an election entered onto TerraCycle’s website to either designate Points for a specific program or redemption of Points into cash to be sent to a designated charity or school. Points that expire in this manner will not be available for designation to charities or for redemption. All checks expire one year after issue and no replacement requests for lost checks will be honored after one year of the issuance date of the original check. In addition, if correct payment details are not provided after two attempts, any outstanding redemption points will be forfeited.

In the case of a minimum weight change, a reduction in the number of points attributed or new restrictions on the size or format of parcels, each Program participant will be informed of the change by email. Any parcel sent at least fourteen days before the date of the change indicated in the email will be subject to the terms of the Program in place before the announced date

Payments to schools and nonprofit organizations are made twice per year. 

To allocate donations to schools or nonprofit organizations, you must redeem your Points on your TerraCycle account. Please note, the minimum amount of points are noted on [terracycle.com/en-US/redeem](http://terracycle.com/en-US/redeem). You can only donate to a charity in the same country as your account is registered.

Redeem your Points by April 30 and TerraCycle will endeavor to pay your nominated school or nonprofit organization in June.

Redeem your Points by October 31 and TerraCycle will endeavor to pay your nominated school or nonprofit organization in December.
