IV. Cookies

### 1\. What are cookies

We use cookies on our site. These are small files that your browser automatically creates and that are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our site. Cookies do no damage to your end device, and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malware.

The use of cookies serves on the one hand to make the use of our offer more pleasant for you. They will be deleted automatically after you leave our website.

In addition, to optimize user-friendliness, we also use temporary, so-called comfort cookies, which are stored on your terminal device for a certain specified period of time.

As a rule, these are deleted after a maximum of 30 days. Only those comfort cookies that concern language settings are saved for 365 days.

We also use cookies as part of third-party tools to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for you for the purpose of optimizing our offer (see V). These analysis and tracking cookies enable us to automatically recognize when you return to our site that you have already been with us. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined period of time.

With the help of “consentmanager”, it is thus possible to give or refuse your consent for certain functionalities of our website, e.g. for the purpose of integrating external elements, integrating streaming content, statistical analysis, reach measurement and personalized advertising. Consent can be given or rejected for all or individual functions. These settings can be adjusted again afterwards. The purpose of integrating “consentmanager” is to allow the users of our website to decide on the aforementioned matters and, in the course of further use of our website, to offer the possibility of changing settings that have already been made. In the course of using “consentmanager”, personal data as well as information of the end devices used, such as the IP address, are processed.

The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c) in conjunction with. Art. 6 para. 3 p. 1 lit. a) in conjunction with. Art. 7 para. 1 DSGVO and alternatively lit. f). By processing the data, we help our customers (according to DSGVO the responsible party) to fulfill their legal obligations (e.g. obligation to provide evidence). Our legitimate interests in the processing lie in the storage of user settings and preferences in relation to the use of cookies and other functionalities. “Consentmanager” stores your data as long as your user settings are active. Two years after the user settings have been made, you will be asked for your consent again. The user settings made will then be stored again for this period.

You can object to the processing. Your right to object exists for reasons arising from your particular situation. For the purpose of objection, please get in touch via e-mail at [**info@consentmanager.net**](mailto:info@consentmanager.net).
