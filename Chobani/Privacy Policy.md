_Non-Personal Information_  
Non-personal information refers to data and information that does not personally identify you as the individual to whom the data or information relates, which may include data that (i) is aggregated (that is, relates to a group of individuals) (“aggregated information”), or (ii) cannot reasonably identify or be linked to you (“deidentified information”).

Chobani may gather or create non-personal information in various ways and may share non-personal information publicly and with other third parties. For example, we may share non-personal information with our partners for certain advertising and measurement purposes. We may also use non-personal information to assess trends about the general use of our products and services.

We may also acquire personal information from publicly available sources, social media platforms, and vendors and other third parties that may share your personal information as permitted in their privacy policies.

_Collection Technology_  
We may use Collection Technology to collect and store personal information. “Collection Technology” refers to cookies, web beacons, pixels, gifs, tags and other technologies that may collect information. Collection Technology such as a cookie may store a piece of data on your browser or device, while other forms of Collection Technology may identify your browser or device and/or collect information through other means.

You may delete and/or refuse the use of certain Collection Technologies, including cookies, by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. You may use the Websites and Applications even if you choose to refuse or delete such Collection Technologies; however, please note that this may affect your ability to use the full functionality of the Websites and Applications and may impact our ability to customize the Websites and Applications for you.
