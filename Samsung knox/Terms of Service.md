We may use third-party analytics services on the Business Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyze your use of the Business Services and improve the Business Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Business Services, help administer the Business Services and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit [https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) and [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

**What do we do to keep your information secure?**

We have put in place reasonable physical and technical measures designed to safeguard the information we collect in connection with the Business Services.

**Where do we transfer your information?**

Your use or participation in the Business Services may involve transfer, storage and processing of your information outside of your country of residence, consistent with this policy. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. We will take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, which are designed to ensure that your personal information remains protected.

**What are your rights?**

Under the laws of some jurisdictions, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, including the right to request details about the information we collect about you, delete information collected about you, and to correct inaccuracies in that information. In compliance with applicable law, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.

If you request deletion of personal information, you may not be able to access or use the Business Services, and residual personal information may continue to reside in Samsung's records and archives for some time, but Samsung will not use that information for commercial purposes. Where permitted under applicable law, Samsung reserves the right to keep your personal information, or a relevant part of it, if Samsung has suspended, limited, or terminated your access to the Business Services for violating the Samsung Terms of Use, when necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Samsung, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, employees or customers.

To update your preferences, limit the communications you receive from us, or submit a request, please contact us as specified in the **Contact** section below.

**How long do we keep your information?**

We take reasonable steps designed to ensure that we retain information about you only for so long as is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, as described in this Privacy Policy or any other notice provided at the time of collection, taking into account statutes of limitation and records retention requirements under applicable law, as well as our records retention requirements and policies.

**Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies**

We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Business Services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Business Services.

Cookies

Cookies are small files that store information on your device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

* Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
    
* Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Business Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Business Services and provide you with a better experience.
    
* Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access the Business Service.
    
* Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Business Services and other websites and apps.
    

When you use a web browser to access the Business Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies.

Please note, however, that some Business Services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Business Services, or certain parts of them. The Business Services are not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers.

Beacons

We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Business Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
