* Maintaining your privacy despite our use of cookies, web beacons, clear GIF, tracking pixels, and similar mechanisms
    
    Equitable uses cookies, web beacons, clear GIF, tracking pixels and other mechanisms to track your usage patterns on our websites. None of these things store, record or share your personally identifiable information, and are therefore harmless when it comes to your privacy and maintaining the security and confidentiality of your personal information.
    
    ###### What is a cookie?
    
    A cookie is a small data file that a website can send to your computer’s browser when you visit a website. It is not a computer program. A cookie does not extract personally identifiable information about you, such as your name and address, from your computer. It does not read data on your hard drive or instruct your computer to perform any function. A cookie sent to your browser from our websites can only be used by our websites to recognize your computer when you log onto our websites. We also use cookies to track your usage patterns, such as how frequently you log in to a website, which pages you view, when and for how long. Tracking information we may obtain by using a cookie may also be associated with personally identifiable information we may have collected about you, but never exposes you to privacy issues.
    
    You may be able to accept or reject a cookie when you visit a website or use your browser or other software to clear cookies from your hard drive. However, deleting a website's cookie may mean that our websites will not recognize you as a repeat user. As a result, you may have to re-enter information and reject the website’s cookie when you attempt to access the website again. 
    
    We may also utilize third party internet vendors to collect site traffic data using web beacons and clear GIFs or tracking pixels that can be embedded in our websites. These vendors provide us with completely anonymous usage data that allows us to improve our websites. This usage data cannot in any way be associated with any personally identifiable information we have about you, and therefore does not jeopardize your privacy or the security of your personally identifiable information.
    
* Security of information transmissions
    
    When you fill out a form or request information on our websites, your privacy and the information you give us is protected using encryption technology called Secure Sockets Layer or SSL, typically indicated by https in the website’s address, at the top of the page. This technology scrambles transmissions to ensure the security of your personally identifiable information and make it unreadable to third parties. 
    
    Although we will do everything we can to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information, internet transmissions are not always entirely secure. For example, regular email is unencrypted and may not be secure. Cybercrime is becoming more and more frequent. To protect your privacy, please do not use unencrypted email to communicate information that you want kept confidential and always make sure you are on a secure page of our website when transmitting personally identifiable information. Equitable is not liable for the unintended disclosure of information due to errors in your transmission of information to us via email or unauthorized acts of or breaches of the security of your email account by third parties. 
    
* Your privacy and links to and from other websites
    
    You may be able to reach Equitable websites through links ("hyperlinks") from other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. You may also use hyperlinks from our websites to reach third party websites. Third party sites may have different privacy policies controlling the collection and use of your personally identifiable information than ours. A link to or from a third-party site is not an endorsement by us of their site, content, privacy practices or sponsoring organization. We cannot be responsible for the practices, content, security or accuracy of third-party sites.
    
* Security and third parties
    
    We may work with third party companies to share content between our websites and other company sites or to provide us with analytical services so that we can better understand our visitors. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and similar mechanisms to collect information when you click on or move your cursor over buttons on a website. We may access this information to identify other websites that you have visited. However, these third parties do not collect personally identifiable information (unless you explicitly provide it to them), and we do not give any personally identifiable information to them. These third parties may collect certain non-personally identifiable information such as what website a visitor came from, your IP address, and what type of browser you are using. We do not control the dissemination of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar mechanisms. You should check the relevant third-party websites for their privacy policies as well as information about how to reject cookies or other tracking mechanisms.
    
* Privacy rights for residents of certain states
    
    Some state laws grant additional privacy rights to their residents.
    
    * California residents should click [here](https://equitable.com/about-us/privacy/ccpa-privacy-policy) to learn more about their privacy rights and how to exercise them.
    
* Changes to our privacy policy
    
    We may make changes to our Privacy Notice in the future. If you are a client, we will not make any change affecting you without first sending you a revised notice describing the change. Similar changes will also be described on our websites.

How to help ensure the security of your personal information
------------------------------------------------------------

Personally identifiable information
-----------------------------------

* What is Personal Identifiable Information (PII)?
    
    The term personal identifiable information refers to information which can be used to distinguish an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. or other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.
    
    **Public PII** is information that can easily gathered from public records, phone books, corporate directories, and Government websites. This list includes name, address, phone number, or email address.
    
    **Non-public PII** is information such information includes biometric and medical information, Banking Information (PCI), and unique identifiers such as passport or Social Security numbers.
    
* Protect your identity and your privacy
    
    #### Steps you can take to protect your identity
    
    * Delete all suspicious emails without opening them.  Only open email attachments if you are confident that they are trustworthy and will not threaten your security.
    * Beware of “Phishing” scams as these can easily endanger your privacy and security. Phishing emails look like legitimate emails coming from someone you know but ask you to respond to the email or go to a website and provide your password or other confidential or personally identifiable information.  Criminals will then use this information to commit fraud.   If you are unsure about an email, always call the company that sent you the email to verify the request, using a published telephone number they have previously provided.
    * Do not send confidential or personally identifiable information via email; it is not secure unless it is encrypted. Check to be sure that commercial websites you visit have security measures in place, such as using secure transmission measures (usually Secure Sockets Layer or SSL), typically indicated by a key or padlock icon. Financial institutions and major online retailers should always use these security measures,
    * Always log out of websites that require an ID and password, instead of just exiting or continuing to browse other sites, to ensure your personally identifiable information is properly deleted from both the vendor’s system and your PC.
    * When using instant messenger services, be wary of links sent to you by those on your “buddy list.” Screen names can be hijacked to send viruses or other malicious software to your computer. If you’re unsure, call or email your friend to make sure they sent the text and the link to you, and ensure that the link is legitimate.
    
    #### Some warning signs that your identity was stolen, or security breached
    
    To help protect your privacy, identity and personally identifiable information, do not assume any unexplained financial, bank, or credit card charges, withdrawals or other transactions are simple mistakes and will be corrected on your next statement.  Follow-up with your financial institution immediately if any of the following occur unexpectedly:
    
    * Unexplained charges or deductions appear on your account.
    * Your account statements or bills have not arrived on time.
    * Renewal credit cards do not arrive on time.
    * New credit cards are sent to you that you did not request.
    * Your credit applications are denied or limited without apparent reason.
    * Billing agencies, creditors and others contact you about unknown goods and services.
    
    Any of these unexpected issues could mean that your identity was stolen, and your privacy and security are at risk.
