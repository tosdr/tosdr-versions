DMCA Copyright Policy
=====================

JWP, Inc. (“JW Player”, “Company”) has adopted the following general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders immediately upon subsequent violation. The address of the Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (“Designated Agent”) is listed at the bottom of this page. Please note that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements below, your DMCA notice or counter-notification may not be processed. 

Remember that your use of JW Player’s Services is at all times subject to the [Terms of Service](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/tos/?hsLang=en) located at [https://www.jwplayer.com/tos/](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/tos/?hsLang=en) which incorporates this DMCA Copyright Policy. Any terms we use in this DMCA Copyright Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [Terms of Service](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/tos/?hsLang=en) located at [https://www.jwplayer.com/tos/](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/tos/?hsLang=en)

I. Reporting Copyright Infringement:
------------------------------------

If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through JW Player’s websites or services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1. Your contact information, including address, telephone number and, if available, your e-mail address;
2. Identification of the works or materials being infringed;
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that JW Player is capable of finding and verifying its existence (e.g. the URL);
4. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material identified in I(3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
5. A statement made **under penalty of perjury** that the information provided is accurate and you are authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner; and
6. Your physical or electronic signature.

**UNDER SECTION 512(f) OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT, 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY MATERIALLY MISREPRESENTS THAT MATERIAL OR ACTIVITY IS INFRINGING MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY.**

II. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:

1. Remove or disable access to the infringing material;
2. Notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and
3. Terminate such content provider’s access to the Services if such content provider is a repeat offender.

III. Counter-Notification
-------------------------

If you believe that your material has been removed or access to your material has been disabled due to mistake or misidentification (e.g., because your material is not infringing or you have the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or, pursuant to the law), please provide a counter-notification containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1. Your contact information, including address, telephone number and, if available, your e-mail address;
2. Identification of the material that was removed or to which access has been disabled including information regarding the location of the infringing material before it was removed or disabled, with sufficient detail so that JW Player is capable of finding it and verifying its existence (e.g. the URL);
3. A statement made under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification;
4. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, any judicial district in which JW Player is located (including the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York), and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice or an agent of that person; and
5. Your physical or electronic signature.

**UNDER SECTION 512(f) OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT, 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY MATERIALLY MISREPRESENTS THAT MATERIAL WAS REMOVED OR DISABLED BY MISTAKE OR MISIDENTIFICATION MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY.**

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, JW Player may, in its discretion, forward a copy of your counter-notification to the person who submitted the original notice of infringement informing that person that JW Player may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. If JW Player does not receive notice that a lawsuit for copyright infringement has been filed against the content provider accused of committing infringement, we may replace or restore access to the removed materials in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, atJW Player’s discretion. Until that time, your materials will remain removed.
