For Terms of Service applicable to JW Player versions numbered 7.0-7.99, please see [JW7 Terms of Service](https://www.jwplayer.com/jw7-tos/?hsLang=en) located at [https://www.jwplayer.com/jw7-tos/](https://www.jwplayer.com/jw7-tos/?hsLang=en) (the “Standard JW7 Terms of Service”). Publisher’s rights and licenses to Use Products are limited to the Editions for which it has enrolled, is eligible and has paid all Fees (for paid Editions) in accordance with these Terms of Service. Any Use of the Products other than as permitted by these Terms of Service is strictly prohibited. The Company reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted hereunder.

Enterprise Edition Publishers under the Standard JW7 Terms of Service may elect and shall be deemed to upgrade to the then-current JW Player version 8.x and shall be subject to these Terms of Service by Using such version 8.x, provided, (a) Publisher’s Use of JW Player version 7.x is not pursuant to any mutually agreed document that materially alters the terms of the Standard JW 7 Terms of Service; and (b) Publisher is not in breach of any of its obligations to Company. By electing such upgrade, Publisher acknowledges that its Order Form (including any Plays or volumes set forth therein) remains operative throughout the remainder of the Term and such upgrade does not create any duplicative right.

OEM License
-----------

Upon explicit written approval by the Company to act as an OEM and subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and Publisher’s observance thereof, the Company grants, in object code form, to Publisher, a non-exclusive, limited subscription license, solely for the Purpose, to (a) incorporate the object code version of the applicable Products in the Application Package, (b) reproduce and distribute the applicable Products as incorporated into the Application Package, (c) modify and enhance the applicable Products as incorporated into the Application Package, and (d) reproduce and distribute any such modifications or enhancements, subject to the License Scope listed above. The foregoing rights may be sublicensed through multiple tiers of distribution, including resellers, provided each reseller or other distributor is contractually required to abide by the requirements of this Section. Publisher shall ensure that any Application Package incorporating the applicable Products shall be governed by a license agreement that is at least as protective to the Company as are the Company’s Terms of Service in the Application Package. Unless explicit written approval is given by Company to Publisher to act as an OEM, any references to OEM terms, such as an OEM License, OEM Support, or other OEM provisions, shall be inapplicable.

An OEM License may be authorized only in connection with the Enterprise Edition. Publishers with any Edition other than Enterprise Edition and Publishers with an Enterprise Edition without an OEM License authorized on an applicable Order Form are strictly prohibited from incorporating a Product into any Application Package or incorporating a Product into any goods or services, other than those authorized under subsections (i) – (iii) of the Purpose. Publisher is strictly prohibited from incorporating a Product into any goods or services, other than with respect to the authorized Application Package and those authorized under subsections (i) – (iii) of the Purpose.

Publisher shall be responsible for all OEM Support under the OEM License. OEM may assign up to five (5) designated support contacts from OEM’s company to contact the Company by providing notice to the Company. OEM’s customers may not contact the Company directly for OEM Support. OEM further agrees, at its own expense, to be adequately trained on providing Product support to OEM’s customers.

License Scope
-------------

The License Scope varies by Edition and the licenses granted hereunder are limited accordingly. Unless otherwise provided, licenses are personal to Publisher for its own Use. If you would like more information about upgrading to the Enterprise Edition, please contact us at [www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/](https://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/?hsLang=en) or sales@jwplayer.com.

Editions have the following License Scope (volume per month where applicable)\*\*:

![](https://jwplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/license-scope.jpg)

+”Free” license edition was previously referred to as “Developer.”

\* License Scope for the Enterprise Edition shall be as explicitly provided on an applicable Order Form or checkout page, and where License Scope items are provided on the applicable Order Form but limits are not explicitly set, Content Plays shall be limited to 200,000, Websites shall be limited to 1, Hosting shall be limited to 150 GB, and Streaming shall be limited to 500 GB. Except as explicitly provided on an applicable Order Form, Ad Plays for Editions with ads enabled shall be limited to the applicable number of Content Plays, and Overage Rates for Ad Plays shall be equal to that for Content Plays. Except as explicitly agreed to otherwise, Overage Rates for Content Plays for all Editions other than Enterprise and Enterprise Trial shall be $2.50 per thousand.

^Content hosted using our Services utilizes more GBs than the uploaded Content because the Services creates multiple versions of the Content at various resolutions.

\*\*License Scope for customers purchasing an Enterprise Express 5 license through the AWS Marketplace shall be subject to the following annual consumption limits: Content Plays shall be limited to 600,000, Streaming shall be limited to 72,000 GB, and Hosting shall be limited to 1,000 GB. Websites shall be limited to 1. OEM, SDK, and Live Streaming are not applicable to this license type. Per-Video, Real-Time, and Custom analytics are available for this license type. 

In order to ensure maximum performance and protect the experience of all users, requests to the JW Platform API (presently accessed via api.jwplatform.com) may not exceed sixty (60) per minute, or any other limit set forth in the applicable technical documentation. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not limit Publisher’s Plays per minute and reflects a number of requests unlikely to be reached through normal Use, the excess of which would be abusive. In addition to any other remedies provided by these Terms of Service, the Company reserves the right to immediately suspend accounts that exceed the maximum API requests set forth herein and to terminate, block and/or blacklist such accounts if Company believes in its reasonable discretion that such excess is due to Publisher’s abusive behavior.

Publishers using the Free Edition or Developer Edition may not modify or customize the menu that appears when an End User right-clicks (or other equivalent action) on a video.

Live Streaming Usage shall also count against the Streaming limits.

Advertisements
--------------

Publishers who have not purchased the Platinum Edition, Business Edition, Enterprise Trial Edition or ads-enabled Enterprise Edition are strictly prohibited from using the Products in any manner to display advertisements. Such prohibition includes actions such as (i) the making or use of any Adaptation that enables any type of advertisement to be shown in, on or around the Products (e.g., a skin), (ii) interoperation of the Products with any software that serves advertisements and (iii) adding advertisements to a playlist.

Registration
------------

Publisher is strictly prohibited from providing false or misleading sign-up information, including using a name, address or email address owned or controlled by another person without appropriate authorization. Company reserves the right to refuse registration or cancel any account that it reasonably believes is in violation of the foregoing. Publisher shall be responsible for maintaining the secrecy of its password and is liable for all activities that occur on its account. Publisher agrees to immediately notify the Company of any unauthorized use of Publisher’s username, password or other breach of account security.

Adaptations
-----------

Publisher is authorized to make Adaptations reasonably necessary to exercise its rights under these Terms of Service. All Adaptations created by Publisher are strictly for Use in connection with the Purpose. Publisher is solely responsible to ensure that its Adaptations (except the Products incorporated therein) comply with all applicable laws and regulations and do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party. Company reserves the right to prohibit the Use or Distribution of any Adaptation that it reasonably believes violates or is likely to violate such laws, regulations or rights and if Publisher fails to cure the foregoing within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof.

SDK
---

Company may update the SDKs at any time and is under no obligation to provide notice thereof. Updates may have features or functionality that differ from that of the current SDKs. Company may identify certain updates as being critical (e.g., updates that address significant security issues) by written notice (including e-mail to the address provided by Publisher). Publisher shall incorporate such critical updates into its SDK Applications and, if such SDK Applications have been Distributed, shall use its best efforts to provide a public update thereto. Company shall not be liable for, and Publisher shall indemnify and hold Company harmless for, Losses due to Publisher’s failure to take the foregoing steps with respect to a critical update.

Publisher acknowledges that development for each Operating System may be subject to the applicable Operating System provider’s own rules, regulations, standards and requirements and that Company has no control or responsibility therefor. Publisher is solely responsible for its compliance with the foregoing and Company makes no representations or warranties of compatibility with any Operating System.

JW Showcase
-----------

Company may update JW Showcase at any time and is under no obligation to provide notice thereof. Updates may have features or functionality that differ from that of the current JW Showcase. Company may identify certain updates as being critical (e.g., updates that address significant security issues) by written notice (including e-mail to the address provided by Publisher). Publisher shall incorporate such critical updates into its JW Showcase Implementations. Company shall not be liable for, and Publisher shall indemnify and hold Company harmless for, Losses due to Publisher’s failure to take the foregoing steps with respect to a critical update.

Beta Products
-------------

For the purposes of these Terms of Service, “Beta Products” means products, features, programs or services identified by Company as beta products, or which are made available by Company to Beta Participant and which are not yet generally available. If Publisher Uses any Beta Products, Publisher’s Use of any such Beta Product(s) constitutes unconditional agreement to be bound by, and such Use shall be subject to, the JW Player [Beta Program Agreement](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/beta-program-agreement?hsLang=en) with respect to such Beta Product(s).

Distribution
------------

Except pursuant to the Purpose or as otherwise specifically set forth herein, Publisher shall not Distribute, re-license, sell, lease, transfer, encumber, assign or make available for public use the Products or any Adaptation thereof. Any attempt to take any such actions is void and constitutes a material breach of these Terms of Service.

Term
----

These Terms of Service shall become effective on the Effective Date. For all Editions other than the (i) Enterprise Trial Edition or (ii) Enterprise Edition if otherwise set forth on an applicable Order Form, these Terms of Service shall remain effective for a period of one (1) year (the “Initial Term”). Upon the conclusion of the Initial Term, these Terms of Service shall automatically renew for additional successive one (1) year terms, except in the case of the Enterprise Edition which shall renew for additional successive terms for the same period as the Initial Term (each a “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term and any Negotiation Period(s), the “Term”). Such renewal shall be at the then-current non-promotional rate, unless Publisher opts out of auto-renewal by electing to not renew these Terms of Service as set forth in the following paragraph. The Enterprise Trial Edition’s Term shall be 30 days unless otherwise mutually agreed by Publisher and Company and set forth on an applicable Order Form.

Either party may elect to not renew these Terms of Service by notifying the other prior to the expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term. Such notice may be provided by Publisher either via email to customer support or through the Publisher dashboard. Notice for the Enterprise Edition must be provided in writing no later than thirty (30) days prior to such expiration. If Publisher terminates these Terms of Service, Publisher may use Publisher’s subscription until the end of Publisher’s then-current term and Publisher’s subscription will not be renewed after Publisher’s then-current term expires. However, Publisher won’t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. IF PUBLISHER DOES NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING BASIS, PUBLISHER MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TERMS OF SERVICE BY NOTIFYING COMPANY BEFORE THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT INITIAL TERM OR RENEWAL TERM, WHICH FOR ENTERPRISE EDITION SHALL BE NO LATER THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT INITIAL TERM OR RENEWAL TERM. THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH PUBLISHER HAS ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, COMPANY WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT PUBLISHER HAS ALREADY PAID.

Publisher’s non-termination or continued use of Products or Editions reaffirms that Company is authorized to charge Publisher’s designated payment form for such Products or Editions. Company may submit those charges for payment and Publisher will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive Company’s right to seek payment directly from Publisher. Publisher’s charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when Publisher initially selected to use the Products or Editions. Publisher hereby acknowledges that it will not receive notice of a renewal cancellation date or automatic renewal and expressly waives the application of New York General Obligations Law Section 5-903, and any similar laws, to the renewal of these Terms of Service.

If Company has provided notice of non-renewal to an Enterprise Edition Publisher in accordance with the above mechanism, and the parties are negotiating in good faith to agree a new Order Form, and Publisher continues to Use the products beyond the effective date of expiration without such new Order Form having been executed by a duly authorized representative of each party, Publisher will be deemed to have renewed for a one (1) month term (a “Negotiation Period”); provided that Company may in its sole discretion notify Publisher that such Negotiation Period will not occur, in which case these Terms of Service will expire as provided herein. Publisher will for the Negotiation Period be invoiced, and will pay in accordance with the payment terms herein, one-twelfth of the annual Fees provided on the applicable Order Form, and the License Scope for Content Plays, Hosting and Streaming will be one-twelfth of the annual limits provided on such Order Form. The Negotiation Period will not renew without the written consent (email sufficing) of Company. The foregoing shall not affect either party’s rights to terminate these Terms of Service as provided herein.

Termination
-----------

These Terms of Service are subject to termination by Company immediately and/or Publisher’s account may be suspended if (a) Publisher fails to timely pay a Fee or Overages, (b) Publisher violates any term of these Terms of Service, including the provisions regarding Prohibited Content or the [Content Guidelines](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/tos-content-guidelines?hsLang=en) (c) Publisher becomes insolvent, declares bankruptcy or a receiver or trustee is appointed for Publisher, (d) Publisher is or becomes engaged in a business that is competitive with the Company’s business, or (e) Publisher exceeds the License Scope permitted for its Edition and Publisher fails to cure any of the foregoing within seven (7) days of notice thereof.

In the event of the Company’s termination for convenience, Publisher shall, on its request, be given a pro rata refund of unused pre-paid Fees. In the event Publisher switches to a different Edition, any pre-paid Fee balance shall be applied towards the Fees due for such Edition until exhausted; no refund shall be available for Publishers switching to a Free Edition or a Developer Edition.

Upon expiration or termination, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties shall cease, except that all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of expiration or termination and remedies for breach of these Terms of Service shall survive. The provisions of the Sections titled Effects of Termination, Intellectual Property, Privacy, Fees and Payment, Content, Representations and Warranties, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Basis of the Bargain, Indemnity, Audit, Confidential Information, Severability, Choice of Law and Jurisdiction, Injunctive Relief, Complete Agreement and Waiver of Breach shall also survive.

Publisher shall place prominently and maintain on all locations on which it Uses the Products, and comply with, a privacy statement or policy that adheres to or exceeds applicable law, regulations and industry self-regulatory programs.

Publisher will register all video Content with a Media ID (an 8-digit identifier) in accordance with the Documentation and will initiate all Plays using the applicable Media ID. Publisher is strictly prohibited from removing, altering, disabling or circumventing the Licensing Key or Service Analytics or otherwise interfering with the operation thereof.

Publisher (not the Company) is responsible for any statements and omissions in Publisher’s privacy policy. Further, while we may recommend language for you to insert in your privacy policy, this does not change the foregoing, and Publisher should not rely on any such recommendations as or as a substitute for legal advice.

Such suspension shall not affect Publisher’s duty to pay all Fees or Overages due under any Order Form or Addendum or constitute termination of these Terms of Service absent Company’s notice of termination pursuant to the Termination section hereof. Past-due Fees and Overages shall incur interest at a rate of one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is lesser.
