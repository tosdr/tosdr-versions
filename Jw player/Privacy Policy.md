### Introduction

JW Player (legally known as LongTail Ad Solutions, Inc.) is a leading video player software and video management platform (collectively, the “**JW Player Technology**”). Our customers are businesses that use the JW Player Technology to host, embed and stream, and deliver advertising to, digital video over the web (collectively, the “**JW Player Services**”).

JW Player has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the information we collect from:

* Visitors to our website located at [www.jwplayer.com](https://www.jwplayer.com/) (the “**Corporate Website**”), including all subdomains,
* Users who watch our customers’ videos on websites, apps, mobile apps, and other software powered by the JW Player Technology (each, a “**Customer Property**”) using a desktop or laptop PC, mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other device, and
* Visitors to our other owned-and-operated websites (each, a “**JW Player Website**”), including [www.jwshowcase.com](https://www.jwshowcase.com/) and [tv.jwplayer.com](https://tv.jwplayer.com/).

This Privacy Policy does _not_ describe the information collection practices of our customers that use the JW Player Technology on their Customer Properties. We are a third-party service provider to our customers. We recommend that you refer to our customers’ privacy policies to learn about their information collection practices.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy.** 

JW Player will update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. We will post all Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. The Privacy Policy posted on this page will say when that version went into effect. If you visit the Corporate Website or view a video on a Customer Property after a change, then you will have accepted JW Player’s new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

### A. Corporate Website at [www.jwplayer.com](https://www.jwplayer.com/)

The Corporate Website collects Personal Data, Usage Data, and Tracking Data when you visit the site at [www.jwplayer.com](https://www.jwplayer.com/).

**As used in our discussion about the Corporate Website in this Section A:**

“**Personal Data**” is the information about an individual that can be used to identify that individual. If you access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we use a [different definition of Personal Data](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/privacy/) to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

“**Tracking Data**” is the information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g., pixel tags, web beacons, or scripts) that we use to keep track of visitor activity on the Corporate Website. (Note that the Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology is different, and is discussed in Section B.)

* **Cookies** are small files that contain a small amount of data, typically including a unique identifier. They are generally placed on your browser by a website or other browser-based service. Our Corporate Website uses cookies.
* **Other tracking technologies**, in the context of the Corporate Website, include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used to track usage and performance. (See Section B below for the tracking technologies used by the JW Player Technology.)

“**Usage Data**”, in the context of the Corporate Website, is the information that your browser sends to JW Player’s servers when you visit the Corporate Website.

As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time your browser or device interacts with the Corporate Website, and store that information in “log files.” The information stored in our web servers’ log files includes information that we call Personal Data, Usage Data and Tracking Data, and that we describe more fully in the following sections.

If you do not have a login to the Corporate Website (_e.g._, a prospective customer or a website visitor) and would like to access, change, or delete the Personal Data that you have previously provided to the Corporate Website, you can contact us by emailing us at [privacy@jwplayer.com](mailto:privacy@jwplayer.com) to make the requested changes.

JW Player uses third-party advertising companies to advertise JW Player and the JW Player Services.

This process is sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising. If you want more information about these third-party advertising companies, or if you wish to opt out of this type of advertising, please visit the ad industry choice mechanism at [www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

#### 6\. Transfer Of Information.

As JW Player works with global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided. This may be intra-group or to third parties that we work with who are likely located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United States and process it there.

**Note for visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:** If we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we will take steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. 

### B. JW Player Technology

#### 1\. Information Collected By JW Player Technology About Users

Our customers are primarily web publishers (each, a “**Customer**”) that deploy JW Player Technology on their [Customer Properties](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/privacy/#CustomerProperty) to provide their visitors (each, a “**User**”) with a high-quality video viewing experience. In Section B, we describe the information that is collected from Users who view videos and ads on a Customer Property. The JW Player Technology collects **Usage Data** and **Tracking Data** from Users.

Note that the Tracking Technologies used in the JW Player Technology are different from the Tracking Technologies used on the Corporate Website.

#### 2\. About Usage Data And Tracking Data

##### a. Usage Data and Tracking Data Collected by the JW Player Technology.

The JW Player Technology collects Usage Data and Tracking Data from a User when he or she views video on a Customer Property. As used in our discussion about the JW Player Technology in this Section B:

“**Usage Data**” is the information that a User’s browser automatically sends to JW Player’s servers when a User accesses video or sees an ad on a Customer Property. This information includes a User’s device type, screen resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.

“**Tracking Data**” is the information collected by the JW Player Technology from Users who access videos on a Customer Property, and consists primarily of the following:

**1\. Proprietary tracking technologies** used by the JW Player Technology for video delivery and performance reporting. These tracking technologies include the following:

* Local ID, which is stored on a User’s computer to identify a User’s player on a given Customer Property.
* Global ID, which is stored on a User’s browser and JW Player’s servers and identifies a User across different players and Customer Properties. **The JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to Users whose Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK.**
* Viewer ID, which is stored on JW Player’s servers to identify a User. Other tracking technologies include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used for ad delivery and reporting.

As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time a User’s browser or device interacts with the JW Player Technology, and store that information in “**log files.**” The information stored in our web servers’ log files includes Usage Data and Tracking Data. The Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology include:

* Information collected through tracking technologies.
* Browser type and version.
* User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address.
* Unique identifiers set by our tracking technologies to identify video players, Users, and video sessions.
* If a User is accessing the JW Player Technology through a mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other device: the type of device, unique device ID, device IP address, device operating system, and diagnostic data.
* Information about how a User interacts with the JW Player Technology, such as the date and time of a User’s visit, the videos watched, and the time spent watching those videos.
* Other aggregated information.

**Note for visitors who access the JW Player Technology from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:**

* **Personal Data.** As previously noted, some elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data – for example, a visitor’s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) – are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we treat those elements as Personal Data when collected by the JW Player Technology from Users whose IP addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK. Note that the JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to a User accessing the JW Player Technology from an EEA, Swiss or UK IP address. We will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the security or integrity of the JW Player Services or JW Player Technology, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.
* **Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.** For Users who access the JW Player Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR. The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “**data controllers**”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “**data processors**”). When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with the JW Player Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data. If you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which the JW Player Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.  
    With that in mind, if you have concerns about JW Player, you may contact our privacy officer, at [privacy@jwplayer.com](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/privacy).  
    \*\*Note for California Residents who visit our Customer Properties\*\* Similar to the above, when our technology is employed on a website (or a mobile property or other service), we generally act as a “service provider” to the website provider for purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act – i.e., providing them services to help them display, curate and/or integrate content shown through our player technology. Thus, if you If you have questions about personal information collected or used by a Customer Property on which the JW Player Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact the particular website or content provider that you are engaging with. (If you have questions about information that we collect when you visit our Corporate Website(s), please go to SectionA(1).

##### b. How We May Use Usage Data and Tracking Data.

We use Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology for the following purposes:

* Deliver video to Customer Properties, and ads on behalf of advertisers.
* Recommend videos that a User may enjoy.
* Prepare reports and analytics for our customers.
* For our other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, diagnosing technical problems, operating, maintaining, enhancing and improving the JW Player Technology and JW Player Service, and developing new products and services.
* As we believe appropriate for [Compliance Purposes](https://www.jwplayer.com/legal/privacy/#Compliance).

##### c. When We May Disclose Usage and Tracking Data.

We may disclose Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology for the following purposes:

* **Service Providers.** To third-party service providers who provide services such as hosting, data analysis, IT infrastructure, IT services, customer service, auditing, security, fraud, and other similar functions to us or our Customers.

#### 3\. User Choices For The JW Player Technology

##### a. For Users who access the JW Player Technology from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK: The Do Not Track Browser Setting.

Certain versions of the JW Player Technology support Do Not Track for Users in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Do Not Track is a preference Users can set in their web browser to inform websites that they do not want to be tracked. Users can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of their web browser. We make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility between our technology and Do Not Track functionality across different web browsers.
