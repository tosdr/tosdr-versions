In addition, we may ask for your country of residence and/or your organization's country of operation, so that we can comply with applicable laws and regulations. This information is used for billing, order processing and internal marketing as well as to communicate with you about your order and our site.

**Email Addresses:** Several locations on the Site allow you to enter your email address for purposes including but not limited to: registering for free promotional notices, requesting notification when new brands or product styles arrive, or signing up for our email newsletter. In addition, any participation in promotional contests organized by Xtrix TV is completely voluntary and requires disclosure of contact information needed to notify winners and award prizes.

(An IP address may indicate the location of your computer on the Internet.)   
    **Product Reviews:** We ask for an email address and location along with the submission of all product reviews. Your email address will be kept private, but your location will be visible to other users. All other personal information that you choose to submit as part of the review will be available to other visitors to the Site.

**How does Xtrix TV use cookies and other technology to collect information?**

Cookies are small pieces of information that your Internet browser stores as text files on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers accept cookies by default, but setting your browser to refuse cookies or remove them from your hard drive will prevent you from using parts of this Site. Xtrix TV uses cookies to

   \* recognize users and user access privileges   
   \* enable selection and purchase products on this Site record your browsing activity and purchases  
  
**This Site's cookies do not and cannot infiltrate a user’s hard drive to gather any confidential information.**  
This Site also uses web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or "action tags") to:   
   \* help deliver cookies   
   \* track views of a web page  
  
Any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon. We may use content or ads from third-party advertising companies that may use cookies and web beacons to measure web page visits or amount of products purchased.   
**Any information these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information we collect.**  
  
**How does Xtrix TV use my personal information?**  
**Internal Use:** We use your personal information to process your order and provide you with customer service. We may use your personal information internally to collect general information about visitors to this Site, improve Site content and layout, improve our outreach, and market our services and products.

We may send you a confirmation email or a SMS verification after you register with us as well as service-related announcements as necessary (for example, temporary suspension of service for maintenance.)

You can unsubscribe or opt out of future emails at any time (see the Opt Out/Corrections section below for more details).

**Does Xtrix TV ever give out my personal information?**

We sell merchandise, not information ****— We do not sell, rent, trade, license, or otherwise disclose your personal or financial information to anyone, except in the following specific situations:  
      
Third-party service providers:**** Like most online retailers, we sometimes use third-party service providers to perform specific functions on our behalf. Any information disclosed to them is solely to help in their provision of service. For example, we provide your name, shipping address, email and phone number to partners such as DHL and UPS in order to guarantee delivery of your orders, and we may use relevant customer information in order to monitor the quality of the third party’s service.  
Similarly, we must provide your credit card number to financial services organizations such as credit card processors and issuers in order to process payments. We protect all submissions of your credit card number for authorization with state-of-the-art data encryption. (More on this below in the Data Security section.)  
  
**Legal requirement to disclose information:** We may be required to disclose information if subpoenaed, served with a court order or requested by law-enforcement officials conducting investigations, or if we are otherwise required by law to disclose such information. We will also release personal information when necessary to protect our legal rights or enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud, or to prevent fraud by users who attempt fraud or other illegal activity on our Site.  
  
**Merger and/or sale of assets:** We do not normally sell, trade or rent personal information   
to other companies in the course of our business. However, it is possible that we might acquire, merge with or be acquired by another company, or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets, in which case your personal information could be disclosed to another company, subject to the Privacy Notice in effect.  
  
**Non-personally identifiable information:** We may share information that does not identify you or any user, such as the number of daily visitors to a particular page, or the size of an order placed on a certain date, with third parties such as advertising partners.

#### **How does Xtrix TV secure information collected about me?**

This Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as:   
     \* Safeguarding all financial transactions done through this Site with Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") encryption   
     \* Granting only employees who are providing a specific service access to your personal information   
     \* Working only with third-party service providers who we believe adequately secure all computer hardware.   
**While our business is designed with safeguarding your personal information in mind, please remember that 100% security does not presently exist anywhere, online or offline.**

If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information to us, and rely on a parent or guardian to assist you when using the Site.

#### How does Xtrix TV use and disclose information collected from me offline?

As Xtrix TV collects most information through our Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to online collection of personal information.  
We also protect all personal information that is collected from you offline, such as through phone calls. If we contact you by telephone regarding an order or payment, we will ask only for the personal information needed to place your order or resolve your issue. When we need to store information related to an order, we enter it into our database through SSL encryption (See the Data Security section above for more information).  
  
This Policy does not attempt to cover all possible offline methods of collecting or using personal information, however, we will treat any offline collection, use, or disclosure of personal information in a manner consistent with our online practices.

#### Where can I find updates to this policy?

To keep you informed of what information we collect, use, and disclose, we will post any changes or updates to this Privacy Notice on this Site and encourage you to review this Privacy Notice from time to time. Please contact us with any questions about the Privacy Notice.
