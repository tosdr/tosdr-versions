We may disclose certain information (such as your email address) to other parties – such as Facebook (more info on Facebook Custom Audience [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads)) so that we can better target ads and content to our users, and others with similar interests on these external platforms or networks (“Custom Audiences”).

If you would like to opt-out of being included in our Custom Audiences going forward, contact us [here](https://privacyportal-de.onetrust.com/webform/f69c0bf1-10ab-4d33-8b59-e235ddd37a5f/bdbf15da-7460-4391-a756-c95ab3408996) and we will opt you out of our future Custom Audiences.

**Interest-based Ads**  
  
We work with others (“ad companies”) to display more relevant advertising on our Services, and to manage our advertising on other sites, mobile apps and online Services.

These ad companies may use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content and to evaluate the success of such ads and content. As a result, our ads may be displayed to you on a search results page or on other sites.

#### How You Can Control Cookies

You may control how Facebook and other parties display certain ads to you, as explained further in their respective privacy policies and ad preferences pages.

Opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being served advertising altogether. You may continue to receive generic or contextual ads on our Services. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs. Please note, that opt-out mechanisms are cookie based; so, if you delete cookies, block cookies or use another device, your opt-out will no longer be effective.

**Exercising Your Rights**

If you are a California resident and wish to request the exercise of these rights as detailed above or have questions regarding the California Personal Information collected or shared with third parties, please call us at 1-800-CLIFBAR (1-800-254-3227) (toll free), or you can submit your request online by using our [Individual Rights Request Form](https://privacyportal-de.onetrust.com/webform/f69c0bf1-10ab-4d33-8b59-e235ddd37a5f/521723b1-b80b-4dd8-a300-73fbe2979689).

**Authorized Agents**

To the extent that you elect to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, the authorized agent must provide appropriate documentation including written signed permission from you, proof of your identity, and verification of the agent’s identity; a valid, designated power of attorney as defined under the California Probate Code, and certificate of registration as an agent before the California Secretary of State. If you are an agent submitting the request on behalf of a California consumer, please use our [Individual Rights Request Form](https://privacyportal-de.onetrust.com/webform/f69c0bf1-10ab-4d33-8b59-e235ddd37a5f/521723b1-b80b-4dd8-a300-73fbe2979689).

Participation in these Programs is voluntary and requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time by following the instructions provided in such terms. Information collected via these programs may include email address and other contact information, demographic information, and opinions.

Because our programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” under California law or as a "loyalty program" under other US state privacy laws.

Furthermore, we may delete California Personal Information from our database at any time and without providing any reason.
