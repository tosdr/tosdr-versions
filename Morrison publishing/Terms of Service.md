**THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS THAT WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A COURT HEARING, RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. ARBITRATION IS MANDATORY AND IS THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES UNLESS SPECIFIED BELOW.**

**Limitation of Liability**

EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MORRISON OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, AND/OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRIVACY POLICY, THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, YOUR OR A THIRD PARTY’S USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SOFTWARE, SERVICE, OR PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER MORRISON HAS HAD NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS, OR CLAIMS. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES.  THIS APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH DAMAGES ARE ALLEGEDLY CAUSED, AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE. 

IN NO EVENT SHALL MORRISON’S LIABILITY TO YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THREE (3) TIMES THE PAYMENTS PAID BY YOU TO MORRISON FOR THE MONTH PRECEDING THE DATE IN WHICH THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM AGAINST MORRISON OCCURRED OR TWO-THOUSAND DOLLARS ($2,000), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

**Dispute Resolution By Mandatory Binding Arbitration And Class Action Waiver**

PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR AND YOUR BUSINESS’ RIGHTS.  EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.  HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES) AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.

If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.morrisonpublishing.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, any affiliate agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 20 and 21 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Hinds County, Mississippi, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration.  The AAA’s Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale, the Privacy Policy, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or MorrisonPublishing.com.

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules.  In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.

The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Mississippi without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

You and MorrisonPublishing.com agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  You and MorrisonPublishing.com expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.

Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).

This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.  

This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with MorrisonPublishing.com, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer.  If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.  If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.  

**Local Laws and Export Control**

If you use this site outside the United States of America, you are responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws. MorrisonPublishing.com controls and operates this site from its headquarters in the United States of America and the Materials may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations.

**Consequences of Violation**

If you violate these terms, MorrisonPublishing.com may terminate your access to the site or Password-Restricted Areas without notice. MorrisonPublishing.com prefers to advise you of your inappropriate behavior and recommend any necessary corrective action. However, certain violations of these terms, as determined by MorrisonPublishing.com, will result in immediate termination of your access to the site or Password-Restricted Areas.

MorrisonPublishing.com reserves the right to terminate any password-restricted account for any reason. These terms are governed by Mississippi Law and controlling U.S. Federal Law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions. Any disputes relating to these terms or the site will be heard in courts located in Mississippi. If any of these terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such terms shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.

MorrisonPublishing.com’s failure to enforce any of these terms is not a waiver of such terms. These terms are the entire agreement between you and MorrisonPublishing.com and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings between you and MorrisonPublishing.com and Morrison Publishing, LLC. These terms may not be modified except pursuant to a written amendment that is executed by an officer of MorrisonPublishing.com and Morrison Publishing, LLC.
