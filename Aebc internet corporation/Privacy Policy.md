Privacy Policy
==============

Version 1.0

_Last revised on: April 25, 2018_

We take the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of the AEBC website at aebc.com (the “Site”) and the services made available through the Site provided by AEBC Internet Corp. (“AEBC”, “us”, “our”, and “we”).

### User Consent

By submitting Personal Data through our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### A Note about Children

We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13.

A Note to Users Outside of the United States

Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

### Types of Data We Collect

“Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.

### Information You Provide to Us

When you create an account (“Account”) to register for the Forum, we will collect your username, e-mail address and password. We may also collect optional information that you provide us to customize your Account, for example, your language preference, location, time zone, birthdates, occupation, interests, instant messenger ID and website.

When you post a comment on the Site, we will collect your username and e-mail address and, if you provide it, your website.

When you post comments or messages to the Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.

We retain information on your behalf, such as your postings to the Site and files and messages that you store using your Account.

If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.

When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.

We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.

We may also collect Personal Data, such as at other points in our Services that state that Personal Data is being collected.

### Information Collected via Technology

**Information Collected by Our Servers**. To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, referring/exit pages, clickstream data (including the ads you see and click on), and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used by us to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.

**Cookies.** We store small text files called “Cookies” on your computer to make your experience on our website better. We use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). In order to provide the Services, we use a variety of Cookies that perform different functions. While you will still be able to use the AEBC Internet Corp Offerings if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the AEBC Internet Corp Offerings may not function as effectively. You can find more information on Cookies and how they may affect you by visiting: [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). We use the following types of cookies:

**_Strictly Necessary Cookies_**. Strictly necessary cookies are cookies which are essential to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.

**_Performance Cookies_**. Performance cookies collect anonymized information about how you use our website. For example, these cookies may tell us which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages from our webpages. We use this information to improve how our sites work. By using our web site, you agree we can place these cookies on your device.

**_Functionality Cookies_**. Functionality Cookies allow our website to remember the choices you make, such as your login information (if any), preferred language or region you are in, and can provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. By using our web site, you agree we can place these cookies on your device.

**_Advertising Cookies_**. These cookies collect information to deliver you more relevant advertising. They may be placed by us, by third parties acting on our behalf, or by advertising networks with our permission. They remember other websites you have visited, and advertising networks may share this information with others including advertisers. By using our web site, you agree we can place these cookies on your device.

**Tracking Pixels**. In addition, we use “Tracking Pixels,” which are small transparent graphic image (usually only 1 pixel) that we place on our Site that is used to collect information about the pages you view and when you view them.

**Google Analytics**. We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

We also require you to enter a password to access your Account information. Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
