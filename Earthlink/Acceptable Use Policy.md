1\. Introduction
----------------

By using EarthLink services and/or equipment provided by EarthLink in connection therewith, which include all services that provide or include access to the Internet, including, without limitation, email services, mobile applications, hosting services (software applications and hardware), or use of the EarthLink Websites and any products or services offered on or through the EarthLink Websites (collectively, the “**EarthLink Services**” or “**Services**”), you (the “**Subscriber**”, “**user**” or “**you**”) and all others who use the Services agree to comply with the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy (“**AUP**”). The EarthLink Websites include, but are not limited to: [earthlink.net](https://www.earthlink.net/), any Webpages provided by EarthLink through earthlink.net and peoplepc.com subdomains, any third party or co-branded versions of these sites, and any successor or replacement sites.

This AUP should be read in conjunction with the [Service Agreement](https://www.earthlink.net/tcs/) for your particular EarthLink Service and the [EarthLink Privacy Policy](https://www.earthlink.net/tcs/privacy-policy/). Your failure, or others’ failure, to comply with this AUP could result in the suspension or termination of your Service or Service account(s). If you do not agree to comply with this AUP, you must immediately stop your use of the EarthLink Services and notify EarthLink to close your account.

EarthLink reserves the right to change or modify the terms of the AUP at any time effective when posted on EarthLink’s website at [earthlink.net/tcs](https://www.earthlink.net/tcs/). Your use of the Services after changes to the AUP are posted shall constitute acceptance of any changed or additional terms.

2. Violations of this Acceptable Use Policy
-------------------------------------------

The AUP prohibits uses and activities involving EarthLink Services that are illegal, infringe the rights of others, or interfere with, are not supportable by EarthLink or diminish the use and enjoyment of the EarthLink Services by others.

The remainder of this Section 2 includes a list and description of some, but not all, of the activities that constitute violations of this AUP if done using EarthLink Services or equipment, whether provided by EarthLink or customer-owned.

**Fraudulent Financial Activity**: Making or promoting fraudulent offers to sell or buy products, items, goods or services, advancing any type of illegal financial activity such as “pyramid” or “Ponzi schemes,” or fraudulently charging any method of payment (e.g. debit or credit cards).

In addition, for those Services that utilize EarthLink-provided web hosting, EarthLink reserves the right to decline to provide such services if the content is determined by EarthLink to be obscene, indecent, hateful, malicious, racist, defamatory, fraudulent, libelous, treasonous, excessively violent, promoting the use of violence, or otherwise harmful to others.

* sending electronic messages that do not accurately identify the sender, the sender’s return address, the e-mail address of origin, or other information contained in the subject line or header.

**Phishing**: Attempting to impersonate any person, group or entity, engaging in sender address or network header falsification, or forging anyone else’s digital or manual signature.

**Intellectual Property Infringement**: Transmitting, publishing, submitting/receiving, uploading/downloading, using, copying or posting or otherwise reproducing, distributing or storing any content or material that infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary or intellectual property or privacy or publicity rights of EarthLink or any third party.

**Unauthorized Use of EarthLink’s Intellectual Property**: Using any EarthLink trademark, trade name or other intellectual property in any way and in any media without EarthLink’s prior written authorization, or otherwise taking any action that improperly implies that EarthLink sponsors or is affiliated with you or your use of the EarthLink Services.

* using any program, file, script, command, or transmission of any message or content of any kind, designed to interfere with a terminal session, the access to or use of the Internet or any other means of communication;
* distributing or using tools designed to compromise security (including but not limited to SNMP tools), including cracking tools, password guessing programs, packet sniffers, or network probing tools (except in the case of authorized legitimate network security operations); and
* with respect to dial-up accounts, using any software or device designed to defeat system time-out limits or to allow Subscriber’s account to stay logged on while Subscriber is not actively using the Services or using such account for the purpose of operating a server of any type.

**Using or Distributing Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses or Other Destructive Activity that Compromise Security**: Engaging in activities that disrupt or degrade the use of or interfere with the ability of other people to effectively use EarthLink’s network or any connected network system, service or equipment including using or distributing, among other things, Internet viruses, worms, Trojan Horse programs, password guessing programs, decoders, keystroke loggers, cracking tools, packet sniggers, flooding of a network, encryption circumvention devices, or unauthorized port scanning.

**Long Connections and Multiple Logins**: Using an EarthLink Service account for high volume or commercial use is prohibited. The EarthLink Services are intended for periodic, active residential and/or small business use. You may not use the EarthLink Services on a standby or inactive basis in order to maintain a connection. Pinging is expressly prohibited.

**Network Probing**: Any type of detective network activity, including, but not limited to, port scanning and pinging.

**Terms of Use Violation**: Violating the terms of use or policies of EarthLink or any third party from or through which EarthLink provides content, including newsgroup providers.

**Usage Thresholds and Excess Usage**: EarthLink endeavors to provide the best experience for all Subscribers. Subscribers’ data usage levels may, on occasion, rise to the level of “**Excess Usage**” which can jeopardize EarthLink’s ability to maintain consistent Service. Accordingly, any overage beyond your highspeed data allotment under the terms of your EarthLink Service could be deemed Excess Usage and would be a violation of this AUP. EarthLink periodically evaluates the extent of Excess Usage to manage network traffic on behalf of all Subscribers to EarthLink Services. Subscribers can learn how to monitor their usage by contacting EarthLink in any of the manners provided at EarthLink.net/about-us/contact.
