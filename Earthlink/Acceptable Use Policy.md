EarthLink Acceptable Use Policy
===============================

**Effective Date: April 1, 2024**

1\. Introduction
----------------

By using EarthLink services and/or equipment provided by EarthLink in connection therewith, which include all services that provide or include access to the Internet, including, without limitation, email services, mobile applications, hosting services (software applications and hardware), or use of the EarthLink Websites and any products or services offered on or through the EarthLink Websites (collectively, the “**EarthLink Services**” or “**Services**”), you (the “**Subscriber**”, “**user**” or “**you**”) and all others who use the Services agree to comply with the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy (“**AUP**”). The EarthLink Websites include, but are not limited to: [earthlink.net](https://www.earthlink.net/), any Webpages provided by EarthLink through earthlink.net and peoplepc.com subdomains, any third party or co-branded versions of these sites, and any successor or replacement sites.

This AUP should be read in conjunction with the [Service Agreement](https://www.earthlink.net/tcs/) for your particular EarthLink Service and the [EarthLink Privacy Policy](https://www.earthlink.net/tcs/privacy-policy/). Your failure, or others’ failure, to comply with this AUP could result in the suspension or termination of your Service or Service account(s). If you do not agree to comply with this AUP, you must immediately stop your use of the EarthLink Services and notify EarthLink to close your account.

EarthLink reserves the right to change or modify the terms of the AUP at any time effective when posted on EarthLink’s website at [earthlink.net/tcs](https://www.earthlink.net/tcs/). Your use of the Services after changes to the AUP are posted shall constitute acceptance of any changed or additional terms.

2. Violations of this Acceptable Use Policy
-------------------------------------------

The AUP prohibits uses and activities involving EarthLink Services that are illegal, infringe the rights of others, or interfere with or diminish the use and enjoyment of the EarthLink Services by others.

The remainder of this Section 2 includes a list and description of some, but not all, of the activities that constitute violations of this AUP if done using EarthLink Services or equipment, whether provided by EarthLink or customer-owned.

**Illegal Use**: Transmitting, uploading/downloading, posting, receiving, storing, or presenting content or other material that EarthLink believes would violate or encourage conduct that would violate any applicable local, state, federal or international law or regulation including, but not limited to, content or material which is libelous, obscene, unlawful, threatening or defamatory, or regarding illegal gambling, human trafficking, illegal drugs or goods, weapons, fraud, illegal prostitution, acts of terrorism or other illegal conduct.

**Fraudulent Financial Activity**: Making or promoting fraudulent offers to sell or buy products, items, goods or services, advancing any type of illegal financial activity such as “pyramid” or “Ponzi schemes,” or fraudulently charging any method of payment (e.g. debit or credit cards).

**Harm to Minors**: Harming, attempting to harm, exploiting or encouraging the exploitation of minors in any way, including, but not limited to, the use of the EarthLink Services (i) to publish, submit/receive, distribute, solicit, present, upload/download, post, use, copy, or otherwise produce, transmit or store child pornography, or (ii) to collect, post, sell, or disclose personally identifiable or private information of children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its implementing rules and regulations.

For information about how to protect minors online and to determine the appropriate parental blocking and filtering controls for online activity, please visit the websites for [Family Online Safety Institute](https://www.fosi.org/) and [ConnectSafely](https://www.connectsafely.org/), which are advocacy groups that provide information and connections to third-party filtering tools you can use on your home computers and mobile devices.

**Threats and Harassment**: Uploading, posting, publishing, or transmitting any material that (i) threatens, harasses, defames, or encourages bodily harm or destruction of property of an individual or a group, including on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, national origin, gender or gender identity, race, religion, or sexual orientation, or (ii) espouses or promotes racism or bigotry. In addition, for those Services that utilize EarthLink-provided web hosting, EarthLink reserves the right to decline to provide such services if the content is determined by EarthLink to be obscene, indecent, hateful, malicious, racist, defamatory, fraudulent, libelous, treasonous, excessively violent, promoting the use of violence, or otherwise harmful to others.

**Spamming**: Transmitting or facilitating unsolicited or illegal commercial or bulk email.

* sending unsolicited commercial e-mail, or unsolicited electronic messages directed primarily at the advertising or promotion of products or services;
* sending bulk electronic messages without identifying, within the message, a reasonable means of opting out from receiving additional messages from the sender;

* using another site’s mail server to relay mail without express permission of that site;
* using distribution lists containing addresses that include those who have opted out;
* sending electronic messages that do not accurately identify the sender, the sender’s return address, the e-mail address of origin, or other information contained in the subject line or header.

**Phishing**: Attempting to impersonate any person, group or entity, engaging in sender address or network header falsification, or forging anyone else’s digital or manual signature.

**Intellectual Property Infringement**: Transmitting, publishing, submitting/receiving, uploading/downloading, using, copying or posting or otherwise reproducing, distributing or storing any content or material that infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary or intellectual property or privacy or publicity rights of EarthLink or any third party.

**Unauthorized Use of EarthLink’s Intellectual Property**: Using any EarthLink trademark, trade name or other intellectual property in any way and in any media without EarthLink’s prior written authorization, or otherwise taking any action that improperly implies that EarthLink sponsors or is affiliated with you or your use of the EarthLink Services.

* using any program, file, script, command, or transmission of any message or content of any kind, designed to interfere with a terminal session, the access to or use of the Internet or any other means of communication;
* distributing or using tools designed to compromise security (including but not limited to SNMP tools), including cracking tools, password guessing programs, packet sniffers, or network probing tools (except in the case of authorized legitimate network security operations); and
* with respect to dial-up accounts, using any software or device designed to defeat system time-out limits or to allow Subscriber’s account to stay logged on while Subscriber is not actively using the Services or using such account for the purpose of operating a server of any type.

**Long Connections and Multiple Logins**: Using an EarthLink Service account for high volume or commercial use is prohibited. The EarthLink Services are intended for periodic, active residential and/or small business use. You may not use the EarthLink Services on a standby or inactive basis in order to maintain a connection. Pinging is expressly prohibited.
