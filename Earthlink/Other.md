EarthLink Automatic Payments Authorization
==========================================

**Effective Date: April 1, 2024**

AUTHORIZATION
-------------

I hereby authorize and confirm that EarthLink, LLC (“**EarthLink**“) may initiate electronic recurring automated clearing house debit entries, debit or credit card payments (“**Payment Method**“) for the fees and any other monthly or ancillary charges or taxes associated with my EarthLink account from my designated Payment Method in accordance with this agreement (“**Automatic Payments Authorization**”). I further authorize EarthLink to process any refund or other credit to me to my designated Payment Method. I understand that EarthLink will continue to electronically deduct or charge my designated Payment Method on payment intervals that are based on a payment frequency plan I have preselected unless I cancel my authorization at least three (3) business days before the next scheduled payment date, as further described in the Revoking My Automatic Payments Authorization below.

PAYMENT DUE DATE
----------------

I understand that EarthLink will initiate the electronic debit or credit charge for the amount shown on my billing statement on a payment frequency plan that I have preselected. I understand that the payment due date is based on my preselected payment frequency plan and my method of payment will be charged on the due date specified on my billing statement. I acknowledge that the amount debited or charged will be the then-current balance on my account.

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EARTHLINK SHALL BEAR NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES OF ANY KIND THAT I MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF A PAYMENT MADE ON ITEMS INCORRECTLY BILLED OR FOR ANY DELAY IN THE ACTUAL DATE ON WHICH MY ACCOUNT IS DEBITED OR CHARGED.

PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION
--------------------------

I understand that I am responsible for providing EarthLink with valid and accurate Payment Method information. I agree to notify EarthLink of any change to my Payment Method. I understand that failure to do so may result in denied credit or debit payments, and cancellation by EarthLink of my Automatic Payments Authorization.I further acknowledge that if I have provided EarthLink with more than one Payment Method, this Automatic Payment Authorization applies to each such Payment Method, individually. If I have designated one Payment Method as “primary”, EarthLink has the right to use any other Payment Method, if payment does not clear through the primary Payment Method for any reason, including without limitation, a problem with my Payment Method itself, a problem with EarthLink’s payment processing system, or any other reason whatsoever. I understand that the forgoing states EarthLink’s long-standing policy and practice.

UNAVAILABILITY OR INSUFFICIENT FUNDS
------------------------------------

If a payment is not honored or is returned for any reason, including for insufficient funds, I understand that EarthLink may terminate my Automatic Payments Authorization and I will be responsible for making alternative payment arrangements. EarthLink is not liable for any fees assessed by my bank or card issuer in connection with my use of my designated Payment Method (such as an insufficient funds, over-limit or overdraft fees). I understand that I am still responsible for the timely payment of the related invoice, any fees applied by my bank or card issuer, and any returned item fees charged by EarthLink.

REVOKING MY AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS AUTHORIZATION
--------------------------------------------

I acknowledge that this Automatic Payments Authorization for recurring electronic payments will remain in full force and effect until I notify EarthLink that I want to revoke this authorization by (i) changing my billing method under “My Account” at [myaccount.earthlink.net](https://myaccount.earthlink.net/), or (ii) mailing a written statement expressly revoking this authorization to EarthLink Customer Service, 980 Hammond Drive NE Suite 400, Atlanta, Georgia 30328. I understand that EarthLink requires at least three (3) business days before the scheduled payment due date shown on my billing statement to discontinue my Automatic Payments Authorization. I acknowledge that if my cancellation request is submitted after this time, the cancellation may not take effect until the following billing cycle for my billing statement.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER REVOCATION OR CANCELLATION
---------------------------------------------

Upon the revocation or cancellation of my Automatic Payments Authorization, my bill payment method will automatically revert to “Pay by Check” unless I specify an alternative bill payment method under “My Account” at [myaccount.earthlink.net](https://myaccount.earthlink.net/). If I allow my bill payment method to revert to “Pay by Check,” I understand that EarthLink will charge a processing fee each time I pay my billing invoice. In order to avoid this processing fee, I must select an alternate bill payment method under “My Account” before the end of the billing cycle associated with the revocation or cancellation of my Automatic Payments Authorization.

Note to you from EarthLink
--------------------------

It is recommended that you print a copy of this Automatic Payments Authorization and maintain it for your records. Earthlink reserves the right to change these terms or terminate this Automatic Payments Authorization at any time. These terms do not in any way terminate, amend or modify other terms, agreements or policies that apply to your EarthLink account or any EarthLink services you receive or other agreements you may have with EarthLink.
