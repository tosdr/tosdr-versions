Tenor Terms of Service
======================

[Terms of Service](https://tenor.com/legal-terms) · [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)

  

### Last Updated: March 3, 2021

Tenor includes the Tenor mobile app, Tenor’s website, located at http://tenor.com, the Tenor extensions, and the Tenor API. The Tenor API may be integrated with third party devices or services, but any Tenor related services are provided by Google.

To use Tenor, you must accept (1) the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en) and (2) these Tenor Additional Terms of Service (the "**Tenor Additional Terms**").

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the "**Terms**". They establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.

If these Tenor Additional Terms conflict with the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en), these Additional Terms will govern for Tenor.

Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://account.google.com/).

**1.****Your Content.**

Tenor allows you to submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. Your content is licensed to Google as described in the Google Terms of Service — so if you upload content to Tenor, we may display that content to users and share it when directed, and those users (including users who access content through the Tenor API) may view, share, and modify that content.

**2.****Prohibited Content.**

2.1You must not use Tenor for any commercial purpose or for the benefit of any third party.

2.2As we explain in the Google Terms of Service, we want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone. When using Tenor, you must follow our [Program Policies](https://support.google.com/tenor) and the basic rules of conduct described in the Google Terms of Services. In particular, when using Tenor, you must not:

a.submit, store, send, or share any content that:

i.violates, or encourages any conduct that would violate applicable law or others’ rights, including any content that infringes, misappropriates, or violates someone else’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy;

ii.contains personal or contact information about any other person without their prior authorization;

iii.promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances;

iv.is fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive;

v.is false or defamatory;

vi.is obscene or pornographic;

vii.promotes or constitutes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment, or harm against any individual or group;

viii.is violent or threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any individual, group, or organization; or

b.send any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or communications, including email, mail, spam, chain letters, or other solicitations.

2.3

Any content assessed as inappropriate, illegal, or incompatible may be restricted or removed. We use a combination of systems to identify and assess content generated by or uploaded into our services that violates our policies, such as these terms, Google [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), or that violates the law. However, we understand that we sometimes make mistakes. If you think your content doesn’t violate these terms or was removed in error, you can appeal.

You may be restricted from using our service, or have your account suspended or terminated if:

* you materially or repeatedly breach these terms;
* we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order;
* We reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, a third-party, or Tenor - for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you or you have submitted, stored, shared, or send any Prohibited Content.

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center [article](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?sjid=7465486218302094232-NA). If you believe your Tenor Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can [appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?sjid=7465486218302094232-NA).
