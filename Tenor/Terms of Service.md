### Last Updated: March 3, 2021

Tenor includes the Tenor mobile app, Tenor’s website, located at http://tenor.com, the Tenor extensions, and the Tenor API. The Tenor API may be integrated with third party devices or services, but any Tenor related services are provided by Google.

To use Tenor, you must accept (1) the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en) and (2) these Tenor Additional Terms of Service (the "**Tenor Additional Terms**").

Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the "**Terms**". They establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.

If these Tenor Additional Terms conflict with the [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en), these Additional Terms will govern for Tenor.

Although it’s not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read our [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://account.google.com/).
