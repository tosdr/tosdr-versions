Privacy Policy
==============

**The National Domestic Violence Hotline – Digital Services** is the organization which provides all advocacy services on [www.thehotline.org](https://www.thehotline.org/) and through 24-hour telephone services at 1-800-799-7233.

Anonymous Digital Service is defined as a one-time confidential contact between a user and advocate in which no identifying information is verified.

**The Hotline Provides Digital Services**

Engaging in our digital services constitutes an agreement and understanding of privacy policy. Digital services are defined as web based chat, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, The Hotline blog or any Hotline website or web-based comment section. If at any time, a digital service user feels that their safety or privacy may be compromised due their use of these services, the interaction can be escalated to phone-based services.

**Opt-Out Policy**

The Hotline gives users options for non-digital services when necessary and practical. Such choices include opting not to engage in digital services and opting not to provide identifiable information during interactions with advocates. Users concerned for their physical safety and well-being are encouraged to contact The Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.

**Confidential and Anonymous Chat**

Our live chat services are provided by Caspio as a service (SaaS) provider. Chat users are asked to enter their name and other personal information to facilitate service with an operator. IP addresses are also required to facilitate a connection. Information collected from a user on a voluntary basis can include:

* Organization name
* Gender
* Age
* City
* State
* Zip
* How user-heard about the service

The National Domestic Violence Hotline collects limited demographic and geo-locational information in order to provide services. The National Domestic Violence Hotline defines anonymous communication as a onetime individual contact where digital services are provided between a chatter and advocate in which no information is collected that can connect the user to the individual service interaction. Dialogue transcripts of chats are purged regularly. Any information that is temporarily maintained is core to our evaluation of services provided to persons contacting the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Identifying information is in no way cross-verified. A chat user’s information, including any personally identifiable information, will only be shared with persons implicitly linked to The Hotline’s operations. We do not sell, trade or rent personal information that chat users provide. All advocates, including volunteers, are required to sign a client confidentiality policy. After any chat or email session, persons contacting The Hotline may be asked to fill out an exit survey in order to provide valuable feedback about our service. Providing information in an exit survey is completely voluntary. Surveys may ask for contact information (e.g., email address) and for demographic information (e.g., zip code, age or income level).

**Text/SMS Messaging Services**

The Hotline offers services through a text message short code in which all inbound phone-numbers are scrambled. These services include:

* Text-for-help services: The same privacy standards applied to our chat services apply to our text-for-help platform. Any statement of charges or billing will appear as a text message sent to Waterfall, based in Austin, and is in no way connected to The Hotline. Users may be asked to provide voluntary feedback to survey questions.
* Opt-in newsletter/updates: Users can opt-in to receive regular messages providing updates relevant issue-related content. Users can opt-out any time. While numbers may be  scrambled, but users may provide voluntary feedback to survey questions.
* One-time information messages: These are one-time messages are sent to a user to inform the user of specific issue content. The user has the option to learn more on follow-up page. No further communication will occur unless prompted by the user. The Hotline will not provide crisis services in this type of interaction.

Users can opt-out of services by texting ‘STOP’ to our shortcode any time. Users can get help by texting ‘HELP’ to our shortcode any time. Message and data rates may apply. Users will be charged standard text messaging rates relative to their provider’s plans. Carriers are not liable for the delayed or undelivered messages. Message frequency may vary. Users should be aware and mindful that text messages sent using modern smart phones are saved indefinitely and could compromise their safety. Users concerned for their physical safety and well-being are encouraged to contact The Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.

**Software as a Service and Application Service Providers (3rd party)**

The Hotline will undertake an annual review of any third party privacy policies affecting Hotline services. The Hotline is not responsible for changes or updates made in the interim.
