DISCLOSURES

When inquiring about a loan on this site, this is not a loan application. This is not an offer to lend and we are not affiliated with your current mortgage servicer. Upon the completion of your inquiry, we will work hard to match you with a lender or lenders who may assist you with an official loan application and provide loan product eligibility requirements for your individual situation.

When applying for a loan, lenders will commonly require you to provide a valid social security number and submit to a credit check. Consumers who do not have the minimum acceptable credit required by the lender are unlikely to be approved. Minimum credit ratings may vary according to lender and loan product. In the event that you do not qualify for a credit rating based on the required minimum credit rating, a lender may or may not introduce you to a credit counseling service or credit improvement company who may or may not be able to assist you with improving your credit for a fee. Any loan product that a lender may offer you will carry fees or costs including closing costs, origination points, and/or refinancing fees. In many instances, fees or costs can amount to several thousand dollars and can be due upon the origination of the loan product.
