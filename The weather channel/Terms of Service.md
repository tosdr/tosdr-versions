If you do not agree to this TWC Subscriber Agreement, you may not use any of the subscription offerings for TWC’s weather.com website. This TWC Subscriber Agreement incorporates these Terms of Use (“TWC Terms of Use”), and your agreement to this TWC Subscriber Agreement also constitutes your agreement to the TWC Terms of Use. The WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service subscription, the WEATHER.COM AD FREE service subscription, and any other subscription offerings for TWC's weather.com website constitute "Services" as defined under the TWC Terms of Use. If any terms or conditions in this TWC Subscriber Agreement conflict with any terms or conditions in the TWC Terms of Use, the terms or conditions in this TWC Subscriber Agreement will control. Additionally, your agreement to this TWC Subscriber Agreement constitutes your acknowledgement of the TWC Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) located at [https://weather.com/en-US/twc/privacy-policy](https://weather.com/en-US/twc/privacy-policy)

ii. The WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service and the WEATHER.COM AD FREE service are available only in the U.S.A. By subscribing to the WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service or the WEATHER.COM AD FREE service, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age or older.

**B. Subscription and Auto-Renewal. Your subscription to the WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service, the WEATHER.COM AD FREE service or any other subscription offerings for TWC’s weather.com website is provided for a specific billing period such as monthly or yearly, and unless otherwise noted in the terms of your offer, your subscription will continue and automatically renew at the end of the billing period you choose, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. Payment for the first billing period in the amount shown to you at the time of purchase (plus applicable taxes) will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase, and because your subscription automatically renews, payment for each additional billing period (plus applicable taxes) will then be charged at the start of each additional billing period, unless you cancel your subscription. For subscriptions with a yearly billing period or longer, we will notify you of the pending renewal of your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the date your subscription renews, except as otherwise required by law. Unless we notify you in advance of a price change as further described below, the renewal rate for each additional billing period will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior billing period unless you received promotional or discount pricing as disclosed to you as part of a specific offer (for example, offers for a discounted first month or first year rate). At any time, you can stop your subscription from renewing for an additional billing period after the then-current billing period by canceling your subscription as described below.**

**C. Cancellation. You may cancel the renewal of your WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service subscription, WEATHER.COM AD FREE service subscription or any other subscription offerings for TWC’s weather.com website at any time at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period or free trial, and the cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period or free trial. If you cancel, your subscription will not renew for an additional billing period. Please note that you will not receive a prorated refund of charges for the current billing period, but you will continue to have access to the service through the end of the current billing period (through the end of the month, for a monthly subscription, or year, for an annual subscription). To cancel, you may log in to your account at www.weather.com, select My Account, select Manage Subscription, and follow the prompts to cancel or you may email TWC Customer Support at [subscriptions@weather.com](mailto:subscriptions@weather.com) indicating your choice to cancel. If you purchased your WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service subscription, WEATHER.COM AD FREE service subscription or any other subscription offering for TWC’s weather.com website via a third party, please follow the cancellation instructions set out by the applicable third party.**

**D. Price Changes. We reserve the right to change the price of your subscription for billing periods after your then-current billing period. In the event of a price change, we will provide reasonable notice to you before the price change, such as by emailing you or by providing notice when you visit weather.com, as required by law. If you do not wish to agree to the changed price for future billing periods, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with the instructions for cancellation above. If you do not cancel your subscription after notice of the price change and prior to the start of your new billing period, your subscription will be renewed at the price in effect at the time of the renewal, without any additional action by you, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for the new price (plus applicable taxes).**

E. Payment Methods; Billing. TWC uses a third party payment processor (“Payment Processor”) to bill the payment method you provide upon purchase. TWC may accept various forms of payment for subscriptions. The terms of your payment will be based on your payment method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method. By submitting an order to purchase a subscription to the WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service, the WEATHER.COM AD FREE service or any other subscription offerings for TWC’s weather.com website, you authorize TWC, or its Payment Processor, to charge your specified account for the purchase amount and to share any payment information and instructions required to complete the payment transactions (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services) with the Payment Processor. Processing of your payments is subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. TWC is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.

F. Free Trials. From time to time in our discretion, we may offer free trials allowing you to enjoy a WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service subscription for a period of time at no charge. With a free trial offer, you provide a payment method and authorize us to charge the subscription price (plus applicable taxes) to your payment method and begin your paid subscription if you do not cancel (according to the instructions for cancellation above) before the free trial ends. You can cancel the subscription without incurring any charges any time up until 24 hours before the end of your free trial. Unless otherwise required by law, you will not receive a notice that your free trial is about to end or has ended, or that your paid subscription has begun. Availability of a free trial is not guaranteed and, if available, may only be available to those who have not previously accepted a free trial offer for the WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service, at our discretion.

G. Subscription Options. From time to time, we may offer different subscription options, including subscriptions to third-party products and services or subscription bundles that include subscriptions offered by TWC along with those offered by third parties. If you choose to purchase such offerings, you agree that we may charge your payment method on file for any included third-party products and services.

H. Refund Policy. All subscriptions are non-refundable unless otherwise required by law. We do not provide refunds or credits, including for partially used billing periods, such as in the event that you decide to delete your weather.com account, which would prevent you from being able to sign in and access the WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service, the WEATHER.COM AD FREE service or any other subscription offerings for TWC’s weather.com website. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period (through the end of the month, for a monthly subscription, or year, for an annual subscription), but your subscription will not renew for an additional billing period.

I. Service Limitations. The number of simultaneous logged in sessions of the WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service or WEATHER.COM AD FREE service under your account is currently limited to three (3) sessions. We reserve the right to disable use of your subscription if we notice excessive sessions or other unusual activity using your account. The number of simultaneous sessions available for use may change from time to time at our discretion.

J. Subscriptions Obtained Through Third Parties. If you subscribe to the WEATHER.COM PREMIUM PRO service, WEATHER.COM AD FREE service or any other subscription offerings for TWC’s weather.com website through a third party, your subscription is subject to any terms and conditions provided to you by that third party. Accordingly, the terms and conditions in this TWC Subscriber Agreement concerning purchase, billing, cancellation, or refunds do not apply to your subscription to the extent this TWC Subscriber Agreement conflicts with the applicable third party’s terms and conditions. Your billing relationship is with the third party, so any inquiries regarding purchase, billing, cancellation or refunds should be directed to the third party. To cancel a subscription obtained via a third party, you must follow the cancellation instructions provided by the third party.

K. Changes to Subscriber Agreement. TWC may modify the terms and conditions of this TWC Subscriber Agreement in its discretion. TWC will notify you of significant modifications by email or by providing notice on the weather.com website. Modifications shall be effective immediately; provided however, for existing subscribers, such revisions shall, unless otherwise stated, be effective thirty (30) days after notice has been provided to you.

You acknowledge and agree that TWC may share your email address, name, and other personal information (excluding your payment information, such as your credit card number) that you provide to TWC during the purchase of your Subscription Bundle with the corresponding Third Party Provider, and that the Third Party Provider may process such personal information as disclosed in the Third Party Provider's privacy policy.

D. Changes to This Agreement. TWC may modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement in its discretion. TWC will notify you of significant modifications by email. Modifications shall be effective immediately; provided however, for existing subscribers, such revisions shall, unless otherwise stated, be effective thirty (30) days after notice has been provided to you.

E. Eligibility to Purchase; Existing Subscribers. Subscription Bundles are offered for sale to and may be purchased by U.S. residents only. If you currently subscribe to a TWC Subscription or a Third Party Subscription, your unexpired individual subscription cannot be converted to or replaced by a bundled subscription upon purchase of a Subscription Bundle. Unless you intend to have and pay for two separate, current TWC Subscriptions (or two separate, current Third Party Subscriptions, as applicable), you should first cancel the renewal of your unexpired individual subscription and only purchase a Subscription Bundle after your unexpired individual subscription has expired. Note that it is not possible to have two separate subscriptions for the same TWC Subscription Service under a single TWC account (whether individually purchased or purchased as part of a Subscription Bundle). The same may also be the case for Third Party Subscriptions, and you should contact the relevant Third Party Provider for more information.

**F. Subscription and Auto-Renewal. Your Subscription Bundle, and the individual subscriptions that are included, are provided for a specific billing period such as monthly or yearly, and unless otherwise noted in the terms of your offer, your Subscription Bundle, will continue and automatically renew at the end of the billing period you choose, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. Payment for the first billing period in the amount shown to you at the time of purchase (plus applicable taxes) will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase, and because your Subscription Bundle automatically renews, payment for each additional billing period (plus applicable taxes) will then be charged at the start of each additional billing period, unless you cancel your Subscription Bundle. For Subscription Bundles with a yearly billing period or longer, we will notify you of the pending renewal of your Subscription Bundle at least thirty (30) days prior to the date your Subscription Bundle renews, except as otherwise required by law. Unless we notify you in advance of a price change as further described below, the renewal rate for each additional billing period will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior billing period unless you received promotional or discount pricing as disclosed to you as part of a specific offer (for example, offers for a discounted first month or first year rate).  At any time at least 24 hours before the current period of your Subscription Bundle ends, you can stop your Subscription Bundle from renewing for an additional billing period after the then-current billing period by canceling your Subscription Bundle as described below.**

**G. Single Purchase; Identical Subscription Periods. You acknowledge and agree that:**

* **Because you are purchasing two or more subscriptions in a single transaction for a single price, the individual subscriptions in your Subscription Bundle have identical subscription periods, which means that the individual subscriptions must begin and end together (whether through expiration or termination for any reason);**
* **If you would like to discontinue one subscription in your Subscription Bundle but not others, you must cancel the renewal of the entire Subscription Bundle (by following the instructions in the "Cancellation" section) and then separately purchase (through subscription providers of your choice) any subscriptions that you would like to continue to have. Before cancelling, ensure that you are familiar with the refund policies in the "Refund Policy" section.**

**H. Cancellation. You may cancel the renewal of your Subscription Bundle at any time at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period or free trial, and the cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period or free trial. If you cancel, your Subscription Bundle will not renew for an additional billing period. Please note that you will not receive a prorated refund of charges for the current billing period, but you will continue to have access to the subscribed products and/or services through the end of the current billing period (through the end of the month, for a monthly subscription, or year, for an annual subscription). To cancel, you may log in to your account at www.weather.com, select My Account, select Manage Subscription, and follow the prompts to cancel or you may email TWC Customer Support at subscriptions@weather.com indicating your choice to cancel.**

**I. Price Changes. We reserve the right to change the price of your Subscription Bundle for billing periods after your then-current billing period. In the event of a price change, we will provide reasonable notice to you before the price change, such as by emailing you or by providing notice when you visit weather.com or open the applicable mobile application, as required by law. If you do not wish to agree to the changed price for future billing periods, you may cancel your Subscription Bundle in accordance with the instructions for cancellation above. If you do not cancel your Subscription Bundle after notice of the price change and prior to the start of your new billing period, your Subscription Bundle will be renewed at the price in effect at the time of the renewal, without any additional action by you, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for the new price (plus applicable taxes).**

J. Payment Methods; Billing. TWC uses a third party payment processor (“Payment Processor”) to bill the payment method you provide upon purchase. TWC may accept various forms of payment for subscriptions. The terms of your payment will be based on your payment method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method. By submitting an order to purchase a Subscription Bundle, you authorize TWC, or its Payment Processor, to charge your specified account for the purchase amount and to share any payment information and instructions required to complete the payment transactions (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services) with the Payment Processor. Processing of your payments is subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. TWC is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.

K. Free Trials. From time to time in our discretion, we may offer free trials allowing you to enjoy subscriptions for a period of time at no charge. With a free trial offer, you provide a payment method and authorize us to charge the subscription price (plus applicable taxes) to your payment method and begin your paid subscription if you do not cancel (according to the instructions for cancellation above) before the free trial ends. You can cancel the subscription without incurring any charges any time before the end of your free trial. Unless otherwise required by law, you will not receive a notice that your free trial is about to end or has ended, or that your paid subscription has begun. Availability of a free trial is not guaranteed and, if available, may only be available to those who have not previously accepted a free trial offer, at our discretion.

L. Refund Policy. All Subscription Bundles and the included subscriptions are non-refundable unless otherwise required by law. We do not provide refunds or credits, including for partially used billing periods, such as in the event that you decide to delete your account, which would prevent you from being able to sign in and manage your subscriptions. If you cancel the renewal of your Subscription Bundle, as long as you do not delete your account, you will continue to have access to the subscribed products and/or services through the end of your current billing period (e.g., through the end of the month, for a monthly subscription, or year, for an annual subscription), but your subscription will not renew for an additional billing period.

M. When To Contact TWC and When To Contact Third Party Providers. **Because you are purchasing your Third Party Subscription(s) through TWC, your _billing_ relationship is with TWC and not Third Party Providers, so any inquiries regarding purchase, billing, cancellation, renewals or refunds must be directed to TWC. To cancel the renewal of a Third Party Subscription purchased from TWC (which may only be done by canceling the renewal of the Subscription Bundle as a whole), you must follow the cancellation instructions provided by TWC**. While you should contact TWC in connection with any issues regarding your billing relationship, please contact the Third Party Provider's customer support regarding the operation, content, features and functionality provided under your Third Party Subscription, including any technical support issues.

N. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. SUBSCRIPTION BUNDLES ARE SOLD BY TWC ON AN "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TWC MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU PURSUANT TO ANY THIRD PARTY SUBSCRIPTION INCLUDED IN THE SUBSCRIPTION BUNDLE. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, TWC DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU PURSUANT TO ANY THIRD PARTY SUBSCRIPTION.

O. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEITHER TWC NOR ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS, DISTRIBUTORS OR LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, “COVERED PARTIES”) WILL BE LIABLE IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, UNDER A NEGLIGENCE THEORY, OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY), FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY LOSS, LIABILITY, DAMAGE OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER LOSSES (EVEN IF REPLACEMENT OR A REFUND FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION BUNDLE DOES NOT FULLY COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES AND EVEN IF COVERED PARTIES KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES), DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS SUBSCRIPTION BUNDLE AGREEMENT OR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION BUNDLE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TWC'S NOR ANY OTHER COVERED PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TWC’S OWN NEGLIGENCE) OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STRICT LIABILITY) EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO TWC, IF ANY, FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION BUNDLE.

P. EXCEPTIONS TO DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LIABILITY. ACCORDINGLY, THOSE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT WHICH ARE CONTRARY TO OR ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU AND DO NOT AFFECT ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS AVAILABLE TO YOU WHICH MAY NOT BE DISCLAIMED OR LIMITED; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE REMAINING DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND THE REMAINDER OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE.

Q. Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of TWC, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and, to the extent of their rights, for the benefit of Third Party Providers and other Covered Parties, and each of the foregoing will have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or on its own behalf as applicable as if it were a party to this Agreement.

R. Miscellaneous. This Subscription Bundle Purchase Agreement, including any other agreements or documents expressly incorporated herein, constitutes the entire agreement between TWC and you regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements regarding the subject matter. If any terms or conditions of this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions will not be in any way affected or impaired. No waiver by TWC of any breach or default under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of New York, U.S.A. without regard to its conflicts of law principles. All disputes under this Agreement will be resolved by the Supreme Court of the State of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and each party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and hereby waives any jurisdictional or venue defenses otherwise available to it. All notices contemplated by this Agreement will be in writing. TWC may provide notice to you through the Services or via email in TWC's discretion or where required by law. All notices to TWC should be addressed to The Weather Company, LLC, 1001 Summit Boulevard, 21st Floor, Atlanta, GA 30319, U.S.A., attention of Legal Department.
