Website cookie policy
=====================

Why this website uses cookies – and what this means for you.
------------------------------------------------------------

Like most websites today, our website uses what are known as 'cookies'. Our cookies are not sinister - they are simply small files, placed on your computer by your browser, to help us provide a better service. We do this to help us understand things such as how many people visit the various parts of our website.

Our cookies do not identify you personally. If we need to do this (such as when asking you to sign up for a newsletter) we are always upfront about it. We make it clear not onlywhenwe collect personal information but also what we intend to do with it.

We occasionally use cookies when we are running a website-based survey. Such cookies perform no other function other than to ensure that requests for information are not repeated after you have either participated or declined to participate.

### Why do I have to agree to the use of cookies?

You don't - you can agree or you can opt out. All websites within the UK now have to comply with a new 'cookie law' (an update to the UK's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations) - this means we now have to tell you that our website uses cookies and provide a mechanism for you to opt out of their use. You'll see this notice at the foot of every page, until you agree - at which point the notice disappears.

### You can control cookies using your browser

Typically, your Web browser software will allow you to control cookies through its settings. For details on how to do this, please refer to the browser's help files or the manufacturer's support pages.

### Google Analytics

Our website uses Google Analytics for tracking and reporting of site performance. This does not personally identify you - it just helps us understand which parts of our website people like the most. [You can opt out here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
