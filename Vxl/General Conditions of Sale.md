Terms and warranty
==================

VXL Instruments (VXL) warrants VXL hardware products to be free of material hardware defects with the following terms and conditions from the date of purchase by the original purchaser.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date of purchase to be determined by a valid proof of purchase which must be machine printed and include: 

* Name of reseller
* Date of purchase
* Model numbers of products purchased
* Serial numbers of products purchased 

All VXL desktop thin clients and zero clients (Vtona and Xtona) are backed by a three-year (3) limited RTB warranty. Any other models or accessories specifically listed on the product information datasheet or price list, the warranty is limited to one year only.

VXL will, at its option, repair or replace any such defect according to the terms of this warranty. VXL’s liability under this warranty shall be limited to repair or replacement. VXL warrants only the base unit desktop thin clients for the three years. Any other models, keyboards, mice and related accessories, are only warranted for the first twelve months from the original date of shipment.

Monitors or any external options sold by VXL are warranted directly by and through the monitor or options manufacturers, not by VXL, and VXL shall have no responsibility or liability therefore. Under this warranty, VXL will, at VXL’s option, repair or replace defective hardware products and related hardware components, during VXL’s normal working hours.

VXL will not ship replacement equipment until the defective hardware or hardware component is received (freight prepaid by the purchaser) at the VXL factory or service depot, unless VXL agrees in writing to do otherwise. VXL, at its option, may ship the replacement hardware product prior to its receipt of the defective hardware product. The model and serial number of the defective hardware product must be furnished by the purchaser at the time of request for service under this warranty. An RMA must be obtained from the VXL service department prior to returning the hardware to the factory.

To invoke the VXL warranty procedure, contact your local service centre below to describe the nature of the fault and, if appropriate, obtain an RMA number. Pack the unit in the original packaging or equivalent, with the RMA number clearly visible. Ensure that all shipping costs are paid and that insurance cover is obtained to cover the cost of the unit in transit. VXL will assume liability for the unit only upon signed delivery at the service centre. 

If you have bought a used or modified VXL thin client (outside the warranty period) at an Internet auction or similar, VXL cannot guarantee first and second level support. In such cases you should contact the seller of the device directly. For warranty reasons VXL does not provide instructions nor support for the technical handling of your products above and beyond the defined product characteristics.

### VXL extended standard warranty

VXL offers the choice of an optional limited warranty extension for up to either four or five years, in addition to the standard three years’ limited warranty for certain equipment.

For full terms and conditions for the VXL extended standard warranty, please refer to the same terms and conditions as detailed in the above standard warranty policy. Please note that in order to qualify for extended warranty cover, the extended warranty policy must be purchased at the same time as the VXL thin-client devices.

This warranty shall be invalid if, in VXL’s sole judgment, the hardware product or component has been subjected to misuse, abuse, neglect, accident, acts of God, external electrical fault, power surges or failure, damage occurred in shipment, acts outside the reasonable control of VXL or its distributors and resellers, or from improper service or modification by anyone other than a VXL-authorised service centre. The warranty shall also be invalid if the hardware product’s serial number has been removed, defaced or altered in any way. This warranty does not cover other manufacturers’ computer hardware, components, accessories or expansion items unless authorised in writing by VXL.

The sole and exclusive remedy to the purchaser, under this warranty, shall be the repair or replacement of defective parts as provided above. 

### DOA (dead on arrival) policy 

VXL treats all failures due to a material or workmanship problem within the first seven days following dispatch as DOA (dead on arrival). The customer must report and return the DOA unit within seven days of receipt of the RMA number.

### Software warranty limitation

VXL is a manufacturer of hardware products and therefore does not provide any warranty on software that may be included with the hardware or embedded in it, unless it has been specifically manufactured by our company. The software included in any product and not originally manufactured by us is sold as-is and carries no warranty from VXL. 

This warranty gives you the user specific legal rights that may vary from state to state and country to country, or jurisdiction to jurisdiction. VXL's responsibilities for malfunctions and defects in the hardware are limited to repair and/or replacement as stated in this warranty document. All express and implied warranties for the product including but not limited to any implied warranties of and conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are limited in duration to the warranty period as set forth within this warranty document and no warranties whether express or implied will apply after such period. Some states, countries and jurisdictions may not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts and if you should qualify for such an exemption such limitations will not apply to you.

VXL accepts no liability beyond the remedies set forth in this warranty document nor liability for incidental or consequential damages including without limitation any liability for products not being available for use or for lost data or for software. Some states, countries and jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion nor limitation of incidental or consequential damages and if you should qualify for such an exemption such exclusion or limitation may not apply to you.

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, under no circumstances shall VXL, its successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees and agents, under any legal theory, tort, contract or otherwise, be liable in any way for damages hereunder, including, but not limited to, any loss or inaccuracy of data, business loss or profits, or any other direct or indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages arising from the use of the product covered by this warranty. In no event will VXL, its successors, assigns, officers, agents, or employees be liable to any party for any damages in excess of the amount such party paid to VXL for the purchase of the hardware products hereunder, even if VXL has been informed of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other such party. 

### Limited lifetime customer hardware support
