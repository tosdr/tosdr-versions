Among other things, cookies help us evaluate what parts of our websites are useful and which need improvement.

2. What Types of Cookies Do We Use?
-----------------------------------

The main types of cookies we use on our websites are:

* **Strictly Necessary cookies** allow the technical operation of our websites or apps (e.g., cookies that enable you to navigate a website or app, and to use its features). Some may also increase the usability of our websites or apps by remembering your choices. You may be able to disable some or all necessary cookies by adjusting your browser settings.

3\. First Party and Third Party Cookies
---------------------------------------

Cookies can be set by the operator of the websites you visit or by third parties that may or may not have a relationship with that operator. First party cookies are set by the operator to gather information for use by the operator. For example, we set first party cookies that help us evaluate whether our websites are performing as intended. In addition to cookies which send information to us, our websites also use cookies which collect information and send it to third parties. These are third party cookies and are set by an external organisation. An example of this is Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to help collect and compile information like the number of visitors to our site, where visitors have come to the site from and the pages they visited. Visit Google’s site for an [overview of privacy at Google](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) and information on [how to opt out of the Google Analytics cookie](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en-GB). We also use certain Microsoft advertising features such as Universal Event Tracking to assist with our online marketing efforts. Please read the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) for information about Microsoft’s privacy practices.

Where this site allows third party cookies to be set or you access other websites from our site using the links provided, please note that these websites will use cookies in accordance with their own cookies policy which may differ from ours.

You may be able to block first and third-party cookies through your browser settings.
