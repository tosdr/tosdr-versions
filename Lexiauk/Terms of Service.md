Accordingly, save as set out in condition 13.1 above, Lexia gives no warranties and can accept no liability in relation to the Publisher Products whatsoever, including in relation to their availability or performance. The Customer agrees that in so far as it requires warranties and/or guarantees in respect of the Publisher Products, the Customer must rely on its rights under the Publisher Licence Terms.

14. **Limitation of Liability**

14.1. This condition 14 sets out the entire financial liability of Lexia (including any liability for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, consultants, and subcontractors) to the Customer in respect of any breach of the Contract, any use made by the Customer of the Lexia Services or Publisher Products or any part of them and any representation, statement or tortious act or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with the Contract.

14.2. Nothing in these terms and conditions limits or excludes the liability of Lexia for death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any damage or liability incurred by the Customer as a result of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by Lexia.

14.3. Subject to condition 14.2, Lexia shall not be liable for:

14.3.1. loss of profits, loss of business, depletion of goodwill, loss of anticipated savings, or loss of contract; or

14.3.2. loss of corruption of data or information; or

14.3.3. any special, indirect, consequential or pure economic loss, costs, damages, charges or expenses.

14.4. Subject to condition 14.2, Lexia’s total liability in contract, tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise arising in connection with the performance, or contemplated performance, of the Contract shall be limited to the price paid by the Customer to Lexia for the Publisher Products and Lexia Services in the 12 months immediately preceding the event (or last in a series of events) giving rise to the liability.

15. **Term and Termination**

15.1. This Contract shall come into force upon acceptance of Lexia’s Quotation in accordance with condition 2.1 or such other date as may be specified in the Quotation. Subject to condition 15.3 the Contract shall continue in force until such time as there are no Publisher Products and Publisher Services being provided by Lexia (“**Term**“).

15.2. Each element of the Publisher Products and Lexia Services shall be provided for its respective Initial Period, and thereafter shall continue to be provided on an automatic renewal basis for each successive Renewal Period, unless either party notifies the other party of termination of the relevant Publisher Products or Lexia Services, in writing, at least 60 days before the end of the Initial Period or Renewal Term. In the event of such notice, this shall not affect the Contract in respect of Publisher Products and Lexia Services not terminated pursuant to that notice.

15.3. Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which Lexia may have, Lexia may terminate the Contract with immediate effect, without liability to the Customer on giving the Customer written notice if:

15.3.1. the Customer fails to pay any amount due under the Contract on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than seven days after being notified in writing to make such payment; or

15.3.2. the Customer commits a breach of any of the terms of the Contract and (if such a breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within 30 days of being notified in writing of the breach; or

15.3.3. the Customer repeatedly breaches any of the terms of the Contract in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of the Contract; or

15.3.4. the Customer is involved in any legal proceedings concerning its solvency, or ceases trading, or commits an act of bankruptcy or is adjudicated bankrupt, or enters into liquidation (whether compulsory or voluntary) or makes any arrangement with its creditors or petitions for an

administration order or has a receiver or manager or administrator appointed over all or part of its assets or generally becomes unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or suffers any similar or analogous event to any of the foregoing in any jurisdiction in consequence of debt;

15.3.5. the Customer’s licence to use the Publisher Products is terminated or expires for any reason; or

15.3.6. Lexia’s right to re-sell Publisher Products or to provide the Lexia Services, ceases for whatever reason.

15.4. On termination of the Contract for any reason the accrued rights and liabilities of the parties as at termination and the continuation of any provision expressly stated to survive or implicitly surviving termination, shall not be affected.

16. **Consequences of Termination**

In the event that the Customer’s licence to use the Publisher’s Products is terminated for whatever reason, the Customer shall not be entitled to a refund of any charges paid to Lexia, and in addition shall be required to pay all charges due pursuant to condition 8, and provided that to the extent that such charges have not yet become due pursuant to the Quotation, all such charges shall become immediately due and payable on termination. In circumstances where the Customer’s licence is terminated other than due to the Customer’s default, then Lexia may, at its sole discretion, agree in writing to a pro-rata reduction to the amount of charges payable.

17. **Miscellaneous**

17.1. Lexia shall have no liability to the Customer under the Contract if it is prevented from, or delayed in performing, its obligations under the Contract or from carrying on its business by acts, events, omissions or accidents beyond its reasonable control, including (without limitation) strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes, failure of a utility service or transport network, act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation or direction, accident, breakdown of plant or machinery, fire, flood, storm or default of suppliers or subcontractors.

17.2. Subject to condition 6.5, no variation of the Contract or these terms and conditions shall be valid unless agreed in writing between the parties.

17.3. A waiver of any right under the Contract is only effective if it is in writing and it applies only to the circumstances for which it is given. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right or remedy under the Contract or by law shall constitute a waiver of that (or any other) right or remedy, nor preclude or restrict its further exercise. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that (or any other) right or remedy.

17.4. If any provision of the Contract (or part of any provision) is found by any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed not to form part of the Contract, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of the Contract shall not be affected.

17.5. The Contract constitutes the whole agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter. Each party acknowledges that, in entering into the Contract, it has not relied on, and shall have no right or remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently) other than as expressly provided in the Contract.

17.6. The Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of Lexia, assign, transfer, charge, mortgage, subcontract or deal in any manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the Contract. Lexia may at any time assign, transfer, charge, mortgage, subcontract, or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights and obligations under the Contract.

17.7. Nothing in the Contract is intended to, or shall be deemed to, constitute a partnership or joint venture of any kind between any of the parties, nor constitute any party the agent of another party for any purpose. No party shall have authority to act as agent for, or to bind, the other party in any way.

17.8. A notice required or permitted to be given by either party to the other under these terms and conditions shall be in writing addressed to the other party at its registered office or principal place of business or such other address as may at the relevant time have been notified pursuant to this provision to the party giving the notice.

17.9. A person who is not a party to the Contract shall not have any rights under or in connection with it.

17.10. The Contract, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of England and Wales and the parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of, or in connection with, the Contract or its subject matter.
