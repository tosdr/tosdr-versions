DJG may use Providers to collect, store or access your personal information in connection with certain aspects of the Services and/or Product, however such Providers will be bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes, to sell it or to disclose it to others unless necessary to ensure proper function of the Services and/or Product. Except as described in these Terms of Use, we don't rent, sell or otherwise distribute to others any personal information collected in connection with the Services and/or Product, including to any third party for such third party's direct marketing purposes. The Services and/or Product do not collect personally identifiable information about an individual user's online activities across third party web sites (and thus do not monitor any applicable Do Not Track indicator).

### 2\. USAGE INFORMATION

The Services and/or Product of DJG and its Providers automatically record certain information about how a person uses the Services and/or Product (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, location, domain name, referring web page, device and browser type, operating system, device settings, the features of the Services and/or Product accessed and the time spent using those features, frequency with which the Services and/or Product are used by a user, search terms, the features and links on the Services and/or Product that a user clicked on or used, and other statistics. We use this information to administer and support the Services and/or Product and we analyze this information to improve and enhance the Services and tailor them to our users’ needs and preferences. We may use third party web analytics tools, including but not limited to Google® Analytics, Firebase, Kibana, and/or Crashlytics to collect and analyze Usage Information. Usage Information does not, in and of itself, identify you personally, but we may link it to personal information for account holders.

##### a. Services and/or Product Data

We may collect and record information relating to the setup, general performance, and operation of the Services and/or Product, including Services and/or Product status, User Content that a Services and/or Product’s sensors record (including audio, video, motion), and your Services and/or Product usage. We may store this data along with your personal information and other information about your use of the Services and/or Product. We use this information to allow you (and us) to monitor and operate the Services and/or Product

##### b. Location Data

The Services and/or Product may collect location information based on your IP address but do not collect precise GPS information about the location of your mobile device. We may associate this data with information associated with your account.

##### c. Cookies and Beacons

Usage Information may be collected via "cookies," which are small text files that are saved by your browser or device when you access the Services and/or Product. We (and our third-party providers, such as Google® Analytics) may use cookies to identify that you've logged in to the Services and/or Product and to tell us how and when you interact with the Services and/or Product. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing for the Services and/or Product and to customize and improve the Services and/or Product. Some apps and browsers have options to stop automatic acceptance of cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. You can also delete any cookie on your mobile device by uninstalling the mobile application. Please note, however, that if you don't permit cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services and/or Product. Software technology called tags or web beacons (a.k.a. pixel tags or clear gifs) may also be employed to help us better manage Services and/or Product content and communications by informing us how certain content or features are used. These beacons (or other tracking technology) may be included in or associated with e-mails or other communications that you receive from us (or our Provider). We may link data gathered by web beacons or other tracking technology to the personal information of account holders.

##### d. Push Notifications

You may sign up to receive “push notification” messages. To make sure messages reach the correct devices, our third party provider relies on a device token unique to your mobile device. A device token is a unique identifier issued to the app by the operating system of your mobile device. While we may be able to access a list of the tokens, neither the App nor the tokens will reveal your identity, your unique device ID, or your contact information to us. The third party provider may collect the following: the time of an event, how a User came to our site, what search engine and search keywords users may have used to get to our site, information about the device our user is on such as their Operating System, and browser, as well as the city, region and country location of users. This location information enables DJG to send public health push notification messages that are relevant to certain geographic locations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push notifications, simply adjust your phone settings or remove the App.

DJG and its affiliates may use aggregated or non-identifying data and Usage Information from the Services for analysis, technical, marketing or other business purposes and provide such aggregate or deidentified data to third parties for such purposes.

In your letter, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe that the DJG online Privacy Policy has not been followed.

### 14\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. To the fullest extent permitted by law, these Terms of Use, and any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief relating to these Terms or Use, the Services or Product, will be governed by the laws of Indiana, U.S.A., without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any dispute or claim relating to this Privacy Policy, the Services and/or Product will be resolved by binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), rather than in court (except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, and you or we may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to stop infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights). The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to the enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. This arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court (other than small claims court) rather than in arbitration you and DJG each waive any right to a jury trial and irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Columbus, Indiana in connection with any such action. You and DJG waive any objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue or forum non conveniens in any such action.

### 15\. EXPORT COMPLIANCE

Although the Services and/or Product may be accessible worldwide, our Services and/or Product are not designed for use in all countries, and some or all of the features of the Services and/or Product may not work or be appropriate for use in a particular country.

You agree to comply with the export laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions in providing and using the Services and/or Product. You will not permit anyone to access or use the Services and/or Product in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction.

### 17\. CONTINUITY

Please note that if DJG sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or DJG (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, DJG may provide to such entity customer and personal information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.

Specific elements of the Services and/or Product may include additional or different provisions relating to collection and disclosure of personal information. In the event of a conflict between such provisions and this Privacy Policy, such specific terms shall control.

### 18\. GENERAL

These Terms of Use, including any applicable Service Terms and other materials incorporated herein, represent the entire agreement and understanding relating to the use of the Services and prevail over any prior or contemporaneous, conflicting or additional communications. The English version of this Privacy Policy shall govern over any translation. You acknowledge and agree that each of DJG’s Providers, as well as Apple, Google and other applicable OS providers, shall be considered a third party beneficiary of these Terms of Use and shall have the right to enforce this Privacy Policy directly against you in connection with any dispute or breach.

Any unauthorized access, modification or change of any information, or any interference with the availability of or access to the Services is strictly prohibited. DJG reserves all legal rights and remedies available to it and this Privacy Policy shall in no way be deemed a limitation or waiver of any other rights DJG may have.

Our failure to assert a right or insist upon compliance with any term or condition shall not constitute a waiver of that right or excuse any subsequent noncompliance. If any provision of this Privacy Policy is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the remaining terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The parties agree that any invalid provision shall be deemed to be restated so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible under law consistent with the original intent and economic terms of the invalid provision.
