**JURISDICTION, CHOICE OF LAW AND DISPUTES**  
DJG controls and manages the Services from its facilities in the state of Indiana. Unless otherwise stated, materials and content on this website are presented solely for promoting products and services in the United States of America. Information around the Services and/or Product may not be announced or available in your country or region. We make no representation that such information, products, or services referenced are legal, available or appropriate in your country or region.

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to these terms of use, the Services, or the Product sold or distributed by or through DJG, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, and you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these terms of use. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). To the fullest extent permitted by law, we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and DJG irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Columbus, Indiana in connection with any action arising out of or related to these terms of use, this website, or any products or services sold or distributed by or through this website. You and DJG waive any objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue or forum non conveniens in any such action and each waive any right to a jury trial.
