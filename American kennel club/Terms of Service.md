Calls and text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other technology.

You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase with AKC. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary.

We do not charge for the service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with calls and text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Standard message and data rates may apply from your wireless provider. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to calls and SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.

You may opt-out of the service at any time. To unsubscribe from text messages and calls at any time, text STOP to 469-13 or reply STOP to any text message you receive from AKC. You consent that following such a request to unsubscribe, you may receive one final text message from AKC confirming your request. For help, text HELP to 469-13 or contact us at [info@akc.org](mailto:info@akc.org).

**11.  FEEDBACK**

**12.  YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT**
============================

In order to use certain features of the website and to use certain services, you must create and register an account with AKC (“Account”) on our Service and provide certain information about yourself and verifying a username, password, a valid email address and other information as may be applicable and requested during the creation of the Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to (a) never share your Account with anyone, (b) immediately notify us of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security, and (c) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. We will not be liable for any loss, damage or other liability arising from your failure to comply with this Section or from any unauthorized access to or use of your Account. We reserve the right to reject any registration or to terminate your Account and/or use of our Service in our sole discretion and without any liability to us. You represent and warrant that (1) all required information you submit is truthful, complete and accurate; (2) you will maintain the accuracy of the information updating any inaccurate information and (3) your use of the Website or Account does not and will not violate any of these Terms or the documents they incorporate by reference, or any applicable law or regulation.

Your Account may be restricted or terminated for any reason, at AKC’s sole discretion.

AKC does not allow for the creation of an Account by a person under the age of eighteen. AKC policy requires that dogs or litters registered or listed in the names of minors be properly authorized by the minor’s parent or guardian. With respect to an Account, this means the parent or guardian must establish, maintain and submit information on behalf of the minor.

**13.  REPRODUCTION OF ONLINE MATERIALS POLICY**
================================================

From time to time and at its sole discretion, AKC may grant permission to reproduce sections, stories, articles and/or graphics from the AKC website (hereafter, “AKC Material”) for offline use. Persons seeking to reproduce AKC Material for offline use must obtain prior authorization from AKC as outlined below.

**15.  AKC BREEDER REPORTS**
============================

AKC reports are only available electronically for download to your computer. If not all dogs are available, you will only receive a partial Research Pedigree Report.

An AKC Online Research Pedigree is a listing of the selected dog’s ancestry for four or five generations. The research pedigrees lists the registration number, registered name, coat color, Stud Book Date, and OFA or EYE numbers where applicable.

A progeny report lists all offspring of the selected sire or dam that have earned an AKC title, such as Champion (Ch) or Companion Dog (CD). This report does not list offspring that have not earned an AKC sanctioned title. [Click here for a list of titles.](https://www.apps.akc.org/events/titles.cfm) If you select the option to include the sire(s)/dam(s), your report will list both parents. We do not offer a report that lists dogs that have not earned a title.

Information about dogs whelped before 1980 and awards/results records for events held before 1986 may not be available in our online database and reports encompassing records prior to this date may include partial or no information. However, information about all AKC-registered dogs and all AKC-licensed and member events is maintained in our permanent archives. There are currently no reports available online or elsewhere that contain this information.

**16.  AKC COMPETITOR REPORTS**
===============================

All AKC Competitor Reports are online-only and will not be mailed, emailed or otherwise set to you. For a permanent copy, save the report to your hard drive. We do not issue refunds for printing problems.

### **AKC® Points and Awards Reports**

If the dog has event information prior to 1986 it is most likely not available online. Because the fee is a research fee, if you order an Awards Record for a dog that has a competition history prior to 1986, it may not be included and you will be charged for the research of the report, even if there are no competition results available online for the selected dog.

This report lists only events where your dog earned a requirement towards a title, such as points or a qualifying score.

### **AKC® Dogs Defeated Report**

To be eligible for dogs defeated points, a dog must win Best of Breed/Variety or higher at an AKC licensed or member All-Breed, Limited-Breed or Specialty event in the requested year.

These reports list the number of dogs defeated based on the following selected criteria:

* Breed – includes dogs defeated in breed/variety competition only
* Group – includes dogs defeated in Group competition only
* Overall – includes dogs defeated at all levels of competition; Breed, Group, and BIS

The totals are derived from dogs defeated at all AKC licensed All-Breed and Specialty dog shows held during the specified time period using the highest qualifying award earned at a show which is associated with the particular report. (For an All-Breed show, qualifying awards are Best in Show, Group First through Fourth, and Best of Breed or Variety, if the breed has varieties)

### **AKC® TopDogsSM Conformation Report**

An AKC Top Dogs report lists the top dogs rankings in Conformation events. You can choose from the top 25, 50 or 100 dogs. This report is based on the total number of dogs defeated. You can choose from top dogs at the breed, group or all-breed level.

These reports list the top dogs based on the following selected criteria:

1. Breed/Variety based on dogs defeated in just breed competition.
2. Breed/Variety based on dogs defeated in all levels of conformation competition.
3. Group based on all dogs defeated.
4. All-breed based on all dogs defeated.

The totals are derived from dogs defeated at all AKC licensed All-Breed and Specialty dog shows held during the specified time period using the highest qualifying award earned at a show. (For an All-Breed show, qualifying awards are Best in Show, Group First through Fourth, and Best of Breed or Variety, if the breed has varieties).

**Please note that the AKC Top Dog Reports using All-Breed totals include dogs defeated at the breed level whether the dog places in the group or not.**

The reports “By Breed using All-Breed Totals,” “By Group using All-Breed Totals” and “In All-Breed Competition” will list each dog’s name following by the number of dogs defeated in each level using the following criteria:

* The Best in Show winner shall get credit with defeating all dogs competing in conformation except itself.
* The Group First winner shall be credited with defeating all dogs competing in the breeds or varieties comprising the group except itself.
* The Group Second winner shall be credited with defeating the number of dogs defeated by the Group First winner, less the number of dogs competing in the breed or variety of the Group First winner.
* The Group Third winner shall be credited with defeating the number of dogs defeated by the Group Second winner, less the number of dogs competing in the breed or variety of the Group Second winner.
* The Group Fourth winner shall be credited with defeating the number of dogs defeated by the Group Third winner, less the number of dogs competing in the breed or variety of the Group Third winner.
* The Best of Breed or Variety winner shall be credited with defeating all dogs competing in that breed or variety except itself.

In the report “By Breed using Breed Totals” the number of dogs defeated will be calculated using the following criteria:

* The Best of Breed or Variety shall be credited with defeating all dogs competing in that breed or variety except itself.
* The Best of Breed winner at a Specialty show with varieties will not be credited with defeating all dogs competing in the breed.

Your selection of 25, 50 or 100 is a maximum criteria, not a minimum. We cannot guarantee that your report will contain exactly 25, 50 or 100 dogs. If, for example, only 14 dogs of a certain breed are participating in an event assuming they meet the other qualifications for the report selected, there will only be 14 dogs on any TopDog report for that breed and event. We cannot issue refunds for reports that do not contain the maximum number, if the data is otherwise correct.

### **AKC® TopDogs****SM** **Agility Invitational Report**

The AKC Agility Invitational report lists the top dogs ranked in Agility events and is based on the Top MACH Dog formula (Double Q’s x 10) + MACH (Master Agility Championship) points that dogs have earned during the qualifying period.

Dogs must have competed and qualified in Regular Master Standard & Jumpers With Weaves classes and the top five (5) ranked dogs of each breed will be included on these reports.

If there are not five (5) dogs ranked from the Regular Master classes, dogs will be ranked based on the Preferred Master Standard & Jumpers With Weaves classes using the Top PACH Dog formula (Double Q’s x 10) + PACH (Preferred Agility Championship) points that dogs have earned during the qualifying period. If the Top 5 of a breed are all from the Regular class, then an additional SIXTH invite will be sent to the Top Preferred Dog during round 1 invites. The reports will automatically sort the dogs alphabetically.

We cannot guarantee that your report will contain twenty-five (25) dogs. If, for example, only 10 dogs of a certain breed are participating in agility events, assuming that they meet the qualifications for the AKC Agility Invitational, there will only be 10 dogs listed on the report for that breed.

### **AKC® TopDogs****SM** **Agility Report**

An AKC Top Dogs report ranks the top dogs in Agility events and is based on the total number of points dogs have earned from either the Regular or Preferred Master Standard & Jumpers With Weaves classes. Dogs must have competed and qualified in Regular or Preferred Master Standard & Jumpers With Weaves classes to be eligible to be included on these reports.

When viewing the TopDogs Agility Report, you must first choose either the Regular or Preferred program report to rank dogs in the selected titling program. You may choose from the top 25, 50 or 100 dogs and you may sort the report by the dog’s title, points, or double Q’s. Select reports based on the dog’s breed, group, all AKC-recognized breeds, or the dog’s jump height. Since dogs are allowed to compete in the Regular classes at their required jump height or higher, when choosing the jump height report, the system will look at the last jump height a dog competed in and include the dog only in that jump height to calculate rankings.

AKC suggests that when pulling a current calendar year or previous calendar year report, that you base the sort order of the report on points and double Q’s only, not titles. The reason for this is because a title can be earned at any time during the dog’s lifetime and adding the title sort criteria to these reports will skew the data based on the title first then the points and double Q’s. The lifetime report can be sorted by titles, points or double Q’s.

Your selection of 25, 50 or 100 is a maximum criteria, not a minimum. We cannot guarantee that your report will contain exactly 25, 50 or 100 dogs. If, for example, only 14 dogs of a certain breed are participating in an event assuming they meet the other qualifications for the report selected, there will only be 14 dogs on any TopDog report for that breed and event. We cannot issue refunds for reports that do not contain the maximum number, if the data is otherwise correct.

### **AKC® TopDogs****SM** **Obedience Report**

An AKC Top Dogs report lists the top dogs rankings in Obedience events. You can choose from the top 25, 50 or 100 dogs. These reports list the top dogs in Obedience based on OTCH (Obedience Trial Champion) points earned. Reports are available for a breed, a group, or for all-breeds. In addition, reports may be generated for lifetime points earned or points earned in a given year.

Your selection of 25, 50 or 100 is a maximum criteria, not a minimum. We cannot guarantee that your report will contain exactly 25, 50 or 100 dogs. If, for example, only 14 dogs of a certain breed are participating in an event assuming they meet the other qualifications for the report selected, there will only be 14 dogs on any TopDog report for that breed and event. We cannot issue refunds for reports that do not contain the maximum number, if the data is otherwise correct.

### **AKC® TopDogs****SM** **National Obedience Championship Report**

The AKC National Obedience Championship report lists the top dogs ranked in Obedience events and is based on the total number of OTCH (Obedience Trial Championship) points earned during the qualifying period for this national event.

This report includes the top 50 ranked dogs by breed.

We cannot guarantee the number of dogs that your report will contain. If, for example, only 10 dogs of a certain breed are participating in obedience events, assuming that they meet the qualifications for the AKC National Obedience Championship, there will only be 10 dogs listed on the report for that breed.

### **AKC® TopDogs****SM** **Rally Report**

An AKC Top Dogs report ranks the top dogs in Rally events and is based on the total number of points and triple Q’s dogs have earned from the Rally Master, Rally Excellent B, and Rally Advanced B classes. Dogs must have qualified and earned points in one of these classes to be eligible to be included on these reports; or must have earned at least one triple Q. Dogs will begin to earn RACH points after they have earned the Rally Excellent (RE) title when scores of 91 or better are earned.

When viewing the AKC Top Dog – AKC® Rally Report, you may choose from the top 25, 50, or 100 dogs and sort the report by the dog’s Title, Points, Triple Q’s, or the dog’s “Score” which is a calculation of the dog’s (Triple Q’s x 10) + Points. Select reports based on the dog’s Breed, Group, or All AKC Recognized Breeds.

AKC suggests that when pulling a Current Calendar Year or Previous Calendar Year report, that you base the sort order of the report on Points, Triple Q’s or Score only, not titles. The reason for this is because a title can be earned at any time during the dog’s lifetime and adding the title sort criteria to these reports will skew the data based on the title first then the points and triple Q’s. The lifetime report can be sorted by Titles, Points, Triple Q’s or Score.

Your selection of 25, 50 or 100 is a _maximum_ criteria, not a minimum. We cannot guarantee that your report will contain exactly 25, 50 or 100 dogs. If, for example, only 14 dogs of a certain breed are participating in an event assuming they meet the other qualifications for the report selected, there will only be 14 dogs on any TopDog report for that breed and event. We cannot issue refunds for reports that do not contain the maximum number, if the data is otherwise correct.

### **AKC® TopDogs****SM** **Field Trial Pointing Breeds**

The standings for this report are calculated as follows: Open, Specials, and Veteran stakes will award the hounds placing first through fifth one point for itself, plus one point for each hound it has defeated in that stake. The winner of the Best of Breed will be awarded one point for every starter in its breed (including itself).

Your selection of 25, 50 or 100 is a _maximum_ criteria, not a minimum. We cannot guarantee that your report will contain exactly 25, 50 or 100 dogs. If, for example, only 14 dogs of a certain breed are participating in an event assuming they meet the other qualifications for the report selected, there will only be 14 dogs on any TopDog report for that breed and event. We cannot issue refunds for reports that do not contain the maximum number, if the data is otherwise correct.

DNA Profile Program is a voluntary program owners and breeders electing to add value to their breeding programs by eliminating concerns or questions about identification and parentage. Dog owner can contact AKC for DNA Test Kit (including a swab that owner uses to collect loose cells from inside the dog’s cheek). For each dog sampled, an AKC DNA Profile is created containing the dog’s registration information, genotype, and a unique DNA Profile number is issued.

AKC DNA Profiling is required for Frequently Used Sires, imported breeding stock, dog whose semen is collected for fresh-extended or frozen use, and sires, dam and puppies of Multiple-Sire Litter Registration.

To meet any AKC Registration requirement, all DNA testing must be performed through the AKC DNA Program.

=======================

You agree that: (i) we will be deemed solely based in the State of New York; and (ii) our Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and we agree that any Claim (as defined below) that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, will be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York, and that New York, New York is the proper and exclusive forum for any such proceedings.

**38.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**
==============================

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE YOU AND AKC TO ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and AKC that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of our Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using our Service; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with AKC, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms. However, prior to arbitration, all applicable AKC bylaws, rules, regulations and procedures must first be followed as set forth in the AKC Charter and Bylaws, rules, regulations, published policies and guidelines.

For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at [claims@akc.org](mailto:claims@akc.org) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that AKC has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or California, unless you and AKC agree otherwise. If you are using our Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and Arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using our Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and AKC agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether any provision of these Terms is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.

Nothing in this Section will be deemed as: preventing AKC from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of Content, data security, or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting Claims in small claims court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.

If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other Claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any Claim regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.

CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED OUR SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND AKC AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER AKC COLLECTORS. YOU AND AKC FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AKC ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.

**39.  ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS.**

**40.  SEVERABILITY.**
======================

In the event that any provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision will nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion will be deemed to be severed from these Terms, such determination will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

**41.  TERMINATION**
====================

The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date will survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes. These Terms are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate this agreement at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Service, or when you cease using our Service. If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination.

It is your responsibility to check our Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to our Service following the posting of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.

**43.  NO WAIVER**
==================

Our delay or failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**44.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT**

These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on our Service or in respect to our Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of our Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of these Terms). Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms will not be construed against us.

**45.  MISCELLANEOUS**

AKC’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be removed, and the remainder of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable. You authorize AKC to provide information concerning you and your activities to comply with applicable laws or respond to a court order, subpoenas, or other lawful requests, or if AKC thinks doing so would protect your safety or that of another person or protect the security of the services or as otherwise described in the [Privacy Notice](http://akc.org/privacy/).
