INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

Personal Information

We collect and have collected in the past twelve months, information that personally identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with a person (“Personal Information”), including:

• identifiers (e.g., name, social security number, taxpayer identification number, driver’s license number, date of birth, IP address, security questions & answers, mailing address, email address, phone number);  
• commercial information (i.e. account numbers, purchase history, payment activity)  
• internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Site, session logs and usage details;  
• characteristics of protected classifications under California and federal law (i.e. age)  
• professional or employment-related information (i.e. employer and/or job title)  
• geolocation  
• inferences drawn from the above categories  
• personal information as described in Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e) (i.e. information that identifies, relates to, or is capable of being associated with a particular individual,” such as a person’s name, signature, address, telephone number, medical records, employment history or credit card numbers) to the extent collected under another category of Personal Information above.

Some of the Personal Information listed above may be considered sensitive under relevant privacy laws. This includes social security number, driver’s license and other government identification card information, and your customer account login credentials. We refer to this type of Personal Information as “Sensitive Personal Information” in this Policy. Each type of Sensitive Personal Information may overlap with a category of Personal Information listed above.

The types of Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Site and/or Services and your relationship with us.

* Except with regard to any contact information you may provide us, all comments, feedback, and other information submitted to Endurance Warranty Services through or in association with this website will be considered non-confidential and the property of Endurance Warranty Services. By submitting such Feedback to Endurance Warranty Services, you agree that you assign to Endurance Warranty Services, without charge, all worldwide rights, title, and interest including copyrights and other intellectual property rights, in and to the Feedback. Endurance Warranty Services shall be free to use such Feedback on an unrestricted basis.

Business Information

We also collect information about businesses and their representatives that engage with us such as EIN, TIN, address, phone number, email address, bank account information (collectively, “Business Information”). This information is generally not considered Personal Information because it relates to a business. If such Business Information relates to a business contact person, we will treat it as Personal Information.

How we collect this information:

* Directly from you when you provide it to us.
* Third party data sources
* Automatically as you navigate through the Site. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses and information collected through cookies, web beacons and/or other tracking technologies.
    * We employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a user’s visit to the Site. This technology helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective, how consumers engage with the Site, and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from the Site. The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) “tracking pixels” and (2) “clear gifs.” Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a user has viewed a particular web page or email message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a user’s session and Personal Information, if provided by the user.
    * If you arrive at the Site by “clicking through” from another website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached the Site to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites and will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

* Targeted and Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising
    * We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers, ad networks (“Advertisers”) to learn more about you and show you ads or other content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Site or services we offer as well as other websites and services. These companies may use cookies, tracking pixels, and other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information. We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users and Advertisers may collect identifiers, commercial information, characteristics of protected classification, and internet information in connection with targeted and cross-context behavioral advertising activity. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Advertiser may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site or on third-party websites. You can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website at [www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) for information about Internet advertising companies and how to reduce information collection by such companies.
