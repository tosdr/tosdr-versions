Copyright 2024 Endurance Warranty Services, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Disclosure: A Vehicle Service Contract (VSC) is often referred to as an “auto warranty” or an “extended car warranty,” but it is not a warranty. A VSC does, however, provide repair coverage for your vehicle after the manufacturer’s car warranty expires. A VSC is a contract between you and a VSC provider or administrator that states what is a covered repair and what is not. Not all vehicles qualify for coverage, and not all repairs may be covered by the VSC you purchase. See contract for details. Not available in MA. In California Endurance sells Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI) underwritten by Security National Insurance Company and administered through Endurance Warranty Insurance Services, CA License #6009544. MBI is not a manufacturer's warranty; it provides repair coverage after your manufacturer's warranty expires.
