One of the most important aspects of the service is precisely the collection and processing of personal data of users so that when you perform a search for other users you will be shown the users who have a more compatible profile with you. Therefore, the more data you enter, and the more consistent these are with reality, the greater the possibility that the results we offer you in the searches are relevant to you.  
Given that the essential purpose of entering the data in your profile is that other users can see them, it is inevitable that these other users access to said data through the platforms of the subject. In addition to communicating the data to registered Users who perform the searches, access will also be given to unregistered Users. However, the data that will be offered to non-registered Users when they perform a search will be a summary of the profile data. The data considered by the legislation "specially protected" as the "racial origin" or the "religion" will not be offered in the summary searches that will be shown to the unregistered Users.
