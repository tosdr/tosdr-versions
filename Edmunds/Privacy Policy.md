### Edmunds Automotive Network

The Edmunds Automotive Network consists of the desktop and mobile versions of Edmunds.com and any other website that we identify as a part of the Edmunds Automotive Network; any apps that we offer; and widgets, tools and content that we offer for display on vehicle dealer and other third-party websites.

This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather on the Edmunds Automotive Network and how we obtain, use, share and manage it. In addition, this Privacy Statement addresses our receipt and use of information that may be "Personal information" or "Personal Data" under state consumer privacy laws, including "Personal Information" and "Personal Data" collected by us from sources other than the Edmunds Automotive Network. With that exception, this Privacy Statement is not applicable to information that we obtain through any of our other business activities or from other sources.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, you may contact us through our [Contact Us](https://help.edmunds.com/anonymous_requests/new) form.

### Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

We collect information that you voluntarily submit to the Edmunds Automotive Network to receive products and services or related information that you request from either us or companies with which we do business. The information you submit may include your name, address, e-mail address and/or telephone number. We refer to the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to us in response to requests therefor on the Edmunds Automotive Network as your "PII." (Unless we have a street address (or equivalent) for you, we do not consider your city, state or ZIP code to be your PII.)

We also collect information about the devices you use to access the Edmunds Automotive Network as soon as you visit the Edmunds Automotive Network. We do not consider this information to be your PII. However, certain device information may be considered "Personal Information" or "Personal Data" under state consumer privacy laws. See the "State Consumer Privacy Rights and Disclosures" section below for more information.

### Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Your PII may be shared between us and the companies with which we do business, and may also be disclosed to other entities that work with us or those companies to fulfill your request or to offer or provide other products and services to you.

We provide vehicle price quote and inquiry services and dealer communication services, including (i) our CarCode messaging service that enables emails, text and chats between a consumer and either a dealer or an Edmunds service provider, (ii) our vehicle trade-in and appraisal tools displayed on the Edmunds Automotive Network and dealer websites that enable a consumer to find our True Market ValueÂ® of a vehicle and that transmit such consumer's PII and that value to the dealer, (iii) dedicated dealer phone numbers displayed on the Edmunds Automotive Network, and (iv) our customer service department which, if a consumer contacts them, may act as an intermediary between such consumer and a dealer (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services").

If you use a Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service, we may use the phone number or email address that you use or provide to obtain or associate additional information about you. We keep copies of email, text and chat communications, and also may make and keep recordings of phone conversations between users of our Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services, including consumers and dealer personnel who communicate through our CarCode messaging service.

The phone number or email you provide; the additional information that we obtain using that information; the email, text and chat communications; and any call recordings may be made available to the dealer, to our services providers and the dealer's service providers to facilitate those communications, to vehicle manufacturers and/or their distributors, agents and contractors, and to any social media website or application from which you initiate a communication.

We may use whatever information we may have or know about you, including your PII, to customize or enhance your experience on the Edmunds Automotive Network (including the display of advertisements) and to provide, or communicate with you concerning, our products or services or those of companies with which we do business. We may use this information to optimize the manner in which the products or services you requested are operated and managed or to optimize the operation and management of other products and services. We may also use this information for purposes of reporting and analytics, including demonstrating to the companies with which we do business the effectiveness of our products and services. We use city, state and ZIP code (which we assign based on your IP address) to display to you information customized for your region.

We may disclose whatever information we may have or know about you, including your PII, without first providing additional notification to you or obtaining your consent: (a) to third-party service providers that provide advice, products or services to us, or that assist us to improve our products, services or information, or to better understand their value to our visitors or to the companies with which we do business or are considering doing business; (b) in connection with any merger or acquisition of Edmunds or a parent company, or any sale or other transfer of assets by Edmunds to another entity; or (c) to other third parties if we determine that disclosure of that information (i) is or may be required by law or legal process, or is requested by a governmental agency, (ii) is or may be reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds Automotive Network [Visitor Agreement](https://www.edmunds.com/about/visitor-agreement.html), or to take appropriate action if a visitor or other third party is determined by us to have violated that agreement, or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds or a parent company, the Edmunds Automotive Network, our visitors or other third parties (including, when applicable, consumers, dealers and manufacturers). In addition, we may disclose your PII to social media companies in a "hashed" (i.e., encoded) format that can only be recognized if you have an account with the recipient.

From time to time, we may also receive information requests for, and disclose to third parties, portions of the Edmunds Automotive Network's log files that show which "Internet service provider" a visitor has used or other visitor information; that information may enable third parties to discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.

### Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

In certain locations on the Edmunds Automotive Network where we obtain your PII, we may include a "check box" (or another process) for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive promotional and marketing communications and/or other information from other entities selected by us. By providing your consent (such as by "checking" the box, or leaving the box "checked"), you are agreeing to receive promotional and marketing communications from those other entities, and you are consenting to our providing your PII to those other entities.

If you no longer wish to receive promotional and marketing communications from us or our partners, you may do so (i) if you received a promotional or marketing email from us, by following the link for that purpose located at the bottom of the email, or (ii) by sending a request to us through our [Contact Us](https://help.edmunds.com/anonymous_requests/new) form. However, withdrawing your consent will not affect the rights of the other entities that previously received your PII to continue to send communications to you and otherwise use your PII, except as otherwise may be required under state consumer privacy law.

If you have registered on Edmunds.com, we may send you certain administrative and service messages in connection with the products and services available to you; you cannot opt out of receiving those communications, except as may be otherwise required under state consumer privacy or other United States law.

See the "State Consumer Privacy Rights and Disclosures" section below for information about your ability to make choices about the use and disclosure of your "Personal Information" and "Personal Data."

### Information We Collect Through Cookies and Other Technologies

When you visit the Edmunds Automotive Network, we may place pieces of code, commonly referred to as "cookies," on your computer or other devices you use to access the Edmunds Automotive Network, such as your mobile phone or tablet, or use other technology to collect and retain information about you, such as your IP address and ZIP code, as soon as you visit the Edmunds Automotive Network.

Edmunds has not implemented a response to browser-based Do Not Track signals, except for the Global Privacy Control as described in the State Consumer Privacy Rights and Disclosures section below. Because of the current lack of consensus with respect to the Do Not Track standard from both a compliance perspective and a technical perspective, we have not yet determined if or how we would implement a response to Do Not Track signals. We will continue to evaluate this in the event a uniform standard is adopted.

Certain browsers may allow you to disable cookies. However, disabling cookies from the Edmunds Automotive Network may prevent you from using various features of the Edmunds Automotive Network.

Please see the "State Consumer Privacy Rights and Disclosures" section below for information about Edmunds' response to Global Privacy Control signals.

Your social media privacy settings may enable the Edmunds Automotive Network to retrieve information from your social media accounts, including your usernames, profile photo, the date and time you sent messages using a social media application, and the contents of those messages.

Occasionally we or another company on our behalf may conduct visitor surveys to better target our content to our audience, to improve our products and services, or for the benefit of third parties with which we do business. Accordingly, sometimes the aggregated survey results are shared with our advertisers and other third parties. We never share any survey information about any identified individual with any third party unless that individual consents.

### Our Community Services

The Edmunds Automotive Network provides a number of means by which you may communicate with other visitors and with us.

The [Visitor Agreement](https://www.edmunds.com/about/visitor-agreement.html) sets forth a number of information-sharing and disclosure practices for those services, and accordingly supplements this Privacy Statement.

### Third-Party Ad Servers and Advertisers

We use third party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements; to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement and site analytics; and to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time on the Edmunds Automotive Network and across other websites and online services.

### Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising

The cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (the "Program") was developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet. Edmunds has elected to implement the Program.

The Program applies to "online behavioral advertising," which is defined as the collection of data online from a particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time, and across non-affiliate websites, for the purpose of using that data to predict visitor preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from those Web viewing behaviors. (The Program does not apply to a website's collection of viewing behavior solely for its own uses, or to "contextual advertising" that delivers advertisements based on the content of a Web page, a search query or a visitor's contemporaneous behavior on a website.)

Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other websites to target ads to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other websites and online services.

In addition, the Edmunds Automotive Network may from time to time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable website usage information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads on other websites and online services. To do this, we permit those third parties to place and use cookies on the browsers of our visitors, and use Web beacons and other tracking technologies on the Edmunds Automotive Network. These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across websites and online services.

Other companies' use of information collected through their cookies and other tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies and not this one. To learn more about your choices and how to opt out from receiving the types of ads described above, please [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or paste [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) into your internet browser.

You may also opt out of tracking and receiving the types of ads described above on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and similar entities by modifying your device settings or downloading the App Choices app at [www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your Personal Information, both during transmission to us and once we receive it.

Edmunds uses Internet Activity Data it collects on a dealer website for reporting and analytics purposes, including demonstrating to that dealer the effectiveness of Edmunds' products and services.  
      
    
* Edmunds uses your Credit Information only to provide products and services to you, to calculate customized vehicle lease or loan payments for you for a vehicle that you have selected, and to advise the dealer offering that vehicle that you qualify for those lease or payment terms.  
      
    
* To the extent that Edmunds maintains Deidentified Information, Edmunds commits to maintain and use that information in a deidentified form and not reidentify it, except as may be allowed by law.  
      
    
* Edmunds may disclose all categories of Personal information:  
      
    

* To service providers with which Edmunds contracts to provide services to us and that need to use and process such Personal Information in order to provide such services;
* To Dealers and Manufacturers (with which Edmunds does business or is considering doing business);
* To actual or potential counterparties, and their representatives, counsel, advisors and agents, in connection with any merger by, or acquisition of, Edmunds or a parent company, or any sale or other transfer of assets by Edmunds or a parent company to another entity; and
* To law enforcement; governmental entities; Edmunds' representatives, counsel, advisors and agents; and other third parties if Edmunds determines that disclosure of that information (i) is or may be required by law or legal process, or is requested by law enforcement or a governmental agency, (ii) is or may be reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds Automotive Network [Visitor Agreement](https://www.edmunds.com/about/visitor-agreement.html), or to take appropriate action if a visitor or other third party is determined by us to have violated that agreement, or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Edmunds or its parent company, the Edmunds Automotive Network, Edmunds' visitors or other third parties (including, when applicable, Consumers or Dealers)  
      
    

* Edmunds discloses User-Provided and Associated Identifiers to the Dealers whom you have selected or have vehicles that you have specified. In some instances, Edmunds also sends User-Provided and Associated Identifiers to Manufacturers who granted franchises to those Dealers and/or those Manufacturers' contractors and agencies. This disclosure may be considered a "sale" under the laws of California and certain other Covered States' laws.  
      
    
* Edmunds may also disclose User-Provided Identifiers to service providers that work with us to fulfill requests you submit to us, to facilitate communications between Consumers and Dealers, or provide other products and services, and to social media companies in a "hashed" (i.e., encoded) format that can only be recognized if you have an account with the recipient. The disclosure to social media companies may be considered a "sale" under the laws of California and certain other Covered States laws even though we do not receive any monetary compensation from the social media companies in return for the information disclosed.  
      
    
* In addition, when you log into or associate one of your social media accounts with an Edmunds' Dealer Inquiry and Communication Service, Edmunds discloses certain User-Provided and Associated Identifiers to the social media provider of that account, and the dealer or consumer with which you are communicating may have access to those identifiers.  
      
    
* Edmunds discloses Internet Activity Data to Manufacturers for advertising purposes, to social networks for purposes of facilitating advertising on their platforms, to companies that place advertising on third party websites on behalf of Edmunds or its clients, and to companies who display advertising and/or provide targeted internet audience data and/or other services to advertisers or to companies that display advertising. Edmunds may disclose Internet Activity Data (together with User-Provided Identifiers) to companies that use that data to provide their own services to Dealers and Manufacturers. Edmunds may also allow a vendor to collect Internet Activity Data to provide analytics services to Edmunds. The disclosures described above may be considered "sales" under California and other states' laws.  
      
    
* When you use Edmunds to obtain offers from third parties to purchase your vehicle, Edmunds sends your User-Provided Identifiers to the Dealers that make those offers and/or companies that obtain those offers from Dealers. When you use Edmunds to estimate the trade-in or sale value of your vehicle, Edmunds may also send your User-Provided Identifiers to Dealers who may be interested in your vehicle and this disclosure may be considered a "sale" or sharing for cross context behavioral advertising under California and certain other states' laws.  
      
    
* When you use an Edmunds product or service to calculate or obtain from Edmunds your estimated lease or loan payments for a vehicle offered by a Dealer for sale or lease -- and if you consent -- Edmunds transmits your Credit Information to a company that uses that information to obtain additional information about your credit from a credit reporting agency, which then sends Edmunds a transaction ID that allows Edmunds to collect your FICO score. The credit reporting agency may make available to the Dealer offering that vehicle your FICO score and other credit information. In addition, Edmunds may disclose to that Dealer your self-reported approximate credit score, FICO score and estimated payment terms and may also advise that dealer either that Edmunds believes that you prequalify for those payment terms for that vehicle or that Edmunds did not have sufficient information to determine if you prequalify.

We retain the Personal Information we collect for as long as reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes disclosed at the point of collection or in this Privacy Statement or for other business purposes, unless a shorter or longer retention period is required by law or contract. The length of retention may vary depending upon factors such as:

* The existence of an ongoing relationship between you and us;

* Service, product and network security and integrity purposes; and
* The need to resolve inquiries or complaints
