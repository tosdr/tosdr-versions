[i have always wanted to learn how to take a mirror ![i have always wanted to learn how to take a mirror selfie and challenged myself to learn while we were in aruba. so many of you followed along when I posted them to my stories each day, and it really helped reduce the second hand embarrassment I felt. ☺️ as it turns out, a lot of you also struggle with mirror selfies, so I thought I’d share the tips my friend nancy (@thecalibamamom ) sent to me:
—stand directly in the middle of the mirror
—turn the lower half of your body slightly to one side
—bend the knee of the leg in front
—do something with the arm/hand that isn’t holding the camera
—look at yourself in your phone instead of the mirror and then take the photo
—once you’ve mastered this pose, try lowering the phone slightly and looking into the mirror, but be careful not to tilt your head up
lmk if these help! ✨
