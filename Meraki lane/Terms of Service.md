[thirteen. how did THAT happen? it feels like just ![thirteen. how did THAT happen? it feels like just yesterday that your dad and i were meeting you for the first time with so many memories and milestones ahead of us, and now it feels like life is moving way too quickly. 
looking back at these photos and videos has reminded me of all the things you and i have been through together. and as i was trying to find the perfect song to capture all of the feels i am feeling right now, i remembered a conversation i had with my dad when I was leaving home. he told me he was proud of me and when i rolled my eyes, he looked around my university dorm room and said something like, “you could drop out of school tomorrow and i would still be just as proud.”
i’ve thought about that conversation a lot over the years. in the moment, it sounded crazy. up until that point in my life, i’m not sure i had ever really done anything simply because i wanted to — the goal was always to do what i thought was expected of me in order to make my parents proud. and it worked. i knew they were proud of me. but now that i am a parent, i know exactly what my dad was trying to say to me before I started living on my own.
it isn’t the grades, awards, achievements, etc. that make me proud of you C. yes, they make me happy and i enjoy seeing you do the things that interest you and are important to you, and i will take advantage of every opportunity you give me to show you off to the world. but it is YOU that makes me proud. all of those other things are just a bonus, and i could take them or leave them. you are enough.
my wish for you on your 13th birthday is that you have the courage to live life on your terms. it should never be about fitting in or doing things to make other people happy. the goal is to create a life that YOU are proud of, and you must learn not to let the opinions of other people get in the way of going after the things that are important to you. if you can do that, you can do anything. ❤️
happy birthday sweet bear.
i love you more than everything.
EVERYTHING.
