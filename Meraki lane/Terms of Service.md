[4 lessons that helped me let go of other people’ ![4 lessons that helped me let go of other people’s opinions ⬇️
✨no one thinks about us as much as we think they do, and when we’re confident in who we are, their opinions of us don’t matter anyway.
✨no one is coming to save us –– we are responsible for our own happiness.
✨we are responsible for the decisions we make, how  we spend our time, the way we speak to ourselves and the company we keep.
✨time is a gift that should not be wasted on petty sh*t that does not matter.
my body may not look or feel the way it once did, but my 40s have put life into perspective for me and turned me into the person i’ve always wanted to be. 💖
