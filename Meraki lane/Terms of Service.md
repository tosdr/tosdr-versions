[We said goodbye to my sister yesterday and it was ![We said goodbye to my sister yesterday and it was so incredibly difficult. After sharing the news with the people closest to me, I sat down to draft something to post on my personal facebook page. I’m usually pretty good with words, but I sat there for an hour typing and then deleting everything that came to my mind.
I could share so many examples of how strong and fierce my sister was, I have tons of funny things we experienced as kids that would make you laugh, and I would love to tell you some of the quirks she had that we loved. But for once in my life I just don’t know what to say. She did not want the world to see the difficult parts of her life, and after all she endured over the last year, I can’t bring myself to share anything funny.
But if you would indulge me for a few minutes, I would like to share what an impact she had on me. 
She took her role as my older sister very seriously and taught me so much over the last 47 years — to look past people’s differences and accept them as they are, to lead with kindness and positivity, to be inclusive, to let go of anger, and to hope for the best instead of assuming the worst. 
These lessons popped up again and again as we grew up together and shaped me into the person I am today, but the most important thing she taught me is how precious life is. No matter how much she was suffering while she was sick, she accepted any and every option presented to her that would allow her more time. This really gave me pause and put things into perspective for me, reminding me daily that time is a gift and tomorrow isn’t promised. She was teaching me about life right until the very end.
We love you and we miss you so much Bev. You left such a positive mark on our lives, and the void we feel in our hearts from your absence will never, ever be filled. After receiving so many messages from your friends the last 2 days, I know you had an impact on them too. The only thing that makes saying goodbye easier is knowing you are with Dad. If I close my eyes I can hear the 2 of you up there laughing and it makes all of this sting a little bit less. Give him a hug from me.
