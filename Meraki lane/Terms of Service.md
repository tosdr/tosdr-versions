[i was a guest on the @simplepinmedia podcast last ![i was a guest on the @simplepinmedia podcast last month, discussing how i started meraki lane, and one of the questions kate asked me was ‘what advice would you give to someone who is just starting out?’ i get asked this a lot, and my biggest advice is this: be yourself and don’t listen to what other people say. what works for them will not necessarily work for you, and pretending to be someone you’re not isn’t sustainable and will effect the quality of what you produce. if you pursue something that interests you and that you are 100% yourself with, it will pay off in the long run. the key is to put your blinders on, focus on the things that are authentic to you, and remember that the people with the most to say are usually the ones who feel the most threatened by you. their opinions don’t pay your bills so wish them well and keep going.
if you’re interested in hearing more about my story, i’ve linked to the podcast in my bio. ❤️

[we unplugged and enjoyed a week in aruba and it wa ![we unplugged and enjoyed a week in aruba and it was everything we had hoped for (and more). if you’ve never been and want to go, here are the details of our trip plus some thoughts and notes. 
we stayed at @bucutitara which is an adults-only resort and an absolutely gorgeous property. it is located on eagle beach which is less crowded, and we were able to get lounge chairs with an umbrella everyday. the breakfast buffet is included and had everything — i looked forward to it each morning. 😋 they only have one restaurant at the hotel but i would have happily eaten every lunch and dinner there. the food was fabulous.
we explored palm beach both in the day and at night and loved it. it was a totally different vibe from where we were staying with lots of fabulous restaurants and beautiful hotels for families. the beach was just as stunning as eagle beach but definitely more crowded.
we rented a car for 2 days and explored the island. it was really cool to kick around but not necessary. taxis are affordable and easy to find.
the only downside is that there is not a lot to do in the way of shopping outside of renaissance mall (which is all high end stores), a few random stores in palm beach, and lots of stalls selling touristy things. the selection of local jewelry was 👌🏻 though so it was a success from my pov.
oh and huge bonus: you can drink the tap water in aruba and there are water fountains everywhere to fill up your water bottle.
aruba was a 10/10 for us. we’re already planning our next trip. ✨
