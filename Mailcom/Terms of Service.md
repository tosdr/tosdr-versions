You also agree that mail.com may automatically debit your Payment Account, without further authorization from you, for any renewal term, additional services, and any fees or expenses applicable to your Services, including but not limited to fees for your use of services in excess of those included within your Services. If payment in full is not received by mail.com from the provider of your Payment Account or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due from you for your Services without demand by mail.com. Termination of your account shall not relieve you of any obligation to pay any accrued fees or charges.  
  
3.2. In addition, certain mail.com Services may be subject to set-up, service, or other fees, and by registering for such mail.com Services you authorize mail.com to debit your Payment Account for any and all such fees.  
  
3.3. Your credit or debit card issuer, directly or through third-party service providers, may provide mail.com with updated credit card numbers, expiration dates, or other information which may be used to renew services or make payments under this Agreement. Should mail.com choose, in its sole discretion, to participate in such auto-update programs, you agree that mail.com may share your Payment Account information with such third-party providers and may update Your Payment Account with information provided through such services. You authorize any and all charges to your Payment Account using such updated information, whether or not you or mail.com have prior notice of same. Mail.com cannot guarantee that your Payment Account will be updated, and you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to keep your payment information current and up-to-date at all times and that you shall be liable to mail.com for your failure to do so, including for any charges that mail.com may incur as a result of your failure to keep your payment information current. mail.com shall have no liability for declined payments or incomplete or out-of-date Payment Account information.

Promotional fees and special offers may not be combined.  
  
3.5. Certain special offers for Premium Services may include a free introductory period. Unless you terminate your account prior to the expiration of such introductory period you agree that you will be liable for and mail.com may automatically debit your Payment Account for the Fees for the Premium Services associated with that account. mail.com reserves the right at any time to withhold, modify, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, such introductory or promotional offers, with or without notice.  
  
3.6. Changes to your Services, including downgrades by you or termination of your Premium Services, may result in loss of your Data, features, or a reduction in the amount of available capacity for your Data provided by the mail.com Services. To the extent you receive a special reduced price as part of a bundled offer, the special price shall only apply as long as all of the bundled services remain; accordingly, canceling any one of the bundled services will result in a higher price for each of the remaining services unless it was arranged differently in the special offer. The amount charged to your Payment Account on the next billing cycle will be automatically updated to reflect any changes to the subscription, including upgrades or downgrades or the cancellation of bundled services.  
  
3.7. You shall pay all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs, in the event any invoice requires collection efforts as determined in mail.com’s sole discretion. Except where prohibited by law, all accounts referred to a collection agency shall be subject to an additional fee, which must be paid in full before the account is reactivated.  
  
3.8. International Customers bear the risk of currency fluctuations and any fees or taxes associated with the conversion of foreign currencies into United States Dollars. Certain mail.com Services will not be available to International Customers until mail.com is able to receive satisfactory confirmation from such customer’s Payment Account provider, in mail.com’s sole discretion, that the funds will be available for debit from the International Customer’s account. Orders from International Customers will not be accepted unless the country provided in the contact information matches that on file for the Payment Account.  
  
3.9. You agree that mail.com may start the provision of services immediately, and that you will not be entitled to cancellation or a "cooling off" period except to the extent a waiver of those rights is prohibited by applicable law.  
  
3.10. Even if your mail.com Services are free, you may still incur expenses for internet access or data transmission from third-party service providers not affiliated with mail.com.
