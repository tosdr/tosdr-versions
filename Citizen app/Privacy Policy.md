Privacy Policy for Citizen Services
===================================

Citizen’s mission is to keep you safe and informed.

Protecting your privacy is fundamental to the way sp0n, Inc., the company that does business as Citizen and operates the Citizen mobile app and [www.citizen.com](http://www.citizen.com/), including its subsidiaries and affiliated entities under common ownership and control, (“sp0n” or “Citizen”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) conduct business and provide our services. This Privacy Policy describes our collection, use and disclosure of the information we may collect from you whenever you visit any of our digital properties, website(s) (hereinafter a “Site” and collectively the “Sites”), or otherwise interact with us or access any of our application, products, services, and content (hereinafter the “Platform”). The Sites and the Platform are together referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Services”. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all visitors and customers accessing the Services. If you become an inactive customer, or if we close or suspend your account, we will continue to adhere to the Privacy Policy in place when we collect your personal information as long as we retain it in our databases. We may delete any or all of your information at any time without notice to you or for any reason or no reason unless we are otherwise required by law or retain it. You may have other privacy protections under state laws and we encourage you to refer to the Jurisdiction Specific Privacy Rights Statement to review these. Unless otherwise specifically noted, this Policy does not apply to your use of third-party sites linked to in the Services.

**Updates and Supplemental Notices to this Privacy Policy**

We may provide additional or supplemental privacy notices for specific products or services that we offer at the time of collection. Unless otherwise noted, those supplemental notices should be read together with this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The “Effective Date” legend at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy and your continued access to the Services is deemed to be your acceptance of those changes, so we encourage you to check back periodically for updates.

Citizen Privacy Practices
-------------------------

### Our principles for protecting your data

* We record the information we need to provide our services: informing you of incidents happening around you, and helping you get emergency assistance when you’re in need.  
* The personal information we do collect we store for as short a duration as possible. And, where possible, we store only de-identified or aggregate data that is not tied to you.
* We generally limit access to your data to a subset of the engineering team. We have specific systems to control data access, and all access is logged and regularly audited.
* We take protecting your location data seriously. We need accurate, real-time location data to alert you of any emergencies and to help you get emergency assistance, but we lower the resolution of historical location data where possible.
* We test the stability and security of our infrastructure, including annual penetration testing and review of our security systems and their configurations. We use an information security firm to provide these services under a strict non-disclosure agreement. 
* Our services are designed to provide real-time notifications of incidents occurring near you, and to help you get assistance in the case of an emergency. We can only provide those services in certain areas, so if you are located outside of one of those areas, the services may not work for you. We only intend to provide our services in the United States.

### Public data

* Content visible to any other user on the Citizen platform is considered public data (for example, publicly posted comments and videos). You have control over public data on Citizen tied to your account, and can delete comments and videos you have posted. You can also delete your account from the app or email support@citizen.com to request to delete your account.

### Business Purpose for Collection and Use of Data

Identifiers

We may collect or access some of your contact and login details such as your name, login or screen name, postal address, IP address, email address so that we can provide you with the Services or support. In addition, we may need you to provide an image of your driver’s license or government issued ID, but we only do this if we need to confirm your identity in response to a request from you to access, update, or delete your personal information under your privacy rights. For marketing purposes, we also place cookies, pixel tags, and similar identifiers and tracking technologies that may collect additional information about you and how you interact with our Site and Services.

We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our networks and visitors to our Services and a contractual basis for fulfilling your request for services.

Contents of Communications

When you reach out to us for support, interact with the Platform, or ask to learn more about our Services, we collect personal information such as your email address and phone number.

We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our networks and visitors to our Services, responding to your communications and requests for information, and a contractual basis for fulfilling your request for services.

Audio/Video/Visual/Electronic

When you use our Services as intended, and voluntarily provide or upload any alerts to help our other users, we collect or receive photographs, audio, videos, recorded calls, voicemails, and electronic communications that you submit. These may include content made via a live or automated online interaction within the Services or submitted by you in the form of a photo, video, or other content.

We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our networks and Services and the content posted by users. We also provide the Services on a contractual basis to you.

Captured Content

The purpose of our Services is for all our users to alert one another of issues and incidents. If you use the Services as intended to capture a video or other content you wish to make publicly available, you do so voluntarily and we collect and store that content and additional information about the content and device you used and how you accessed the Services.

We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our networks and Services and the content posted by users.

Customer Records

We may collect digital and electronic signatures, and telephone numbers.

We have a contractual basis for fulfilling your request for services.

Online Account or Credit Card Info Combined with a Security/Access Code

We offer Premium Services that require payment from you. In order to collect and process those payments, we may use third party payment processors that collect credit or debit card numbers, or financial account information that is combined with a security or access code. This information, if collected, is considered sensitive personal information.

We have a contractual basis for fulfilling your request for services.

Inferences

We try to provide you with the Services you want and need and in those efforts, we may collect inferences about your preferences, characteristics, behavior and attitudes.

We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our networks and visitors to our Services.

Log and Usage Data

We take measures to protect and improve our Services. In these efforts, we may collect log and usage data for service related purposes such as diagnostic, usage, and performance information collected by our servers when you access or use our Services. We record this information in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about activity on the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you access), device event information (such as system activity, error reports, and hardware settings).

We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our networks and visitors to our Services.

Device Data

We take various measures to protect and improve our Services. In these efforts, we may collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet Service provider and/or mobile provider, operating system, and system configuration information.

Location Data

We may use your location data to route real-time safety alerts to you, like a fire in your building, an abducted child or a dangerous situation near you. You choose whether to share your location, and can always revoke Citizen’s access to your location data in your device settings, but the app will not properly function if the app can’t access location data. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your location setting on your device but doing this may inhibit your access to certain aspects of the Services.

We have a contractual basis for fulfilling your request for services.

User Contacts

Because our Services are a network of users, when you share your contacts with us, you direct us to let your friends know that you have joined Citizen, so they may connect with you. In addition, when you use Citizen Premium, you direct us to share some of your information with the friends and family members you designate, with your emergency contacts, and with first responders in order to assist you in the event of an emergency.

### 4\. Data Security

Protecting you means protecting your data. Citizen limits access to your data to only those Citizen employees who require access in order to provide you with the Services. We have organizational and technical measures and safeguards in place that are designed to secure and protect your personal information. The use of, and access to, your personal information by us is restricted to authorized individuals who need to know that information to provide services to you, and who receive training about the importance of protecting personal information. Our service providers and business partners are also contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality of personal information and may not use the information for any unauthorized purposes.

Unfortunately, no method of transmission of information via the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to us through our website or other electronic means. Any electronic transmission of personal information is at your own risk. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach of your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

If you believe your information is not secure, please immediately notify us of the problem at the address provided in the [Contact Information](#10_contact_info) section below.

### 5\. Retention of Personal Information

Generally, we will hold your personal information for as long as you remain a Customer of ours or as long as necessary to perform the activities described in this Privacy Policy, unless we have an ongoing legitimate business need that requires a different retention period. We retain the information in order to provide and maintain the quality of the Services you have requested, or if we are obliged to retain such information for legal, regulatory, fraud prevention, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use and/or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When our legitimate business need for retaining your personal information ceases to exist, we will either delete or anonymize your information so that it can no longer be attributed to you.

### 6\. Other Important Information

#### A. Agent Call Recording  

We may collect certain categories of personal information from you when you interact with one of our agents or  through the use of session replay tools. Session replay is a visual tool that recreates your interactions with our Agent and through the Services, giving us a better understanding of this interaction to help maximize your user experience. Session replay tools that we may utilize include, but are not limited to, video-like playback, error tracking integration, application performance monitoring (APM) integration, real user monitoring (RUM) session timeline, and speed controls. Depending on your interaction with our agents or the Services (e.g. when you complete a “Contact Us” form), the categories of personal information we may also capture include, but are not limited to, name, phone number, email, mailing address, and other identifiers that you may provide. By interacting in this way, you are consenting to us capturing any interactions and any personal information you provide.

#### B. Links to Third Party Services  

Our Services may include links to third party services where you might be able to post comments, reviews, or view third party information. Please note, the inclusion of a link on our Services to a third party’s service does not imply endorsement of the third party’s data handling practices, and does not imply that the third party’s practices are covered by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.

#### C. Children’s Information  

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 18 and  our Services are not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under the age of 18. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 18. If we become aware of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately comply with our legal obligations and delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 18, please do so by emailing us at support@citizen.com or at: sp0n, Inc., 197 Grand St, Ste 3W, New York, NY 10013, USA.

#### D. Conducting Data Analytics  

We are an innovative business, which relies on developing sophisticated products and services by drawing on our experience from prior engagements. We may create aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect.  We make personal information into de-identified and/or anonymized data by removing information that makes the data identifiable to you.  

We are not concerned with an analysis of identifiable individuals, and we take steps to ensure that your rights and the legitimacy of our activities are ensured through the use of aggregated or otherwise de-identified data. We may use this aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve our Services and to promote our business.  We will not attempt to re-identify any such data, except as permitted by law.

#### E. Targeted Advertising Practices  

We may rely on a third-party services provider to either display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on other sites. These service providers may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Services in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

#### F. Non-Personal Information.   

This Privacy Policy does not restrict our collection, use or disclosure of any aggregated information or information that does not identify, or cannot be reasonably linked to, any individual.

#### G. Accessibility 

If you have a disability and require an alternative format to this Policy, please email us at support@citizen.com so that we may provide you with a more suitable format.

### 7\. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Citizen and our partners (e.g., marketing partners, analytics, advertising, or service providers) may use various tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts to analyze trends on our Services, administer our Services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

Cookies are small data files that we transfer to your device to collect information about your use of the Services. Cookies can be recognized by the site that downloaded them or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if your browsing device has visited them before.

Generally, information collected by cookies and other tracking technologies does not constitute personal information, however, if a cookie we use ever collects any personal information from you, we will treat it carefully as we discuss in this Policy. We use both first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are set by us and third-party cookies are operated by third parties that can recognize your device both when it visits the Services and when it visits other websites or mobile applications. We do not control how third-party cookies are used, and we encourage you to check the websites of any third-party cookies providers for more information on how they use cookie information.

We use “persistent” and “session” cookies, persistent cookies are used to save information for longer periods of time while session cookies are deleted when you close your browser or after a short period of time. You can delete the cookie data in your browser. We use cookies to understand how you are using and interacting with our Services and they provide invaluable insight about how we can improve our Services and help us with marketing to you based on your interests and preferences.

### 8\. Privacy Rights and Choices

Depending on applicable law where you reside or are located, you may be able to assert certain rights with respect to your personal information. Any rights you may have in relation to your personal information are not absolute. We reserve the right to refuse to act on a request that is manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example because it is repetitive) and/or to charge a fee that takes into account the administrative costs for providing the information or taking the action requested.

For more information on the rights you may have, please refer to the information in the Jurisdiction Specific Notices found at the end of this Privacy Policy.

To make a privacy rights request, please contact us by email at support@citizen.com or contact use the webform available [here](https://support.citizen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=22821426069655).

In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your personal information corrected, deleted, or other limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. We may only implement requests with respect to personal information that is associated with the particular email address that you use to send your request.

You may use an authorized agent to submit a rights request on your behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf, we will require you to directly verify your identity with us, or have you directly confirm with us that the authorized agent has been authorized to act on your behalf.

Depending upon the applicable law, access to your rights may be denied: (a) when denial of access is required or authorized by law; (b) when granting access would have a negative impact on another’s privacy; (c) to protect our rights and properties; or (d) where the request is frivolous or vexatious, or for other reasons.

### 9\. International Data Transfers

We are a global business, with a primary location in the US, but we may store, process and transmit personal information in locations around the world, including locations outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located.

### California Privacy Notice

Last Updated: April 22, 2024

This California Privacy Notice (the “CA Notice”) supplements the information contained in our Privacy Policy and applies solely to individual residents of the State of California ("consumers" or "you"). The purpose of this California Privacy Policy is to provide consumers with a comprehensive description of Company’s online and offline practices regarding the collecting, use, disclosure, and sale of personal information and of the rights of consumers regarding their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) (collectively “CA Privacy Laws”). This section does not apply to our collection, use, and sharing of personal information of our job applicants and employees.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, all terms in this CA Notice have the same meaning as defined in our Privacy Policy or as otherwise defined in the CA Privacy Laws.

#### **Collection and Use of Personal Information**

We collect personal information from and about consumers for a variety of purposes. To learn more about the types of personal information we collect and how we collect it, please refer to Sections [1](#1_personal_info) and [7](#7_cookies) in the Privacy Policy above. To see the purposes for which we use this information, please refer to Sections [1](#1_personal_info), [2](#2_why_we_collect) and [7](#7_cookies) in the Privacy Policy.

The CCPA defines a “business purpose” as the use of personal information for the business’s operational purposes, or other notified purposes, provided the use of personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the operational purpose for which the personal information was collected or another operational purpose that is compatible with the context in which the personal information was collected.

To the extent this practice is interpreted to constitute a “sale” under the CA Privacy Laws, please see our Cookie Policy for more information including how to exercise your rights to opt-out of cookies, analytics and personalized advertising.
