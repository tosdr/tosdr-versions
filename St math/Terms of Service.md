The following Terms of Use, or “Terms” are the rules that govern use of the websites operated by MIND Education (“MIND”, “we”, “us”, “our”), including those located at mindeducation.org, stmath.com, and such other websites and mobile applications (“App(s)”) as may be operated by MIND (“Site(s)”), including our ST Math® software products that may be accessed by students or teachers via such sites and applications (the “Software”). By downloading an App or otherwise using a Site, you and the entity that you represent, if applicable (“you”, “your”) agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. This Agreement also incorporates by reference our Privacy Policy located at [www.stmath.com/privacy-policy](https://www.stmath.com/privacy-policy), as it may be updated from time to time pursuant to the terms herein and therein. Software licensed by parents/legal guardians for homeschooling will be subject to the end user license agreement (“Homeschooling EULA”) provided with such Software.

**NOTE:** SECTION 5 (Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution; No Class Actions) BELOW CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS AND WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH US.

1. ### 1\. Use of the Sites and Software.
    
    * **Users of Our Sites and Software.**
        
        Certain of our Sites host our ST Math® instructional Software, which has been developed for use by students from pre-kindergarten through high school (“Student(s)”), for the improvement of math-related skills and achievement. Students are provided access to our Software and Sites through their schools and school districts (collectively, “Local Educational Agencies” or “LEAs”), who utilize these services to assess their Students’ progress and supplement their mathematics curriculum.
        
        **Student Users.**
        
        If you are a Student, you may only use the Sites and Software if you are at least 13 years of age, or if you are otherwise using the Sites and/or Software with the consent and under the supervision of your parent, legal guardian, or teacher / school representative.
        
        **Teachers/LEA Users.**
        
        If you represent a school or other LEA, you hereby represent, warrant, and covenant on behalf of such school or other LEA that (a) you have the authority to disclose any Student Records (as defined under the Privacy Policy) provided to us for your Students hereunder, and have obtained all consents necessary for same, and (b) that you have not and will not breach any applicable laws in the collection, disclosure, or use of the Student Records hereunder.
        
        **LEAs’ Obligations for Students Under 13.**
        
        If you have Students under 13 who will use the Sites or Software, you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information as set forth in our Privacy Policy from your Student users under the age of 13. You also agree to use the Sites and Software as well as any Student information you collect from such Sites and/or Software in accordance with our Privacy Policy and all applicable laws. You agree and acknowledge that you will not use the Sites or Software with any Student under 13 years old, unless you are an authorized representative of that Student’s LEA, with authority to consent to the collection use and disclosure of personal information from such Student.
        
        **Acceptable Use Policies.**
        
        You agree to use the Site in accordance with all applicable laws. Because MIND is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization, you agree that you will not use the Site for organized partisan political activities. You further agree that you will not post, upload, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through any Site, or through any other MIND computing resources:
        
        * Content that defames or threatens others
        * Statements that are bigoted, hateful or racially offensive
        * Content that discusses illegal activities with the intent to commit them
        * Content that infringes another’s intellectual property, including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets
        * Material that contains vulgar or obscene language or images
        * Advertising, promotional materials, or any form of commercial solicitation  
              
            
        
        You also may not:
        
        * harvest or otherwise collect personal information about users, including e-mail addresses, without their consent
            
        * use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, bots or other automated means to access or use the Sites
            
        * introduce or attempt to introduce software viruses, Trojan horses, worms, backdoors or any other computer codes, files, or programming instruction or set of instructions that are designed or intended to disrupt, disable, harm, interfere or otherwise adversely affect any computer programs, software, firmware, hardware, mobile devices, wireless devices, computer systems, data or operations.
            
2. ### 2\. Use of the Sites and Software.
    
    * **License from Us.**

You may not otherwise copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, commercially exploit or otherwise transfer any materials on the Site, including the Software. Any resale, redistribution, or publication of the Software or other contents on the Sites, or any modifications or derivative works, is prohibited.

Your compliance with the requirements in this paragraph is a condition to, and material inducement and consideration for, our granting you the right to download, access and use the Sites. Any unauthorized use or other activity by you in violation of these Terms of Use will cause the licenses granted to you under this Section 2 (Permission to Use the Sites) to terminate immediately and automatically. Nothing in these Terms of Use transfers or otherwise grants any ownership rights from us to you any intellectual property rights of MIND or any third party licensor; and all right, title and interest in, to and under any intellectual property rights in the Sites, Software, User Provided Materials, or other materials on the Sites will remain solely with the MIND Education, its affiliates or such third party, as applicable.
        
3. ### 3\. User Provided Content.
    
    * You may use the Site for legal purposes only. The Sites may contain content submitted by you or other users ("User Provided Materials").

9. ### 9\. Your Account.
    
    * If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, if any, and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of either your password(s) or account(s) or any other breach of security.

10. ### 10\. Termination of Use.
    
    * **Termination by LEA.**
        
        An LEA may terminate use of the Sites or Software by provision of written notice of termination to us, pursuant to the notice provisions set forth in Section 11 (General) below. We will terminate use and storage of any Student Records received from the LEA following written notice of termination, unless we have received consent directly from such Student, if aged 13 or above, or the Student’s parent or legal guardian otherwise, to store such Student Records.
        
        **Termination or Suspension by Us.**
        
        We may suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Sites or Services, or block or disable your access or use of the Apps, at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. Without limiting the foregoing, we may suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Sites or Services, or block or disable your access or use of the Apps if (a) we believe, in our sole discretion that you are in breach of this Agreement or are acting in a manner that shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to, comply with the Terms and Conditions; (b) we are required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); (c) we elect to no longer provide the Sites or Services to users in the state or country in which you are resident or from which you use the Sites or Services; (d) we believe that your use of the Sites or Services may infringe or violate the rights of a third party or subject us or one of our affiliates to civil or criminal liability or reputational harm; or (e) we believe such suspension or termination is necessary or appropriate to avoid harm to the Sites, Services, or persons; in each such a case, no portion of your subscription payment will be refunded. If we suspend or terminate your access for no reason or for a reason other than those set forth in the preceding sentence, we will refund to you any unused portion of your subscription payment, if any, which will be your sole and exclusive remedy upon such suspension or termination. Termination may result, in our sole discretion, in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account. All Terms and Conditions that by their nature should survive termination of this Agreement, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of liability, shall so survive. If your account is cancelled or terminated for any reason, you will no longer be able to access information under your account.
        
11. ### 11.General.
    
    * **Assignment.**
        
        You will not assign any of your rights and obligations under these Terms of Use without our prior written consent.

        **Severability.**
        
        If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be void or unenforceable, then the remainder will have full force and effect, and the invalid provision will be partially enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law to effectuate the purpose of these Terms of Use.
        
        **No Waiver.**
        
        No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the MIND Education's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
        
        **Mobile and Internet Usage.**
        
        By using the Sites from your mobile phone, you understand that your wireless or internet services provider’s standard SMS, MMS and/or data rates will apply to your use of the Sites. By using the Sites, you agree to be responsible for any fees that are incurred as a result of your use of the Sites. You hereby represent and warrant that you are the owner or authorized user of any mobile or other wireless device that you use to access the Services, and that you are authorized to approve all associated SMS, MMS and data charges.
        
        **Certain Third Party Terms.**
        
        You agree that, in addition to these Terms, your use of Apps may be subject to (a) the usage rules set forth in Amazon Appstore’s terms of use, Apple App Store’s terms of use, or Google Play’s terms of service, if you download Amazon Appstore, Apple App Store or Google Play, respectively; or (b) those of any other third party platform, developer or distributor end-user license agreement and/or terms and conditions by which you agree to be bound when you download or access the App.
        
        **Entire Agreement.**
        
        These Terms, including our Privacy Policy, together with any legal notices or other terms or conditions published on the Sites or in the Software, as applicable (including the Homeschooling EULA for those who have licensed such Software) constitute the entire agreement between you and MIND and its affiliates with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements.
        
        **Amendments.**
        
        We reserve the right to amend these Terms of Use at any time and any amendments, changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon notice of them.
