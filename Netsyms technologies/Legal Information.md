Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
-----------------------------------

tl;dr: We respect your privacy and just ask you be nice in return.

Last updated October 27, 2020 to adjust wording of the “Don’t sue us” section.

**This document applies to all Netsyms Technologies products and services.** This document should be considered our Terms of Service agreement. If a product or service specifies extra conditions, those also apply. If a product or service has conditions that contradict this document in part or in whole, the product-specific terms take precedence over this document. If you receive official correspondence from Netsyms Technologies directing you on additional terms and conditions, consider them part of this document. We will attempt to notify you via email of any major changes to this document.

**You have to agree to these to have an account with us.** If you don’t agree, immediately terminate use of all our services and products and contact us. We may be able to grant you an exception for your particular scenario. Otherwise, we will assist you in deleting your accounts and information.

**Some content is banned.** We don’t have to give you space on our servers if we don’t want to. If we find objectionable content, it will be removed. Examples of such content: pornography, hate speech, pro-abortion or pro-gay “marriage” propaganda, illegal or illicit activities, and questionable drug use. We may remove such content without warning, although we will usually give you an opportunity to retrieve it before it is permanently deleted. If you have doubts about your content falling foul of this clause, contact us and we will decide. You should also read [our beliefs](https://netsyms.com/beliefs). This applies to any content that passes through or resides on any of our servers.

**We only store the information essential to your use of our services.** We don’t like companies tracking us any more than you do. We only store data you give us, such as files you upload, data you submit in a form, pages you visit, and your computer’s IP address. You are allowed to use a pseudonym if you so choose; we only use your name as a “friendly” alternative to your username. We only retain data as needed to provide you with services. We never log historical location data; any such data we receive overwrites the older data. Under normal conditions, we keep server access logs no longer than one month. Netsyms services may store short-term or session cookies on your machine; these cookies allow you to log in and expire when no longer needed. Longer-term cookies may also be used for analytical purposes, so we can see how our services are being used. Analytical data does not move outside Netsyms servers, and you cannot be identified with it. If you don’t want to be tracked at all, enable Do-Not-Track in your web browser or [click here](https://netsyms.com/tracking-opt-out) to opt out. If you wish to have your personal information removed from our systems, you want a copy of your data, or you want to change your information but can’t find a way to do so, contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

**Your personal data is safe with us.** We will never sell your information to anybody. It belongs to you and you own it. Sometimes we do take a peek to make sure everything goes smoothly for all our users, but we never tell anyone what we find (unless we find something very illegal). We like to think we handle your data better than Google or Facebook.

**Source Code.** Netsyms <3 open source! Our services are open source unless there’s a very good reason (for example, something that isn’t ready yet). To browse or download source code, head over to [our Git server](https://source.netsyms.com/explore/repos).

**Online Services.** We are not responsible in any way for the activities of users on our online services. Please contact us if a user is affecting the well-being of the service or other people. Include all relevant information, detailing everything you can about the incident. You may also contact us for other issues regarding conduct. We may or may not reply, but appropriate action will be performed at our discretion. If you are misusing, abusing, or putting a large amount of strain on our systems, we will ask you to stop or to pay a small usage fee. If you disregard our requests, we reserve the right to terminate your account or otherwise block your access.

**Physical Services.** We do not offer a warranty on physical goods, except as required by law. We can try to contact the vendor we purchased the goods from for a refund or exchange. If we physically break your computer because we screwed up, we will fix that for free. You should always backup your data, even if there is no problem. Because of that, we offer no guarantee that your digital data will be intact, especially if we are installing an operating system or cleaning a virus infection. Again, keep backup copies of your important files.

**Don’t sue us.** We are not liable if bad stuff happens, even if it’s our software’s fault. Bugs happen. Or, in lawyer-speak: Netsyms Technologies’ digital products and services are provided by Netsyms, the copyright holders, and contributors “as is” and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall Netsyms, the copyright holders, or contributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of these digital products and services, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
