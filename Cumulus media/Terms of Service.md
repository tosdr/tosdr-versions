Additional Terms may cover Cumulus Internet Services, which appear on the pages where these services are available, in addition to the general terms provided below. The selection of available Cumulus Internet Services may change from time to time in Cumulus’s sole discretion. You may participate in the Cumulus Interactive Service by completing the registration form where one is provided.

In these Terms of Use, we use the word “Submissions” to mean text, messages, ideas, feedback, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, formats, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons’ names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute (collectively “Distribute”) on or through a Cumulus Site using the Cumulus Interactive Services.

We do not claim ownership of the Submissions you provide, post, upload, input or submit to any Cumulus Site using the Cumulus Interactive Services. However, by posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Submission to a Cumulus Site through the Cumulus Interactive Services, you are granting us and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, a perpetual, non‐exclusive, irrevocable, fully‐paid, royalty‐free, sub‐licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify, create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit such Submissions, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised (including on Cumulus Sites, Cumulus Interactive Services, on third‐party platforms, and on our radio stations) for any and all purposes including entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity (the “Submissions License”).

By Distributing a Submission, you represent and warrant that the Submission and your communication thereof conform to the provisions set forth below and to the other requirements of these Terms of Use, and that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents and permissions, without the need for any permission from or payment to any other person or entity, to exploit, and to authorize us to exploit, such Submission in all manners contemplated by these terms of use (including the Submissions License). Any violation of these provisions can subject your Cumulus account to immediate termination and, possibly, further legal action. These Terms of Use (including the Submissions License) are not limited by any past or future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers you may have made or make with respect to Submissions.

Other than those we specifically request, we do not accept or consider unsolicited creative materials, ideas or suggestions either via this Cumulus Site, email or other means. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or obtained independently. However, if you do still transmit to us, via this Cumulus Site, email or otherwise, any unsolicited communication or material, you will be deemed to have granted to us the same rights as are set out in this section with respect to Submissions. Without limitation thereof, you agree that Cumulus, our affiliates and our licensees are free to use any ideas, concepts, know‐how or techniques contained in any communication you send to us for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products, services and content using such information, without any credit, notice, approval or compensation to you.

### **REFERRAL PROGRAMS**

A Cumulus Site may offer referral programs that permit you to submit information about other persons (each, a “Referred Person”), including, without limitation, U.S.‐based email addresses, mobile telephone numbers, names, street addresses and other contact information so they may receive information and/or promotional offers concerning the Cumulus Internet Service. You may only refer persons with whom you have a personal relationship. You must have obtained the consent of the Referred Person prior to providing us with his or her contact information. We reserve the right to limit the number of Referred Persons you can submit. We reserve the right to limit the number of transmissions to any particular Referred Person from time to time.

In addition, we reserve the right to reject the participation of any Referred Person if (a) the contact information provided by you is incorrect or not valid, (b) such individual has violated any provision of these terms or conditions, or (c) we determine in our sole discretion that the participation of such individual might be harmful to us, this Cumulus Site, any Cumulus Internet Service, or any third party for any reason. We specifically disclaim any liability for exercising such right.

### **FEES**

Except where otherwise provided, access to and use of a Cumulus Site and the Cumulus Internet Services offered through it are currently available without charge. Cumulus reserves the right to charge a fee for access to or use of any Cumulus Site, or any Cumulus Internet Service available on this Cumulus Site at any time in the future.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Personal Information as well as for all of your activities on the Cumulus Sites and any related Cumulus Internet Service. You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us, our licensors, licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, and each of the foregoing entities’ respective resellers, distributors, service providers and suppliers, and all of the foregoing entities’ respective officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, insurers, representatives and assigns (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities and costs (including settlement costs and any legal or other fees and expenses for investigating or defending any actions or threatened actions) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach by you of this Agreement, the Additional Terms, or any warranty you provide herein, or otherwise arising in any way out of your use of the Cumulus Sites and any related Cumulus Internet Service and/or software.

Additionally, Cumulus shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to a Cumulus Internet Service.

### **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

To the maximum extent permitted by law, this Agreement and any Additional Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Georgia as it is applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such state, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of, or connected with, this Agreement and/or the Additional Terms, or in connection with any matters related to this Cumulus Site and/or the Privacy Policy, shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, exclusively in either the state or Federal courts located in Atlanta, Georgia. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Georgia for any cause of action arising out of this Agreement. You agree to file any cause of action with respect to this Agreement within one year after the cause of action arises. You agree that a cause of action filed after this date is barred.

If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid or for any reason, unenforceable including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, then such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches, as closely as possible, the original provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Cumulus with respect to the use of a Cumulus Site and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by an authorized representative of Cumulus.
