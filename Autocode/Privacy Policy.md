### Autocode

Autocode was started in 2016 as "standard library." It was shut down on April 26th, 2024.  
  
It reached over 750,000 users and was responsible for introducing tens of thousands of young developers to coding. I am grateful to the community, team and investors who made it all possible.  
  
Thank you,
