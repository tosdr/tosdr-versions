Each party agrees that this Agreement, and all data, software code, inventions, algorithms, know-how, methodology and ideas, and all other business, strategic, commercial, financial, technical and employee information that it obtains from the other party, are the confidential property of the disclosing party (“Confidential Information’’). Except as permitted herein, the receiving party will hold in confidence and not use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than the purposes anticipated by this Agreement. Further, a receiving party shall not disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information other than to those of its employees, contractors and advisors having a “need to know”, but only after they have been advised of its confidential and proprietary nature and have agreed to protect same on terms no less onerous than the terms set out in this Section

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL DMCA SERVICES BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR DIRECT DAMAGES GREATER THAN THE SUM TOTAL OF PAYMENTS MADE BY CUSTOMER FOR THE USE AND OCCUPANCY OF CUSTOMER'S SPACE OR IN THE CASE OF SPECIAL SERVICES, INCLUDING ENCODING SERVICES, THE SUM TOTAL OF PAYMENTS MADE BY CUSTOMER TO DMCA SERVICES FOR THE SERVICE FOR WHICH DAMAGES ARE CLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL DMCA SERVICES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF AND IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF ADVISED BEFORE HAND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL DMCA SERVICES BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY MARKETING, ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES OR ANY EXPENSES RELATED TO THE CUSTOMER'S USE OF DMCA SERVICES'S SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF ANY EVENT, INCLUDING INTERRUPTION OF DMCA SERVICES’S SERVICE OR REMOVAL OF CUSTOMER'S CONTENT.

The provisions of this Agreement will enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective heirs, executors, successors, permitted assigns, and personal representatives.
        4. Any consent by a party to, or waiver of, a breach by the other party, whether express or implied, shall not constitute consent to or a waiver of any other, different or subsequent breach.
        5. The Services are provided on a non-exclusive basis, and nothing contained herein shall prevent or restrict DMCA.com from providing the same or similar services to any other party, either during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter.
        6. The parties are independent contractors. Neither DMCA.com’s nor Customer’s officers, employees, contractors or agents shall be deemed to be the officers, employees, contractors or agents of the other, and DMCA.com shall not be subject to the day to day supervision or control of Customer. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to create any agency, joint venture or partnership between the parties, and neither DMCA.com nor Customer shall represent that its relationship with respect to the other party is other than that of an independent contractor.
        7. Any notice, communication or statement required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and deemed to have been sufficiently given when delivered in person, or by facsimile (with confirmation of facsimile transmission), email, or by certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, to the chief executive of the other party at the address set out at the head of this Agreement, or such other persons and/or addresses as either party may advise the other from time to time in accordance with this provision.
        8. DMCA.com will cooperate with any and all appropriate legal authorities in investigating claims of illegal activity, including, but not limited to illegal transfer or use of copyrighted material or other illegal activity. DMCA.com reserves the right to monitor or view material uploaded by Customer onto DMCA.com's service at any time for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this Agreement.
        9. Amendment of Agreement. DMCA.com may amend this Agreement from time to time on an as-needed basis by placing an update of this Agreement on-line at DMCA.com's web site at this location or at any other location designated at said site. Any changes to this Agreement take effect upon the renewal date of the Agreement. Therefore, it is Customer's responsibility to monitor this Agreement online. If Customer does not agree with the terms and conditions of DMCA.com, Customer must immediately cease the use of DMCA.com's service.
        10. Entire Agreement
            
            1. These Terms & Conditions, when read together with any Service Level Agreement (together, “this Agreement”), contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to DMCA Services’ provision of Services and supersede all prior agreements, proposals and communications between the parties, written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may only be modified in writing duly signed by authorized representatives of both parties. In no event shall preprinted terms and conditions on a Customer document (purchase order, confirmations, and acceptances) modify or add to the terms of this Agreement.
            2. DMCA Services may assign its rights under the Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. In the event of a breach of any provision of the Agreement by the Customer, DMCA Services’ failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any of the terms or conditions contained on this page are determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable term or condition will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable term or condition that matches the practical effect of the original provision as closely as possible.
