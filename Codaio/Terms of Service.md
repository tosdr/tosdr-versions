Terms of Service


====================

These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities with respect to your use of Coda’s mobile and/or web-based software platform (the “Coda Platform”) and related services (the “Services”). “You” or “your” or any variant thereof refers to you, if you are an individual entering into these Terms on your own behalf, or the entity or other organization that you represent in agreeing to these Terms. “Coda”, “We”, “our”, or “us” refers to Coda Project, Inc. (or its successors or assigns).

These Terms and any Order Form(s) (defined below) and any and all applicable supplemental terms incorporated by reference (including, without limitation, the

[Developer Terms](https://coda.io/trust/developer)

⁠

, the

[Packs Ecosystem Terms](http://coda.io/trust/packs)

⁠

) together form a binding “Agreement” between you and Coda. By signing up on behalf of your entity or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have all right, power, and authority to bind such entity or organization to the Agreement.

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 17.13 (THE “CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER”) AND A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 17.12 (THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”) THAT REQUIRES, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS IN SECTION 17.12, THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US, INCLUDING ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE YOU AGREED TO THESE TERMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS, AS WELL AS YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

By accessing or using the Services, or by clicking a button or checking a box marked “I Agree” (or similar), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, whether or not you are a registered user or customer of the Services. If you subscribe to, or access or use the Services, create a workspace, invite users to that workspace, or use or allow use of that workspace after being notified of a change to these Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Agreement and signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the Agreement on behalf of such organization. Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Agreement on behalf of yourself or the applicable entity or organization you represent before proceeding. We reserve the right to modify these Terms in our sole discretion.

Rights and Responsibilities of Coda.

Coda Platform. Coda will host and maintain the Coda Platform, on servers operated and maintained by or at the direction of Coda.

Right to Monitor. Coda will have the right to review and monitor all use of the Coda Platform to ensure compliance with the terms of the Agreement.

Your Responsibilities.

Set-Up. You will cooperate in setting up the Coda Platform as reasonably requested by Coda. You will maintain accurate and up-to-date account credentials and contact and notice information.

Access. You will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining, at your expense, all the necessary computer hardware, software, modems, connections to the internet and other items required to access the Coda Platform.

Account. Your account to access the Services (your “Account”) gives you access to the Services and other functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of Accounts for different types of users, which may include Accounts for free use of the Services or Accounts for paid aspects of the Services. Details of these types of Accounts are set forth on our pricing page (located

[here](http://coda.io/pricing)

⁠

). By connecting to Coda via a third-party service (e.g., Google, Apple, or Microsoft sign-in), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service, as permitted by that service, and to store your account and log-in credentials for that service.

When creating your Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and you must keep your Account password secure. You are responsible for all credentials (including usernames and passwords) for all your Accounts, including administrator Accounts and Accounts of your Authorized Users (as defined below). We encourage you to use “strong” passwords with your Accounts. You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. We will not be liable or responsible for any losses, damages, or liability caused by any unauthorized use of your Account.

Managing Settings. You may control your profile and how you interact with the Services by changing the settings in your Account. By providing us with your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Services-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including updates regarding features of the Services, special offers, and other marketing messages. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your Account. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

General Provisions

Subscriptions. A subscription allows you and your Authorized Users to access the Services. A subscription may be procured through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between you and Coda (each, an “Order Form”). Subscriptions commence when we make the Services available to you and continue for the term set forth in the Services interface (typically located in your Account page or dashboard) or as set forth in the Order Form, as applicable (the “Subscription Period”).

Developmental Offerings. From time to time, we may look for testers to help us test and trial our developmental products, services, updates, or features. Any of the foregoing will be identified as “beta” or “pre-release,” or words or phrases with similar meanings (each, a “Developmental Offering”). Developmental Offerings are made available on an “as is,” and “as available" basis and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, without any warranties or contractual commitments. You are not required to participate in testing or trialing any Developmental Offerings, and you do so at your own discretion and risk.

Feedback. You and your Authorized Users may choose to, or we may invite you and them to, submit comments, feedback, or ideas about the Services, including without limitation, about how to improve the Services or any of our other products (“Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that such disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited, and without restriction and will not place us under any fiduciary or other obligations, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation, whether to you, any Authorized User, or anyone else, and we are free to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of the Feedback, we do not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to us, or developed by our personnel, or obtained from sources other than you or your Authorized Users.

Changes to the Services. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that we may modify or discontinue all or any part of the Services, temporarily or permanently, including, without limitation, any programs, platforms, tools, marketplace, galleries, or extensions, that we make available in connection therewith, including, for example, termination or suspension of access to and use of the Developer Platform and our Referral Program, at any time and for any reason, with or without prior notice. Upon such termination or suspension for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by the Agreement.

Disputes with Other Parties. You are solely responsible for your interactions with our other users, developers, partners, and their authorized users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor and moderate disputes between you and other users and participants on the Services. We shall have no liability for such interactions, or for any action or inaction of another user, developer, partner, and their authorized users.

Access to the Coda Platform.

Our License to You. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, during the applicable Subscription Period, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, freely revocable license to access and use, and to permit your Authorized Users to access and use, the Services for your own internal business purposes. We may terminate this license at any time at our discretion. For Purposes of the Agreement, “Authorized User” means an individual authorized by you to access the Services. Upon written notice to Coda, you may permit your Affiliates to use the Coda Platform, in which case the Affiliate will be considered an Authorized User hereunder. You are responsible for all of the acts or omissions of your Authorized Users, and any Affiliates and its and their respective Authorized Users. For purposes of the Agreement, “Affiliate” means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you, where “control” means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise, to use the Coda Platform. You must comply with the Agreement and ensure that your Authorized Users comply with the Agreement. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so. The Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 13. You must ensure that all Authorized Users are over 13 years old. You will (a) inform Authorized Users of all relevant policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of User Content (as defined below); and (b) obtain all rights, permissions or consents from Authorized Users and any personnel that are necessary to grant the rights and licenses in the Agreement and for the lawful use and transmission of User Content and the operation of the Services. Each Authorized User must have its own unique user account and may not share its user account with any other person.

To the extent that we may make other software, software components or other tools available, via a marketplace, gallery, stores or other channels, as part of the Services, we grant to you a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, limited license for you and your Authorized Users to use the object code version of these components, but solely as necessary to use the Services and in accordance with the Agreement. All of our rights not expressly granted by this license are hereby retained.

Use Restrictions. Except to the extent expressly permitted in the Agreement, you and your Authorized Users will not, and will not permit any third party to: (i) use the Coda Platform; (ii) modify or create any derivative work of any part of the Coda Platform; (iii) market, sublicense, publish, distribute, reproduce, assign, transfer, rent, lease or loan the Coda Platform; (iv) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise determine or attempt to determine source code (or the underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organization) of any object code contained in the Coda Platform; or (v) use the Coda Platform for commercial time-sharing or service bureau use.

Reservation of Rights. We own and will continue to own the Services, including all related intellectual property and other proprietary rights related to the Services. Coda reserves all rights to the Coda Platform not otherwise expressly granted in this Section 4.

Coda AI. As part of the Coda Platform, you may have access to features and functionality that make use of artificial intelligence, machine-learning, or other similar technologies (the “AI Functions”). Your access to and use of the AI Functions is governed by the

[AI Addendum](https://coda.io/@documentation/ai-addendum)

⁠

.

User Content

License to User Content. In connection with your use of the Coda Platform, you and your Authorized Users may upload and/or create certain content to and through the Coda Platform, including videos, images, music, comments, questions, documents, spreadsheets, and any other content submitted, posted, displayed, provided or otherwise made available by you and your Authorized Users through the Services (“User Content”). User Content may also contain information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular natural person (such information, “Personal Data”). As between Coda and you, you own and retain any and all rights to User Content and no ownership rights are transferred to Coda under the Agreement. You hereby grant, and represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant (including, without limitation, any necessary consents and authorizations from individual persons identified in the User Content and licenses from third-parties whose content is included in the User Content), to Coda a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use, host, process, store, reproduce, analyze, transmit, archive, modify, publish, list information regarding, translate, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with Coda’s provision of the Services and as otherwise described hereunder.

Your Responsibilities for User Content. We are not responsible for any User Content or the way you or your Authorized Users choose to use the Services to store or process any User Content, and you acknowledge and agree that Coda is acting only as a passive conduit for your and your Authorized Users’ online distribution of such User Content. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained and/or created the User Content lawfully, and the User Content does not and will not violate any applicable laws or any person’s or entity's proprietary or intellectual property rights; (ii) the User Content is free of all viruses, Trojan horses, and other elements that could interrupt or harm the Coda Platform; (iii) you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all privacy laws in all jurisdictions that may apply to User Content provided hereunder; (iv) Coda may host, use, process, transmit, and otherwise exercise any license and rights to User Content granted hereunder without liability or cost to any third party; and (v) the User Content complies with the terms of Coda’s publishing and acceptable use policies. If we believe there is a violation of the Agreement that can be remedied by your removal of certain User Content, we will, in most cases, ask you to take direct action rather than intervene. However, to the extent legally permissible, we reserve the right to take further appropriate action when we deem it reasonably appropriate, including, if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, other users, or any third parties. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, you should not submit any User Content that includes a social security number, passport numbers, driver’s license number, or similar identifier, credit card or debit card number, or any other information which may be subject to specific or restrictive and heightened privacy and security laws including, without limitation, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HiTECH), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not make any representations as to the adequacy of the Service to process User Content or to satisfy any legal or compliance requirements which may apply to User Content, other than as expressly described herein.

Account and Usage Data. User Content does not include log-in credentials, billing information and other User account information processed in connection with providing the Coda Platform and Services (“Account Data”), nor does User Content include usage data, analytics, error resolution data, or any other data relating to the operation, use and/or performance of the Coda Platform (“Usage Data”). Account Data, which may include Personal Data, and Usage Data is processed by Coda in accordance with its Privacy Statement which is currently located at

[https://coda.io/trust/privacy.](https://coda.io/trust/privacy)

⁠

⁠

Publishing. From time to time, you or your Authorized Users may, in your or their sole discretion, elect to make certain User Content publicly available on the Coda Platform, including in the form of published documents, templates, websites, forms, and surveys (collectively, “Published Content”). Any Published Content must comply with Coda’s Publishing Policies (currently available at

[https://coda.io/publishing-policies](https://coda.io/publishing-policies)

⁠

). With respect to Published Content, you hereby grant to Coda a perpetual, irrevocable, fully transferable and sublicensable (through multiple tiers), worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license: (i) to reproduce, electronically distribute, transmit, have transmitted, perform, display, store, and archive any Published Content; and (ii) to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell, import, and otherwise distribute any such Published Content under all applicable laws and to permit others to do the same.

Security. Coda will maintain appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of User Content in accordance with the Coda Security Annex made available at

[http://coda.io/trust/securityannex](http://coda.io/trust/securityannex)

⁠

(“Coda Security Annex”).

Data Processing Addendum. To the extent that: (i) User Content contains any Personal Data that is subject to Applicable Data Protection Laws (including the GDPR, UK Data Protection Laws, or the CCPA) and (ii) Coda Processes such Personal Data on your behalf, the provisions of the

[Data Processing Addendum](https://coda.io/trust/dpa)

⁠

(“DPA”) shall apply to the Processing of such Personal Data. For the purposes of this Section 5.6, the terms “Personal Data”, “Process”, “Applicable Data Protection Laws”, “GDPR”, “UK Data Protection Laws” and “CCPA” have the meanings given to them in the DPA.

[https://coda.io/publishing-policies](https://coda.io/publishing-policies)

⁠

, as may be amended from time to time, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Technical Restrictions. You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Services in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Services in a manner that sends more request messages to the servers hosting the Services than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser; (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Services; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose in our sole determination an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Services; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Services; (viii) using the Services for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Services; (xi) accessing any content on the Services through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Services; (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Services, including without limitation, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Services or the content therein; or (xiii) removing any proprietary notices or labels from the Services.

Accessing any audiovisual content that may be available on the Services for any purpose or in any manner other than Streaming is expressly prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the functionality of the Services. “Streaming” means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Services to an Authorized User’s device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the Authorized User.

User Content Restrictions. You agree not to submit any User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (viii) contains any information or content that you know is misleading, incorrect or not current; or (ix) to the extent applicable, violates any school or other applicable policy, including those related to cheating or ethics.

You agree that any User Content that you or your Authorized Users post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any intellectual property rights or rights of privacy. To the extent that User Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including without limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the power to grant the license granted below. To the extent legally permissible, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates any of these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Services is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.

Open Source Software. The Services make use of components subject to the terms and conditions of "open source" software (“OSS”) licenses; see

[Open Source Licenses](https://coda.io/trust/oss)

⁠

for more details. In addition, certain code distributed in and as part of the Platform may be licensed under or include components subject to OSS licenses. If applicable, we will identify any OSS included or distributed in, through, or as part of the Platform. Such OSS licenses may grant you additional rights to the OSS code itself and allow you to use the OSS outside of the Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any use of OSS as part of the Platform must be in compliance with the Agreement (including the

[Developer Guidelines](https://coda.io/developers/apis/v1)

⁠

).

Payment Obligations; Taxes

Payment Terms. If you purchase a subscription to use the Services, fees are specified through the Services interface or in the Order Form(s) and must be paid in advance. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in the Agreement, fees paid are non-refundable. For clarity, in the event you downgrade any subscriptions from a paid plan to a free plan, you will remain responsible for any unpaid fees under the paid plan, and Services under the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscription term. If we agree to invoice you, full payment must be received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Overdue payments will be subject to interest at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the maximum allowable under applicable law, whichever is less.

Taxes. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income.

Billing Policies. If you elect to purchase a subscription to use our Services, or certain other paid aspects of the Services, you agree to the pricing communicated to you by us in the Order Form(s) or otherwise as part of the Services. Coda may add new services for additional fees and charges, or add or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in Coda’s sole discretion, by giving you at least 30 days' written notice (to the extent applicable), such increase to take effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle. In certain circumstances, we may be required to modify fees based on direction from a third party, in which case, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you within such period. If you do not wish to accept the price increase, you may give notice to terminate the Agreement, by giving at least 30 days' written notice to us, such notice to expire no later than the end of the then-current billing cycle. The fees will not increase during the notice period; otherwise, any change to such pricing shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change as provided under the Agreement. If pricing is communicated to you through an Order Form, Subscription Fees are subject to change upon the first day of each Renewal Period. The access granted in the Agreement will not extend to the use of the Coda Platform beyond the specific programs or modules, or number of User Seats, authorized and paid for in accordance with the Services interface, Order Form or added in connection with True Ups. Coda reserves the right to limit, suspend, disable access to, or terminate, in part or in whole, your Account or your documents, or bill you for additional fees, in the event that you are (or are reasonably suspected of) abusing, misusing, exploiting, or otherwise circumventing any billing or pricing policy mechanics or features or functionality of the Coda Platform (including with respect to free or unpaid accounts, evaluations, trials, betas, account credits, or Maker billing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, billing of Packs purchased through the Services are governed by the

[Packs Ecosystem Terms](http://coda.io/trust/packs)

⁠

.

Payment Information. To the extent we offer any Services for a fee or other payment, you represent and warrant that: (a) any account, order, and payment method information you supply to us or our service provider(s), as applicable, is true, correct, and complete; (b) you are duly authorized to use such payment method; (c) you will pay any charges that you incur in connection with the Services, including any applicable taxes; (d) charges incurred by you will be honored by your payment method company; (e) you will pay all charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any; (f) you will not allow anyone else to use your subscription; (g) you will not transfer your subscription or password to anyone else; and (h) you will report to us any unauthorized or prohibited access or use of your subscription or password.

If any of your account, order, or payment method information changes, you agree to promptly update this information, so that we or our service provider(s) may complete your transactions and contact you as needed.

Any notice of cancellation must be submitted on your account page or in writing and sent to support@coda.io and will be effective for the following Subscription Period. You acknowledge and agree that unless and until you notify Coda of your non-renewal or cancelation, your subscription and all corresponding fees will automatically renew and you authorize Coda (or Coda’s third-party payment provider) to charge you the applicable subscription fees, using any eligible payment method that Coda has on record for you, without any further notice to you, unless required by applicable law.

Additional Terms for Particular Types of Users

U.S. Government. If you are a U.S. government or U.S. public entity (or use of the Services is for the U.S. Government), the terms in this section apply.

Use By or For the U.S. Government. The Services are a “commercial item,” as defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, and constitute “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202 to §227.7204. This commercial computer software is provided to end users for use, by and on behalf of the U.S. Government, with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein.

Indemnification, Auto-Renewal, Venue, Legal Fees: The sections in the Agreement titled “Governing Law; Venue,” Term; Renewal,” “Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver,” and “Indemnification” are hereby waived to the extent they are inconsistent with federal law.

No Endorsement: We agree that your seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that you may have a presence on our Services, will not be used by us in such a manner as to state or imply that our products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by you or by any other element of the U.S. Government, or are considered by you or the U.S. Government to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages which design and content are under the control of you, or for links to or promotion of such pages, we agree not to display any of your government seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on our homepage or elsewhere on one of our hosted sites unless permission to do so has been granted by you or by other relevant federal government authority. We may list your name in a publicly available customer list or elsewhere so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third party name.

State or Local Government Users. If you are a state or local government, the terms in this section apply, but only to the extent the Services are being used in an Authorized User’s official capacity as a state or local government official. The sections in the Agreement titled “Governing Law; Venue,” “Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver” and “Indemnification” will not apply to you only to the extent your jurisdiction’s laws prohibit you from accepting the requirements in those sections.

Healthcare Users. If you are a "Covered Entity” as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and related amendments and regulations as updated or replaced (“HIPAA”), unless you have entered into a written agreement with us to the contrary, you acknowledge that we are not a Business Associate or subcontractor (as defined in HIPAA) and that the Services are not HIPAA compliant. You must not submit, collect or use any “personal health information” as defined in 45 CFR §160.103 (“PHI”), with or to the Services. Further, we suggest that you advise your Authorized Users directly that they should not transmit PHI through the Services. You agree that we have no liability for PHI received from you or your Authorized Users, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and you shall indemnify us with respect to any claims related to any PHI or HIPAA to the extent that you have violated the terms of this section.

Education Professional Users. If you are a school or educator in the United States and want your students, who are over the age of 13, to use the Services, you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) and all other law, rules, and regulations protecting the privacy of student data which may be applicable to you. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, you may not submit Personal Data which contains personal information from a student’s educational record, as defined by FERPA. You are responsible for obtaining all necessary consents, if applicable, before permitting your Authorized Users, including any students, to submit information through the Services.

U.S. Export Restrictions. The Services may be subject to export restrictions by the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments, and you agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations in your use thereof. You and your Authorized Users shall not (and shall not allow any third party to) remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Services or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons, Entity or Unverified Lists or the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Consolidated Sanctions list (collectively, “Prohibited Persons”); (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority. You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in, under the control of or a national or resident of any such prohibited country and (ii) you are not a Prohibited Person nor owned, controlled by or acting on behalf of a Prohibited Person. You agree not to use the Services for any prohibited end use, including to support any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons proliferation, or missile technology, without the prior permission of the United States government.

Confidentiality

Confidential Information. From time to time during the Term, either party may disclose information to the other, which, (i) if in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form is marked “Confidential” or “Proprietary” or which, if disclosed orally or by demonstration, is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential and reduced to a writing marked “Confidential” and delivered to the receiving party within thirty (30) days of such disclosure; or (ii) by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as confidential (collectively, the “Confidential Information”). Notwithstanding any failure to so identify them, all technology or proprietary information underlying the Coda Platform will be deemed Confidential Information of Coda, and the User Content will be deemed your Confidential Information.

Nondisclosure. Each party (each a “Receiving Party”) agrees that it will use and reproduce the Confidential Information of the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) only for purposes of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under the Agreement; will restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party’s employees, consultants, or advisors who have a need to know; and will not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party. The foregoing obligations will be satisfied by the Receiving Party through the exercise of at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of its own information of like importance, but not less than reasonable care. All third parties to whom the Receiving Party discloses Confidential Information must be bound by obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as protective of such information as the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it will not be a breach of the Agreement for the Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information if compelled to do so under law, in a judicial or other governmental investigation or proceeding; provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prior notice to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to and/or limit the judicial or governmental requirement to disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to access or disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing access to such Confidential Information as well as the reasonable cost for any support provided in connection with the Disclosing Party seeking a protective order or confidential treatment for the Confidential Information to be produced.

Exceptions. Confidential Information excludes information that: (i) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of the Receiving Party; (ii) was known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of disclosure; (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party; (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Confidential Information, as demonstrated by files created at the time of such independent development; (v) becomes known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, from a source other than the Disclosing Party without breach of the Agreement by the Receiving Party and otherwise not in violation of the Disclosing Party’s rights; or (vi) is disclosed generally to third parties by the Disclosing Party without restrictions similar to those contained in the Agreement.

Limitation of Liability.

MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL CODA’S OR CODA’S AFFILIATES’, AGENTS’, DIRECTORS’, EMPLOYEES’, CONTRACTORS’, SUPPLIERS’ OR LICENSORS’ (COLLECTIVELY, “CODA REPRESENTATIVES”) AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY) EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU HEREUNDER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE LAST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY AND (B) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100). THE FOREGOING WILL NOT LIMIT YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 7 ABOVE.

EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL CODA OR ANY CODA REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS BASED UPON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU OR THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CODA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICES, ANY USER’S ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.

CODA ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM USER’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES; (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF CODA’S SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL DATA STORED THEREIN; (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE PLATFORM OR OTHER SERVICES; (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE SERVICES OR OTHER SERVICES OR PACKS BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES; AND (VII) USER CONTENT OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

EXCLUSIONS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF WARRANTIES OR DAMAGES, SUCH AS INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE AGREEMENT GRANTS SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU AND YOUR AUTHORIZED USERS MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. The provisions of this “Limitation of Liability” section allocate the risks under the Agreement between the parties, and the parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into the Agreement and the pricing for the Services.

Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Coda and all Coda Representatives from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, damages, settlements, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (a) you and your Authorized Users’ use of and access to the Services or Third Party Packs, including any User Content or other content transmitted or received by you or your Authorized Users; (b) your violation or alleged violation of any term of the Agreement, including without limitation any breach of your representations and warranties herein; (c) your or any of your Authorized Users’ violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (d) your or any of your Authorized Users’ violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (e) User Content or any content that is submitted via your or any of your Authorized Users’ accounts, including without limitation misleading, false, or inaccurate information; (f) your or any of your Authorized Users’ gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct; (g) any other party’s access and use of the Services with your or any of your Authorized Users’ unique usernames, passwords or other appropriate security codes (provided that such access and use was not solely and specifically Coda’s fault). Coda may, at its own expense, participate in the defense and settlement of any claim with its own counsel, and you agree that you shall not settle a claim without Coda’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

Miscellaneous

Relationship of the Parties; No Third Party Beneficiaries The parties hereto are independent contractors and will have no right to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other party. Neither party will hold itself out as an agent of the other party. The Agreement will not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency, joint venture or formal business entity of any kind. There are no third party beneficiaries to the Agreement; a person who is not a party to the Agreement may not enforce any of its terms under any applicable law.

Assignment. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer any of your rights or obligations under the Agreement without our prior written consent. Coda may assign, sublicense, delegate, subcontract or otherwise transfer any of our rights or obligations under the Agreement without restriction.

[Developer Terms](https://coda.io/trust/developer)

⁠

)), so you should review such terms periodically. When we make material modifications to the Agreement, we will update the ‘Last Modified’ date at the bottom of these Terms and notify you that material changes have been made. Your continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of any new terms and the Agreement. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future modifications to the Agreement, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Services.

Force Majeure. We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations on account of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third party hosting provider or utility provider, acts of God, pandemics, acts of civil or military authorities, riots or civil disobedience, wars, strikes or labor disputes.

Third Party Products, Links, and Information. The Services may integrate with, or contain, third party products, services, materials, or information, or links thereto that are not owned or controlled by us (“Third Party Materials”). We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such Third Party Materials. If you or any Authorized Users access any third party website or service, you do so at your own risk, and you acknowledge and agree that the Agreement and our

[Privacy Statement](https://coda.io/trust/privacy)

⁠

do not apply to your or any Authorized User’s use of such sites or services. You expressly relieve us from any and all liability arising from you or your Authorized User’s use of any Third Party Materials.

Entire Agreement. The Agreement, including these Terms and all referenced pages and Order Forms, if applicable, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agreement supersedes the terms of any online agreement electronically accepted by you or your Authorized Users. However, to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these Terms and any other documents or pages referenced in these Terms, the following order of precedence will apply: (1) the

[Data Processing Addendum](https://coda.io/trust/dpa)

⁠

; (2) the terms of any Order Form (if any), (3) the Terms and (4) any other documents or pages referenced in the Terms. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, no terms or conditions stated in a purchase order, vendor onboarding process or web portal, or any other order documentation (excluding Order Forms) providing or originating from your or your Authorized Users will be incorporated into or form any part of the Agreement, and all such terms or conditions will be null and void.

Publicity. You hereby grant Coda the license and right to use your name, logo, and other trademarks (and those of the entities which you represent) for marketing, reference, or promotional purposes on Coda’s website and in other communications with Coda’s existing or prospective customers and otherwise to promote the Services, subject to any standard trademark or brand usage guidelines that you may provide to Coda from time to time. In the event that you do not wish to have any of the foregoing used by Coda in such manner, you may contact Coda at

[ip@coda.io](mailto:ip@coda.io)

⁠

stating that you do not wish to be used as a reference customer.

Professional Services. From time to time, you may request that Coda provide professional services, including integration and/or customization services in connection with the Coda Platform (“Professional Services”). If we agree to proceed with requested Professional Services, we shall set forth the specific terms and fees for such Professional Services in a statement of work (“SOW”). Upon your payment of fees due under the applicable SOW and/or applicable Order Form, we hereby grant to you, during the Subscription Period, a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to copy, maintain, use, and run (as applicable) any deliverables prepared by us and delivered to you under the applicable SOW solely for your internal business purposes associated with your use of the Coda Platform. Neither party shall have any obligation to engage in or perform any Professional Services contemplated in a SOW until such SOW is executed by an authorized representative of each party.

Case Study. In the event that we mutually agree for you to participate in a Coda case study, you agree to meet with us to provide your reviews, feedback, survey results, testimonials, soundbites, and other reasonably requested content to enable us to produce a case study that details your experience with Coda and the Coda Platform (a “Case Study”). You shall use commercially reasonable efforts and provide all requested information to allow us to publish the case study no later than sixty (60 days) following entry into the Agreement, or as may be otherwise agreed between the parties. You will have the opportunity to review the final Case Study prior to our publication thereof. Notwithstanding Section 17.8 above, you grant permission to use the Case Study, authorize us to use your logo and trademarks in connection with the Case Study and agree that the Case Study may be published by us on Coda’s website and publicly shared by us in other formats. Unless otherwise agreed by us, if you do not ultimately participate in a Case Study, we shall not be required to honor any benefits or discounts associated therewith.

Governing Law; Venue. The Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of conflict or choice-of-law rules. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York, which courts will adjudicate any dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement or its formation, interpretation or enforcement, including any appeal of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings if the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable, and any action for which Coda retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a Coda’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. The rights and obligations of the parties under the Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The parties acknowledge that the Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, with respect to the substantive law of the Agreement, any arbitration conducted hereunder (including the Arbitration Agreement in Section 12) shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) and shall preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence.

Arbitration of Disputes. Read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you may seek relief from us. The Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Coda that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) the Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arise or are asserted before or after your agreement to the Agreement.

If you are a new user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting the Agreement by emailing Coda at

[help@coda.io](mailto:help@coda.io)

⁠

with your (or the individual’s entering into the Agreement on behalf of you) first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of the Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought. For any Claim, you agree to first contact Coda at help@coda.io and attempt to resolve the dispute with us in an informal manner. If the parties have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, the parties agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), which arbitration shall be administered by JAMS conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the date of acceptance of these Terms, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or New York, unless you and Coda agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) you may be required to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Coda agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed as: preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the “Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver” section is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS CODA AGREES OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON USER’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHETHER IT RESULTS IN PROCEEDINGS IN ANY COURT IN ANY JURISDICTION OR IN ARBITRATION, THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL, WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY, AND AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL MATTERS SHALL BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE OR ARBITRATOR WITHOUT A JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. To the extent applicable, in the event of any lawsuit between the parties arising out of or related to the Agreement, the parties agree to prepare and to timely file in the applicable court a mutual consent to waive any statutory or other requirements for a trial by jury. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees.

Severability. The Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Except as otherwise stated in the Arbitration Agreement, if any provision of the Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction invalid or unenforceable, it will be replaced with the valid provision that most closely reflects the intent of the parties and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

Waivers. No delay or failure by either party to exercise any right or remedy under the Agreement will constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. All waivers must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party waiving its rights. A waiver by any party of any breach or covenant will not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of any other covenant.

Interpretation. The headings of the sections and paragraphs contained in the Agreement are inserted for convenience and are not intended to be part of or to affect the interpretation of the Agreement. The term “including” will be deemed to mean “including, without limitation.”

Additional Terms for Mobile Applications.

Mobile Applications. We may make available software to access the Services via a mobile device (which, for simplicity, shall include tablets or other devices which make use of the mobile application) (“Mobile Applications”). To use any Mobile Applications, you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Applications. We do not warrant that the Mobile Applications will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Applications and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Applications for one Account on mobile devices owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Applications, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Applications to any third party or use the Mobile Applications to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Applications; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Applications, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Applications, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Applications; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Applications. You acknowledge that we may, from time to time, provide updated versions of the Mobile Applications, and may automatically electronically update the version of the Mobile Applications that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic updating on your mobile device, and agree that the Agreement will apply to all such updates. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Applications is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Applications or any copy thereof, and we or our third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Applications (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in the Agreement, is void. We reserve all rights not expressly granted under the Agreement. If the Mobile Applications are being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. The Mobile Applications will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Services and any accompanying documentation by the United States Government will be governed solely by the Agreement and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the Agreement. The Mobile Applications originate in the United States, and are subject to United States export laws and regulations. The Mobile Applications may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or to those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile Applications may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Applications and the Services.

Mobile Applications from Apple App Store. The following applies to any Mobile Applications acquired from the Apple App Store (“Apple-Sourced Software”): you acknowledge and agree that the Agreement is solely between you and Coda, not Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) and that Apple has no responsibility for the Apple-Sourced Software or content thereof. Your use of the Apple-Sourced Software must comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Apple-Sourced Software. In the event of any failure of the Apple-Sourced Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Apple-Sourced Software (if any); to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apple-Sourced Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by the Agreement and any law applicable to us as provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and/or use of the Apple-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Apple-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed solely by the Agreement and any law applicable to us as provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and use of that Apple-Sourced Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, we, and not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by the Agreement. You and we acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of the Agreement as relates to your license of the Apple-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Agreement as relates to your license of the Apple-Sourced Software against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

Mobile Applications from Google Play Store. The following applies to any Mobile Applications you acquire from the Google Play Store (“Google-Sourced Software”): (i) you acknowledge that the Agreement is between you and Coda only, and not with Google, Inc. (“Google”); (ii) your use of Google-Sourced Software must comply with Google’s then-current Google Play Store Terms of Service; (iii) Google is only a provider of the Google Play Store where you obtained the Google-Sourced Software; (iv) Coda, and not Google, is solely responsible for its Google-Sourced Software; (v) Google has no obligation or liability to you with respect to Google-Sourced Software or the Agreement; and (vi) you acknowledge and agree that Google is a third-party beneficiary to the Agreement as it relates to our Google-Sourced Software.
