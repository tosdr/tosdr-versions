Legal Basis for Processing your Personal information (for European Residents Only)

If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, note that we will only process your personal information if we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis on which we rely depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Generally, we rely on the following legal bases:

Contractual necessity. We process your personal information as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the information to enter into or perform a contract with you, such as to provide you with the Services, process your payment, or respond to your request. When we process your information due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such information will mean you cannot use some or all portions of the Services.

Legal obligations, or vital or public interests. From time to time we may also need to process personal information to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other individuals, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.

Legitimate interests.

to contact you and respond to your requests and inquiries;

for business administration, including statistical analysis;

to maintain, customize and improve the Services;

to promote Coda and the Services;

to protect Coda's interests and rights; and

for fraud prevention and detection and to secure our Services.

Consent. We may also process your personal data on the basis of your freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent. When we process personal information based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.

For information about choices that you may have about the information collection and use described in this Section, see the “Your Rights and Choices” Section below.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we may either delete or anonymize your personal information.
