Legal Basis for Processing your Personal information (for European Residents Only)

The legal basis on which we rely depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Generally, we rely on the following legal bases:

Contractual necessity. We process your personal information as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the information to enter into or perform a contract with you, such as to provide you with the Services, process your payment, or respond to your request. When we process your information due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such information will mean you cannot use some or all portions of the Services.

Legal obligations, or vital or public interests. From time to time we may also need to process personal information to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other individuals, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.

for business administration, including statistical analysis;

to maintain, customize and improve the Services;

to promote Coda and the Services;

to protect Coda's interests and rights; and

for fraud prevention and detection and to secure our Services.

Consent. We may also process your personal data on the basis of your freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent. When we process personal information based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.

For information about choices that you may have about the information collection and use described in this Section, see the “Your Rights and Choices” Section below.

Data Protection

We maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to help protect personal information that we collect, but we do not guarantee that personal information will be completely protected. For example, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Any transmission of personal information by you is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services, including the illegal acts of third parties (such as criminal hacking).

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. For example, it is important to keep your password for your account for the Services confidential. We also recommend that you log out of the Services when you are done using it. If you believe that any account credentials for the Services have been compromised, please contact us immediately at

Data Storage and International Transfer

Your information may be transferred, stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Coda or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities, which may not offer the same level of protection of personal information as your country of residence. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

If you are located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or United Kingdom, please note that these safeguards include implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses with our group companies and applicable partners, or vendors and users.

Data Retention

We tend to keep personal information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to operate the Services, for the security of the Services, to comply with your requests, or comply with applicable law) and for a period consistent with the purposes for which we have collected the information. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we may either delete or anonymize your personal information. If it is not possible to delete or anonymize your information (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information until we can safely delete or anonymize such information., or as otherwise required to operate the Service, comply with your requests, or comply with applicable law.

The Services are not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian of a child and believe that your child may have provided us with personal information, please contact us at
