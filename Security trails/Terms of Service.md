**INTRODUCTION**

These Terms of Use set out the terms and conditions that govern the access and use of certain Services available on or through websites of Recorded Future by you. You should read this Agreement carefully.

By indicating acceptance of this Agreement, or by otherwise using the Service, or the Recorded Future website, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with the relevant Recorded Future entity (and you hereby represent that you are of legal age, and are otherwise fully able and competent, to enter into a binding agreement). If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the right and authority to bind such organization to this Agreement, and for clarity, the terms “Customer” and “you” will include both you, the individual user, and such organization. If you do not agree to be bound by these terms and conditions, you must not use the Service or the Recorded Future website.

Recorded Future offers, and the Service may include, both paid services and services which are free of charge. You agree your purchase and/or use of the Service is not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Recorded Future or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the offerings which Recorded Future provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. Changes to the form and nature of such offerings will be effective with respect to all versions of the Service. Any new features that may be added to Recorded Future’s websites, or the Service from time to time will be subject to this Agreement, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SERVICES OR SITES MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES, TERMS, OR RULES, WHICH WILL BE POSTED ON THE SERVICE OR SITES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH FEATURES. TO THE EXTENT SUCH TERMS, GUIDELINES, AND RULES CONFLICT WITH THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH TERMS SHALL GOVERN SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FEATURES. IN ALL OTHER SITUATIONS, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN.

**1\. SCOPE OF USE; OTHER AGREEMENTS.** (A) Customer’s access and use of the Service, its Output, and Documentation shall be limited to solely its own internal security purposes, and shall otherwise be subject to and in compliance with all the terms and conditions herein.

Such access and use of the Service is also restricted by and subject to further conditions in any Other Agreement, including any subscription fee(s), subscription term, scope of use, or other limitations, restrictions or obligations applicable to Customer therein. These restrictions may include a set number of Analyses daily, in the event Order Form states limits on the number of Analyses.

As also noted herein, access and use of the Service may require an active paid subscription pursuant to an Other Agreement. Further, for those Customers using a free version of the Service (such as through DNS-Trails), the associated license is strictly limited to Customer’s internal, non-commercial security purposes.

(B) Notwithstanding anything else herein, this Agreement does not provide any rights to Customer, including any right to access or use the Service, but for clarity does impose obligations on Customer.

**2\. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION.** (A) To the extent Customer materially breaches this Agreement or any Other Agreement, or Recorded Future believes in good faith that Customer has done so or that Customer’s continued access and use of the Service poses a threat to Recorded Future or any third party, Recorded Future may, with or without notice to Customer, suspend or terminate Customer’s access and use of the Service or this Agreement. Following any termination of this Agreement, Customer agrees that it shall continue to be bound by this Agreement. For clarity, Customer’s access and use of the Service may require an active subscription as set forth in an Order Form, including payment of relevant fees by or on behalf of the Customer, and in the absence of such an active subscription in good standing, Recorded Future may in its discretion suspend or terminate any or all access or use of the Service.

(B) For paid subscriptions, the Initial Term will commence upon the Effective Date and continue as set forth within the Order Form. Such Initial Term will automatically renew for additional one (1) year Renewal Terms unless either party has given the other party written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of an Initial Term or Renewal Term, or as otherwise terminated in accordance with this Section 2.

(C) Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights granted to Customer hereunder shall terminate and Customer shall cease all use of the Service and Documentation. Further, to the extent that Customer has any copies or back-ups of the Service and/or associated software under its control, it shall delete and destroy all such copies and back-ups.

(D) To the extent that Customer is using any free Service, Customer agrees that Recorded Future, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate this free Service at any time. Customer agrees that any such termination of access to the free Service may be without prior notice, and that Recorded Future will not be liable to Customer or any third party for such termination. Customer may terminate Customer’s use of the free Service at any time by discontinuing use of the free Service.

(E) Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for retaining backup copies of Customer Data at all times; Recorded Future will not provide Customer with an export of Customer Data, upon and/or after termination of the Service.

(B) Customer is prohibited from reselling or otherwise distributing or disclosing Recorded Future Output, delivered directly or as a derived product or service, to any third parties except for limited disclosure to Customer’s Representatives solely in connection with Customer’s internal security purposes.

Each Customer user login/password for the Service is limited to use by a single named individual, cannot be shared with others, and can be used only on a single device or other login point at any time (i.e., no multiple simultaneous logins). All acts and omissions of Customer’s Personnel, and other related parties will be deemed to be those of Customer, and Customer shall be responsible therefor. Further, Customer shall be responsible for any activity conducted through the use of any user credential assigned to it.

(D) The Service is the proprietary intellectual property of Recorded Future that contains trade secrets and is protected by copyright law. Recorded Future retains sole and exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in and to the Service and any other technology used to provide it. Any and all enhancements, modifications, corrections and derivative works that are made to the Service will be owned by Recorded Future. Recorded Future shall own all rights, title and interest in any deliverables created by Recorded Future and provided to Customer, and all such deliverables shall be subject to all Customer restrictions and obligations set forth herein (as if such deliverables were part of the Service hereunder).

(E) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer retains all rights, title and interest in and to Customer Data. The Customer hereby grants to Recorded Future a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable, assignable right and license to use the Customer Data anywhere in the world to provide the Service, develop and improve its offerings, and otherwise in its business as it determines in its discretion. Customer is responsible for Customer Data, including the means by which it is provided, and Customer shall be responsible for ensuring that Customer Data does not violate intellectual property rights, or is not otherwise prohibited.

(F) Recorded Future has the right to refuse access to the Services in the event this Agreement is violated. Nothing contained herein, in any Recorded Future offering, or otherwise made available by Recorded Future should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise any license or right to use any intellectual property, except as explicitly agreed upon by the parties.

**4\. LOGO AND COMMUNICATIONS.** (A) Customer agrees to allow the use of its name and logo in a general list of Recorded Future customers.

(B) Customer consents to receiving communications regarding product updates, customer support, and marketing initiatives from Recorded Future.

You acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding your withdrawal of such consent, Recorded Future shall still be permitted to send you commercial electronic messages specific to our relationship and the Services provided under this Agreement.

CONFIDENTIALITY.** Customer shall maintain as confidential and shall not disclose (except to its Representatives), copy or use for purposes other than its internal security purposes and administration of its Recorded Future’s subscription, Recorded Future’s Confidential Information. Customer agrees to protect all received Confidential Information with the same degree of care that it would use with its own confidential information, but in any event at least industry standard levels of care, and to prevent unauthorized, negligent or inadvertent use, disclosure or publication thereof.

Breach of this Section 5 may cause irreparable harm and damage to Recorded Future. Thus, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, Recorded Future shall have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, without any requirement to post bond, and to recover the amount of damages (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such breach. Customer shall be liable to Recorded Future for any use or disclosure in violation of this Section 5 by Customer, its Representatives, Personnel, or any other party that has received Recorded Future Confidential Information from Customer.

Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Customer provides Recorded Future (or its affiliates or resellers) Feedback, Recorded Future shall be free to use, disclose and otherwise exploit in any manner such Feedback for any purpose, without any obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto. Further, Customer acknowledges and agrees that by providing such Feedback to Recorded Future, Customer hereby grants to Recorded Future an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual, assignable right and license to use such Feedback in whatever way, manner, form or media, now known or hereafter discovered, and for whatever purpose Recorded Future determines in its sole discretion, anywhere in the world.

(C) Approach for Disputes with Certain Customers. (I) This Section 9.8(C) applies to Customer disputes to the extent that either (a) the Customer’s principal place of business, or jurisdiction of incorporation/formation, is outside the United States in a country that is a signatory or ‘Contracting State’ to The New York Arbitration Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (see http://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries), or (b) Recorded Future opts, in its sole discretion, for the dispute to be covered by this Section 9.8(C). (II) Recorded Future (and its affiliates) and Customer hereby consent to resolve any applicable dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement by submission of such dispute to binding and final arbitration in accordance with the Rules, by an arbitral tribunal composed of one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the Rules. Arbitration proceedings may be commenced by either party by providing written notice to the other party. All arbitration proceedings will be held in the location specified in the table in Section 9.8(A) (provided that proceedings may be conducted at another location or by telephone conference call with the consent of the parties and the arbitrator(s)). All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator(s) may render early or summary disposition of some or all issues, after the parties have had a reasonable opportunity to make submissions on these issues. The parties agree that the arbitrator(s) will be empowered to grant injunctive or other equitable relief, but will have no authority to award punitive damages. The above obligation to arbitrate shall extend to any claim by or against any affiliate, agent, officer, employee, director, manager, member or shareholder of a party. (III) Notwithstanding clause II above, (a) either party may initiate litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction seeking any preliminary or temporary remedy in equity, including the issuance of a preliminary or temporary injunction; and (b) judgment on the arbitration award granted in any arbitration hereunder may be entered in, and the parties shall have the right to seek enforcement thereof by, any court of competent jurisdiction (and any additional expenses incurred in enforcing the arbitration award will be charged against the party that resists its enforcement); and (c) the parties hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and waive any objections of improper venue or inconvenient forum, in connection with clauses (III)(a) or (III)(b) above.

If any court or other adjudicatory body determines that the foregoing provision is unenforceable because of its duration or scope, the court or adjudicatory body has the power to reduce the duration or scope of the provision, as the case may be, so that in its reduced form the provision is enforceable. Such power includes the authority to reform the provision by rewriting it, if required, so that it conforms to applicable law and carries out the parties’ intentions under this Agreement. For purposes of the foregoing, the term “solicit” shall not be deemed to mean: (a) circumstances where an employee of Recorded Future (or its affiliates) initiates contact with Customer with regard to possible employment; or (b) general solicitations of employment not specifically targeted at employees of Recorded Future (or its affiliates), including responses to general advertisements.
