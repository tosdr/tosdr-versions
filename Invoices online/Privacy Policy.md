> Integrated Debit Order Solution
> -------------------------------
> 
> We sell adsl bandwidth ranging from a single gig account, up to uncapped accounts. We use invoices online for all our invoicing needs - the invoices online API is integrated in our debit order system that runs on a monthly basis. All clients receive an invoice as soon as their account is debited, and on successful payment the payment is automatically recorded against their account. The system saves us a great deal of time and effort every month, and we recommend that you give it a try.
