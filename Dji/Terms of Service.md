YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SITE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY OR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY, OR THE LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE.

### 15\. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles.

We make no representation that the Site or any Materials included in the Site are appropriate or available for use in your location.

* * *

### 16\. General

You agree that the Site shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over DJI, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and DJI regarding your access to the Site. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 3 through 19, along with the Privacy Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.

* * *

### 17\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

**17.1 Generally**In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DJI in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and DJI agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DJI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.**  
17.2 Exceptions**Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.**  
17.3 Arbitrator**Any arbitration between you and DJI will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, **“AAA Rules”**) of the American Arbitration Association (**“AAA”**), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting DJI.**  
17.4 Notice; Process**A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (**“Notice”**). DJI’s address for Notice is: No. 53 Xianyuan Road, Xili Community, Xili Street, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518055. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (**“Demand”**). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DJI may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DJI must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, DJI will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by DJI in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.**  
17.5 Fees** If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, DJI will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse DJI for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.**  
17.6 No Class Actions** YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and DJI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.**  
17.7 Modifications of This Arbitration Provision**If DJI makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to DJI's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to DJI’s address for Notice, in which case your account with DJI will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.**  
17.8 Enforceability**If Section 17.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 (other than, in the latter case, Section 17.6) will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

Guidelines for Using DJI Trademarks and Copyrights
--------------------------------------------------

These guidelines are for DJI licensees, including authorized resellers, distributors, developers, and other parties wishing to use DJI’s trademarks, service marks, trade dress, or copyrighted materials. You may not use the DJI logo or any other DJI-owned trademarks, service marks, trade dress, or other intellectual property (including copyrighted materials) on or in connection with web sites, products, packaging, manuals, promotional/advertising materials, or for any purpose except pursuant to an express written license from DJI. If you are a DJI licensee and have been provided with special trademark and/or copyright usage guidelines with your license agreement, then you must follow those guidelines; these guidelines also apply to the extent that they do not conflict with such other guidelines. If your license agreement does not provide usage guidelines, then follow these guidelines.

By using a DJI trademark, in whole or in part, you acknowledge that DJI is the sole owner of the trademark and promise that you will not interfere with DJI’s rights in the trademark, including challenging DJI’s use, registration of, or application to register such trademark, alone or in combination with other words, anywhere in the world, and that you will not harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute any DJI trademark. The goodwill derived from using a DJI trademark exclusively inures to the benefit of and belongs to DJI. For further information with respect to DJI’s trademarks and copyrights, please submit your query in writing to DJI’s Intellectual Property Department ([dept-ip@dji.com](mailto:dept-ip@dji.com)).

Usage guidelines:

### 1\. Always use DJI trademarks in an approved form.

DJI’s trademarks\* must be presented in the styles shown below (e.g., unmodified logos, all caps, upper and lower case, or a combination of large and small caps):

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MAVIC™ | AGRAS™ | DJI™ |
| ZENMUSE™ | INSPIRE™ | PHANTOM™ |
| THE FUTURE OF POSSIBLE™ | GUIDANCE™ | WOOKONG™ |
| LIGHTBRIDGE™ | MANIFOLD™ | MATRICE™ |
| SMOOTHTRACK™ | OSMO™ | NAZA™ |
| ROBOMASTERS™ | RONIN™ | SKYPIXEL™ |
| SPREADING WINGS® |

\*The trademarks listed herein are for illustration purpose, and they do not represent an exhaustive list of DJI’s trademarks. You are obliged to follow these guidelines for all DJI trademarks. DJI will make reasonable efforts to provide notice of its existing trademarks. However, absence of any DJI trademark from this list does not constitute a waiver of DJI’s usage requirement described in these guidelines concerning that trademark.

Changes, alterations, phonetic equivalents, foreign language equivalents, takeoffs, or abbreviations in the names or logos above are not allowed without DJI’s prior written consent. Any variation must be cleared through or approved by DJI.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| RIGHT | RIGHT |
| OSMO™ | SKYPIXEL™ |
| WRONG | WRONG |
| Osmo | SkyPixel® |

### 2\. always use DJI trademarks in a manner clearly indicating that they are trademarks OWNED BY DJI.

All DJI trademarks must be properly marked to give notice that they are, in fact, trademarks of DJI. In the United States, the federal registration symbol “®” must be used as designated above for registered trademarks, while all other marks must be used with the symbol “™” where the mark initially appears. Use of the registration symbol or “™” must appear with the first usage of the trademark in a document; subsequent occurrences do not require the symbols. When used in a printed document, the symbols should be half the point size of the word and then superscripted. The list of registered and unregistered marks will be updated periodically as pending applications mature to registration, and as such, it is important to determine status of the marks before using either symbol.

A footnote reference to ownership of the trademarks must be used on all products, documentation and advertisements in the following format:

“_{insert trademark(s) used}_  is/are trademark(s) of DJI.”

DJI’s trademarks must not be joined with other terms (by a hyphen, for instance) nor used with unapproved logos, graphics, photos, slogans, numbers, design features or symbols. DJI’s trademarks should never be “made plural,” never be mixed with other trademarks, and a trademark's spelling should never be altered.

### 3\. Always use DJI trademarks as adjectives, never as nouns or verbs, and the marks must be followed by the appropriate generic terminology.

DJI’s trademarks are meant to signify the brand or source of the product and may not be used in a manner which suggests that the trademark is the generic name of the product. The most common mistake is to use the trademark as a noun instead of as an adjective followed by the generic term.

|     |
| --- |
| RIGHT |
| “The PHANTOM™ drone carries a high resolution camera.” |
| WRONG |
| “The PHANTOM™ carries a high resolution camera.” |

### 4\. DO NOT IMPLY OR SUGGEST THAT A PRODUCT BASED ON DJI’S TECHNOLOGY IS A DJI PRODUCT OR THAT DJI SPONSORS OR ENDORSES THE PRODUCT.

While DJI understands and appreciates the licensee’s need to accurately describe the technology incorporated into the product as DJI technology, the product materials and advertising must not wrongly imply that the licensee’s product is a DJI product or that it is sponsored or endorsed by DJI, explicitly or implicitly. Care must be taken to clearly distinguish DJI’s products (and trademarks) from the licensee’s products and marks, as discussed more specifically in these guidelines. Some basic examples are:

|     |
| --- |
| RIGHT |
| “The ACME™ propeller guards are for use with PHANTOM™ drones.” |
| WRONG |
| “The PHANTOM™ propeller guards are made by ACME™.” |
| RIGHT |
| “The ACME™ drone system incorporates DJI’s PHANTOM™ drone.” |
| WRONG |
| “The ACME™ PHANTOM™ drone system incorporates the DJI drone.” |

### 5\. never use a DJI Trademark as part of your name, YOUR PRODUCT’S or service’s NAME, or YOUR trademark.

With certain limited exceptions, DJI trademarks may not be used or registered as part of another company’s mark, company name, product name, or service name; provided that DJI’s marks can be used in explanatory fashion (such as “for use with PHANTOM™ drones”). This restriction includes the names of applications created by developers using our SDK.

Also, licensees may not personify trademarks or create characters that represent the trademarks. However, the trademarks may be used in taglines in accordance with the guidelines listed above.

### 6\. never use a DJI Trademark in a domain name

You may not use or register any domain name that is identical, virtually identical, similar or confusingly similar to any DJI trademark.

#### unacceptable

dji-inspired.co.uk

phantom.club

thefutureofpossible.cl

dajiang.cn

### 7\. DEVELOPERS MAY USE DJI TRADEMARKS TO INDICATE COMPATIBILITY

Developers may use any DJI word mark (including product and technology names but not including any DJI logos), or any images of DJI products in which such developers own or have a license to the trademarks and/or copyrights, to refer on packaging or promotional/advertising materials to the fact that the developers’ products are compatible with the referenced DJI product or technology, provided that a) the use complies with these guidelines, b) the product is in fact compatible with or otherwise works with the referenced DJI product or technology, c) the DJI word mark is used in a manner that is less prominent than the product name, and d) the use does not cast DJI or its products or technologies in a false or derogatory light. Unless you have a separate, written license from DJI to do so, you cannot use any trademark and/or copyrighted material owned or licensed by DJI, including without limitation any of DJI’s photographs, music, graphical user interface designs, etc., without DJI’s prior written consent.

### 8\. OTHER FAIR USES OF THE DJI TRADEMARKS

Anyone may make fair use of the DJI word marks to make true, factual statements about DJI or to discuss DJI products or technologies. If you do so, we request that you help us protect our intellectual property by complying with the foregoing guidelines and that you include a disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement by DJI, similar to the following, on any publication or printed materials:

“This work has not been authorized, sponsored, or otherwise approved by DJI.”

These Terms and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and DJI regarding your use of the Product. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 1 and 3-10 of the Product Terms will survive, as will any other provisions specified as surviving the termination of the Software Terms of Use, the DJI Privacy Policy, and any other applicable terms and conditions in such agreements.

EXCEPTION, for EU USERS: We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms without your prior express consent, provided that we assign these Terms on the same conditions or conditions that are no less advantageous to you.

### 10\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION.

FOR EU USERS: Section 10 is not applicable to you.

**10.1. GENERALLY.**

IN THE INTEREST OF RESOLVING DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND DJI IN THE MOST EXPEDIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EVERY DISPUTE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY **BINDING ARBITRATION.** ARBITRATION IS LESS FORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A **NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY,** MAY ALLOW FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND CAN BE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.2, THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES INCLUDES ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ASPECT OF THESE TERMS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A CLAIM ARISES DURING OR AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS. **YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DJI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.**

**10.2. EXCEPTIONS.**

Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

FOR AUSTRALIAN USERS: Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) claim in relation to your rights and statutory guarantees in Section 6.1; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

**10.3. ARBITRATOR.**

Any arbitration between you and DJI will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting DJI.

**10.4. NOTICE; PROCESS.**

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). DJI’s address for Notice is: Lobby of T2, DJI Sky City, No. 53 Xianyuan Road, Xili Community, Xili Street, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518055. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DJI may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DJI must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, DJI will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by DJI in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.

**10.5. FEES.**

If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, DJI will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse DJI for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

**10.6. NO CLASS ACTIONS.**

YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and DJI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

**10.7. MODIFICATIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.**

If DJI makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to DJI's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to DJI’s address for Notice, in which case your account with DJI will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

**10.8. ENFORCEABILITY.**

If Section 10.6 is found to be unenforceable, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 8 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE DJI ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY DJI ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

### 12\. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.

  
Subject to the country specific provisions below, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and DJI agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating any dispute.  
  
**

### For EU users the following sections apply:

**  
You and DJI both agree that these Terms are non-exclusively governed by the laws of England and Wales, which means that the laws of England and Wales apply but that you still enjoy the protection of the consumer protection laws of the country in which you live.  
  
You agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Terms in a court located in England or in the EU country in which you live. However, if you are a consumer, DJI will bring claims against you before the courts of the EU country in which you live.  
  
**

### For Australian users the following sections apply:

**  
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and DJI agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Victoria, Australia for the purpose of litigating any dispute. For avoidance of doubt, Section 13 will not apply to matters that may be taken to the small claims court or matters relating to your rights and statutory guarantees described in Section 10.1.  
  
  
  

### [13\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION](#01)

  
FOR EU USERS: Section 13 is not applicable to you.  
  
13.1. Generally. IN THE INTEREST OF RESOLVING DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND DJI IN THE MOST EXPEDIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER, YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EVERY DISPUTE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION IS LESS FORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, MAY ALLOW FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND CAN BE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.2, THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES INCLUDES ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ASPECT OF THESE TERMS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A CLAIM ARISES DURING OR AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.  
  
13.2. Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 13.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.  
  
FOR AUSTRALIAN USERS: Despite the provisions of Section 13.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) claim in relation to your rights and statutory guarantees in Section 10.1; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.  
  
13.3. Any arbitration between you and DJI will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting DJI.  
  
13.4. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). DJI’s address for Notice is: Lobby of T2, DJI Sky City, No. 53 Xianyuan Road, Xili Community, Xili Street, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518055. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DJI may commence an arbitration proceeding.  
  
13.5. Fees. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the AAA Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, DJI will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.  
  
13.6. No Class Actions. YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and DJI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DJI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.  
  
13.7. Modifications of This Arbitration Provision. If DJI makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to DJI’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to DJI’s address for Notice, in which case your account with DJI will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.  
  
13.8. Enforceability. If this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.  
  
  
  

### 14\. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

  
We may modify these Terms from time to time in which case we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. If we make changes that are material, we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you, such as by e-mail and/or by placing a prominent notice on the Site or the DJI Software. However, it is your sole responsibility to review these Terms from time to time to view any such changes. The updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the modifications have become effective will be deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms.  
  
  
  

### 15\. EXPORT LAWS

  
You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.  
  
  
  

### 16\. GENERAL

  
These Terms and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and DJI regarding your use of the Services. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms. Termination will not limit any of our other rights or remedies at law or in equity.  
  
EXCEPTION, for EU USERS: We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms without your prior express consent, provided that we assign these Terms on the same conditions or conditions that are no less advantageous to you.
