----------------------

We may collect information about you directly from you, from third parties, and automatically through your use of the DJI Products and Services. Some information we collect from you are referred to as “personal information” or “personal data” in this Policy. Personal information or personal data is data that can identify you, or data that we can relate to you, such as your name, email address, credit card number, and shipping address.  
  
If you do not provide your information when requested, you may not be able to use DJI Products and Services if that information is necessary to provide you with DJI Products and Services or if we are legally required to collect it.  
  

* Account Information. When you create a DJI account, you may provide us with information that includes your user ID, email address (or phone number, based on the country located), password or other information for account verification. You might choose to provide us with additional information — like gender, birthday, professional information and other information on your profile page.
    
* Contact Information. When you place an order with DJI, sign up for notifications or updates, or contact us for customer service, you may provide us with your contact information including your name, alias, email address, shipping address, billing address and phone number(s). Certain jurisdictions require provision of contact information when activating unmanned aerial system (UAS) products, opening online accounts, or under other similar circumstances as required by law. DJI only collects and stores UAS-regulatory related information to the extent required by applicable law.
    
* Payment Information. When you place an order with DJI or engage in financial transactions by using DJI Products and Services, you may provide us with your payment information such as your bank account, credit card number, or debit card number.

When you choose to upload your photos, videos or other content using DJI Products and Services, including text content relating thereto, we may collect and store such content, including EXIF data relating to the photo or video. If such content contains information about others, you should obtain any required or appropriate consent from such persons and inform them about this Policy prior to uploading such content to DJI.
    
* Communications. When you contact us, we may collect information about your communications with us, including your contact information, and the time, topic, and content of your communications.

In order to provide your location, you may be required to enable certain features of your device (such as GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth) to identify your location through a variety of means, including GPS location, IP address, cell tower location, or detection by physical on-location Wi-Fi or Bluetooth sensors. If your location is collected through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth sensors of your mobile device or other non-DJI Products, please be aware that such sensors, and the associated data services, may be provided by a third party, which may access such information for the purpose of providing such data services to DJI. You may provide your geolocation information to third-party map service providers to receive location-based services on DJI Products. When you unlock the geofencing features embedded in DJI Products and Services, you may provide us with the area code of your unlocked areas (“Authorization Zones”).
    
* Device-Related and Flight-Related Information. When you activate DJI products, request for after-sales service, unlock the geofencing features or upgrade the firmware, you may provide us with information about your DJI device, including model and serial number. Our after-sales team may ask for your flight data to provide the service you requested.

Such information includes your IP address or device address, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use a Product or Service, hardware version, and operating system. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with DJI email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.
    
* Employment-related Information. When you apply for a position at DJI, you may provide us with your educational information, such as your academic degree and graduated school, and employment-related information, such as your former employers and working achievements. We may also collect such information from third party recruiters or websites.

It applies to the Personal Information of certain California residents, who are Consumers receiving products or services for which we are a Business, as those terms are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (California Civil Code §§ 1798.100 to 1798.199) and its implementing regulations, as amended or superseded from time to time (the “CCPA”), .  
  
Any capitalized terms herein are intended to have the same meaning as in the CCPA.

### California Consumers’ Rights and Choices

If you are a Consumer, California law may permit you to request information regarding the:

* Categories of Personal Information (as defined by applicable California law) collected, Sold, Shared or disclosed by us;
    
* Purposes for which categories of Personal Information collected by us are used;
    
* Sources of information from which we collect Personal Information;
    
* The categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Information; and
    
* Specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.
    

In addition, if you are a Consumer you may

* Opt-out of Sale or Sharing of your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. We do not sell or share your Personal Information as those terms are defined under California law;
    
* Opt-in to certain financial incentive programs we may offer related to the collection, Sale, Sharing or deletion of your Personal Information;
    
* Request deletion of your Personal Information by us and our Service Providers, in some circumstances;
    
* Correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you; and
    
* Limit the use of sensitive Personal Information. Under the California laws, you can limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive Personal Information to certain purposes specified by law. We only use or disclose sensitive Personal Information for such permitted purposes, so we do not provide an opt out.
    

Further, California law provides Consumers with the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by a Business for the exercise of these rights regarding Personal Information.

### Requests

You can make requests related to your California privacy rights at the attached [link](https://www.dji.com/nz/policy/ccpa-contact-form). You may also make those requests by email to [support@privacy.dji.com](mailto:support@privacy.dji.com) or in writing to SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd., 14th Floor, West Wing, Skyworth Semiconductor Design Building, No.18 Gaoxin South 4th Ave, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518057. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax or social media).  
  
We will review the information provided and may request additional information to ensure we are interacting with the correct individual. If you have an online account with us, you may be required to log-in to your account for identity verification. If you do not have an account with us, additional information to verify your identity may be required by law before we may take action upon such a request. This additional information may vary depending on the nature of your request and/or the nature of the information about which your request relates. In some cases, we may also be required by law to obtain a signed declaration under penalty of perjury from you that you are the subject of the request being made. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from your account, we will delay taking action on your request until we can appropriately verify your identity and the request as authentic.  
  
By law, we are not required to collect Personal Information that we otherwise would not collect in the ordinary course of our business, retain Personal Information for longer than we would otherwise retain such information in the ordinary course of our business, or re-identify or otherwise link information that is not maintained in a manner that would be considered Personal Information. If we have not requested specific additional information from you to verify your request, please do not send such information.  
  
We generally will aim to avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot reasonably verify your identity or more information is needed for security or fraud-prevention purposes, we may consider any of the following factors, alone or in combination, in requesting additional information:

* The type, sensitivity, and value of the Personal Information collected and maintained about the Consumer, as applicable law requires a more stringent verification process for sensitive or valuable Personal Information;
    
* The risk of harm to the Consumer posed by any unauthorized access or deletion;
    
* The likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek the Personal Information;
    
* Whether the Personal Information to be provided by the Consumer to verify their identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent requests or being spoofed or fabricated;
    
* The manner in which the Business interacts with the Consumer;
    
* Available technology for verification; and
    
* Other factors that may be reasonable in the circumstances, are consistent with industry practice, are recommended by California government officials, or which may be required by law or regulation following the effective date of this Privacy Policy.
    

If your request is regarding household information, the same verification steps above are required before we can provide you with aggregate household information. For us to process a request for access to or deletion of specific pieces of information regarding your household, all members of the household must make the request, and we must be able to verify each household member.  
  
In some cases, we may not have sufficient information about you or your household to be able to verify your identity or sufficiently differentiate you from another Consumer or household to the degree of certainty required by law, in which case, we will not be able to act upon your request. In such cases, it may be unlikely that we would be able to identify you or your household in the future without collecting significantly more information or seeking to re-identify de-identified information. At this time, we do not intend to take such steps in response to a request made pursuant to this Privacy Policy and applicable law does not require that we do so. If, in the future, we determine a reasonable method to identify you or your household absent such steps, we will provide an update to you through this Privacy Policy and in response to any such request at that time.  
  
Information that you submit for the purpose of allowing us to verify your identity in furtherance of a Consumer-related or household-related request pursuant to California law will only be used by us, and our Service Providers if any, for that purpose and no other. Except where we are required by law to maintain such information for record-keeping purposes, we will take steps to delete any new Personal Information collected for the purpose of verification as soon as practical after processing your request.  
  
Please also be aware that making any such request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of Personal Information or content you may have posted, and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow us to fulfill your request, including, for example, where fulfilling your request may infringe upon the rights and freedoms of other Consumers.  
  
We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee or take other appropriate action in response to requests from a Consumer or household that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.  
  
You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf pursuant to applicable law. We accept documentation of your designation in the form of a valid power of attorney and/or a notarized statement. You must submit evidence of your designation of an authorized agent in writing to: SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.14th Floor, West Wing, Skyworth Semiconductor Design Building, No.18 Gaoxin South 4th Ave, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518057. We may require verification of your authorized agent in addition to the information for verification above for Consumers and households.

### Do Not Track

DJI does not currently take steps to respond to browsers’ “Do Not Track” signals as no uniform standard to respond to such signals has been developed at this time.

### Deidentified Information

Where we maintain or use deidentified information, we will continue to maintain and use the deidentified information only in a deidentified fashion and will not attempt to re-identify the information.

### Notice of Financial Incentive

With regard to our education discount program, we offer financial incentives to Consumers based upon the retention of sale of a Consumer’s Personal Information calculated based on a good-faith estimate of the value of the Consumer’s data, which forms the basis for offering such financial incentives. The financial incentive offered is a discount on the price of some DJI Products and Services, based on affiliation with an employer group or educational institution with which we partner. The categories of Personal Information that are implicated by the financial incentive or price or service difference include your place of employment or educational institution. You may choose to provide an email address associated with your employer or educational institution, which we will validate manually.  
  
The method we use to calculate the value of a Consumer’s data is that our calculation used in good-faith of the likelihood of increased sales of DJI Products and Services to Consumers at your place of employment or educational institution.  
  
You may enroll in or withdraw from our financial incentive program at any time by updating your preferences by email at [support@privacy.dji.com](mailto:support@privacy.dji.com), or in writing at SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.14th Floor, West Wing, Skyworth Semiconductor Design Building, No.18 Gaoxin South 4th Ave, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518057.
