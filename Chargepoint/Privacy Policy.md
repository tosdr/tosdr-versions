We may also disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to protect or defend ChargePoint or other parties, including to defend or enforce this Policy, our Terms of Use or any other contractual arrangement or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of ChargePoint, our agents and affiliates, our employees, users or the public.

    With respect to our disclosure of information to service providers and third-party network providers, such parties may have limited access to certain features and data from the ChargePoint network to be able to provide the required services (such as billing and pricing). If you are a beneficiary of a charging arrangement with a provider, for example, when your employer or a leasing company has agreed to cover the cost of your charging session, the provider will have access to your session and, in some cases, to certain data within your account.
    
    With regard to the processing of such data, ChargePoint and the provider are either individual (sole) controllers or joint controllers, depending on the contractual agreement. Please refer to the provider’s privacy policy to understand how they process, collect, use and disclose your data. If you would like a summary of the commitments between the parties where ChargePoint is a joint controller, please use the contact information provided in Section 11.
    
5. **Security measures**  
      
    
    ChargePoint has implemented administrative, physical and technical security measures to protect your information under our control.
    
    While ChargePoint takes precautions against possible security breaches of its website and Service, no website or internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur. We are unable to guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our website or stored in our systems, and any transmission is at your own risk.
    
    You should take steps to keep your information safe (including your password) and log out of your account after use. Where we have provided or you have chosen a password that enables you to access certain parts of our website or an RFID card that provides access to charging stations, you are responsible for keeping your password and RFID card confidential. You must not share these with anyone or store them in a way that may allow a third party to access them. If that happens, you should report it immediately to the contact provided in Section 11. ChargePoint cannot be held and is not responsible for your failure to keep your password or RFID card secure.
    
    You should update your password periodically to help reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your account with us. When you do, you should strengthen your password with the combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation and other symbols.
    
6. **Retention, deletion and storage**  
      
    
    We generally retain information for as long as it may be relevant to the purposes above and in compliance with applicable law. To dispose of any personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional period of time.
    
7. **Links to third-party websites and services**  
      
    
    This website may contain links to third-party sites. Access to any other websites linked from our website is at the user’s own risk, and ChargePoint is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, data, opinions, advice or statements made on those websites. ChargePoint provides these links merely as a convenience, and the inclusion of such links does not imply any kind of endorsement. If you provide any third party with your information, we recommend that you review their privacy policies as ChargePoint does not control how they collect, process and transfer your information.

    * **Account information.** You may modify some of your account information by accessing your account or contacting Customer Service (please see Section 11, Contact us).

Please note that we may still send you certain communications relating to your use of our Service (e.g., service announcements, notices about new features or information on the Service, administrative messages, and communications about your account).
9. **Children’s privacy**  
      
    
    The website and Service are intended for persons licensed to drive. In the United States, this typically means individuals over age 16 and, in Europe, age 17. ChargePoint does not knowingly collect any information from anyone under 16. If you are under 16 or 17, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible as required by applicable law.
    
10. **Changes to our privacy policy**  
      
    
    We may change this Policy to reflect changes in the law, our information practices or the features of the Service. At the top of our Policy, we will indicate the date of the most recent update.

    2. Residents of the European Economic Area, Switzerland and United Kingdom (“Europe”)
        1. Our legal basis for processing your personal data
            
            When you visit our website from Europe, indicate you are a European resident, when using our services in Europe or when you visit our European offices, the controller of any personal information processed is ChargePoint Network (Netherlands) B.V. (see contact in Section 11).
            
            ChargePoint uses the following legal basis for processing your personal information:
            
            * **Contractual commitments (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).** We may use, share or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, we may process personal data to perform our agreement with you under the ChargePoint Driver Terms of Service, and if applicable, under an agreement between ChargePoint and a provider that governs the terms of the ChargePoint network services.
            * **Your consent (Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR).** Where required by law, and in some other cases as described above, we use, share or disclose information with your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by emailing privacy.eu@chargepoint.com.
            * **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).** In some cases, we use, share or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Services, preventing fraud and managing legal issues.
            * **Legal compliance (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR).** We need to use, share and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations. This includes processing personal data subject to tax, financial or other governmental regulations.
            
            We will not process any of your personal data without having a legal basis for doing so.
            
            You have no statutory or contractual obligation to provide us with any personal data. However, depending on the activity, some of the information we may ask you to provide is identified as mandatory (because we need it in order to provide the requested Service). If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular Service, you will not be able to use that Service.
            
        2. Transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union or without an adequate level of data protection as determined by the European Commission
            
            ChargePoint is a global company that operates its website and Service through servers located in several countries. If you select a country in Europe as your country of residence, your personal data is mainly hosted on servers within the European Union.
            
            We may have to grant access to your personal data, such as account registration and charging network data, to ChargePoint affiliates in the United States and India (e.g., to provide you with support when receiving Services or to allow analysis of the data to develop and improve our products and services). Those purposes include usage patterns of the ChargePoint charging station network that help inform product development, safety features, sales strategy, support and maintenance.
            
            Further, these ChargePoint entities may need to access information for billing and accounting purposes. Transfers to these ChargePoint entities are based on the appropriate standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. You may request further information about our transfer safeguards by sending an email to privacy.eu@chargepoint.com.
            
        3. Rights of European residents

You also have the right to request the personal data to be transmitted directly from us to another controller, where technically feasible.
            * **Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.** Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the country of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes European privacy laws. For the Netherlands, the supervisory authority is the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens. For the United Kingdom, the regulator is the Information Commissioner’s Office. In addition to the rights mentioned above, you also have the right to object to certain processing and the right to withdraw your consent, where processing is based on such.
            * **Right to object.** You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data, based on legitimate interests or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In such case, we shall no longer process the personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override your interests, rights and freedoms or where the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you shall have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data for such purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If you would like to object to any processing of your personal data, please send us a message in writing to ChargePoint at the address detailed above or email us at privacy.eu@chargepoint.com.
            * **Right to withdraw consent.** Where the processing is based on your informed consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

    3. Supplemental privacy notice for California residents
        
        The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information that we have collected about California consumers, the categories of sources from which the information was collected, the business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined by applicable law) for which the information was collected, and the categories of parties to whom we disclose personal information.
        
        Throughout this Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect, the sources of that information and when we disclose it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the “categories” of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for “business or commercial purposes” (as those terms are defined by applicable law). The categories of personal information are identifiers (such as name, address and email address), commercial information (such as transaction data), financial data (such as credit card and other financial account information), internet or other network or device activity (such as IP address), professional or employment-related information (such as your current employer), geolocation information, inference data about you, physical characteristics or description (such as when you voluntarily submit a photo), audio and visual information (such as when you call into customer service or visit our offices) and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. The categories of sensitive personal information are account log-in and password or other credentials allowing access to your account and precise geolocation.
        
        ChargePoint and our service providers collect and disclose the above categories of personal information for the purposes described in our Policy. This includes the following business and commercial purposes (as those terms are defined in applicable law):
        
        * Provision of the Service (e.g., account servicing and maintenance, order processing and fulfillment, customer service, advertising and marketing, analytics, and communication about the Service)
        * Operations (e.g., to enable and troubleshoot our Service)
        * Audit of consumer interactions on our site (e.g., measuring ad impressions)
        * Security and integrity to the extent the use of the personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for these purposes
        * Bug detection, error reporting and activities to maintain the quality or safety of our Service
        * Short-term, transient use, such as customizing content that we or our service providers display on the Service
        * Improvement of our existing Service and development of new services (e.g., by conducting research to develop new products or features or analyzing and measuring our customer support interactions)
        * Activities that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third-party advertising and communications with you about relevant offers from third-party partners
        * Other purposes about which we will notify you
        
        We collect the categories of personal information identified above directly from you, through your use of the Service, from our affiliates and from third parties such as site hosts, other users and social networks.
        
        We describe our information-sharing practices in the Policy above. In the previous 12 months, we may have disclosed certain categories of personal information with unaffiliated parties (as defined by the CCPA) for the business purposes described above. For example, we may disclose your information with providers when you connect with a ChargePoint station operated by that provider, or site host. You may also intentionally direct us to disclose your information with utility companies or their vendors. The information we disclose with providers and utility companies may include account registration data (identifiers) and charging network data (commercial information).
        
        ### Rights of California consumers
        
        If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:
        
        * Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing your personal information; the categories of third parties to whom we disclose, sell or share personal information; and the categories of personal information we sell or share
        * Provide access to or a copy of certain information we hold about you
        * Delete certain information we have about you
        * Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you
        
        You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Service to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service.
        
        If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through one of our available channels:
        
        * Email: [privacy@chargepoint.com](mailto:privacy@chargepoint.com)
        * [Web form](https://na.chargepoint.com/guest/chargepoint_help), or
        * Phone (24/7): +1-888-758-4389
        
        You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide the information identified in the webform or as otherwise directed by us. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
        
        The CCPA requires businesses that sell personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such sales. Some people have taken the position that when a website uses third-party cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website or app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa) and, in most cases, merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. These analytics and advertising services technologies may access identifiers (such as IP addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (such as information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on a ChargePoint website) and commercial information (such as the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering an electric vehicle) to those sorts of companies. While ChargePoint does not believe these are “sales” as that term is defined under the CCPA, you can opt out of this activity by changing your “privacy choices” on our website (when accessing the [ChargePoint website](https://www.chargepoint.com/), you will be presented with a privacy preference center which will enable your choices).
        
        The CCPA also requires businesses that share personal information to provide an opt-out from such sharing. Under the CCPA, sharing is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We share information for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. As part of this advertising, we may share identifiers (such as IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (such as information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on a ChargePoint website), and commercial information (such as the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering an electric vehicle) with advertising platforms and advertising networks. To opt out of such sharing, please change your “privacy choices” online, on our website (when accessing the [ChargePoint website](https://www.chargepoint.com/), you will be presented with a privacy preference center which will enable your choices).
        
        Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through the Global Privacy Control**.** Any opt-out preferences you have indicated through these methods will only apply to the specific device or browser on which you made them. For more information on how to use the Global Privacy Control, please visit www.globalprivacycontrol.org.
        
        We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of children under 16.
        
        The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
        
        The retention schedule of your personal information is further detailed above, in Section 6, Retention, deletion and storage.
        
        **California Do Not Track setting.** We do not respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the Global Privacy Control browser choice referenced above.
        
    4. Supplemental privacy notice for residents of other states
        
        Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights. Where applicable, the state law may permit you to request that we:
        
        * Confirm whether or not we are processing your personal information and provide you with access to such personal information
        * Correct inaccuracies in your personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information
        * Delete your personal information
        * Provide you a copy of personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another business, where our processing is carried out by automated means
        * Opt you out of the processing of the personal information for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal information or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you
        
        Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so we can provide the Service to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service.
        
        If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at [privacy@chargepoint.com](mailto:privacy@chargepoint.com) or visit our [Web form](https://na.chargepoint.com/guest/chargepoint_help). You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide the information identified in the webform or as otherwise directed by us.
        
        ChargePoint may use your personal information to send you targeted advertising (as that term is defined in certain state privacy laws). To opt out of targeted advertising, please change your privacy choices online (when accessing the [ChargePoint website](https://www.chargepoint.com/), you will be presented with a privacy preference center which will enable your preferences).
        
        Depending on where you live, if we deny your request to exercise any of the rights above, you may have the right to appeal that denial by contacting us at [privacy@chargepoint.com](mailto:privacy@chargepoint.com) with the subject “Data privacy request appeal” and providing us with information about why you are appealing the decision.
        
    5. Residents of Canada
        
        If you are a Canadian resident, you may have the right to access your personal information. To exercise that right, please submit a request at [privacy@chargepoint.com](mailto:privacy@chargepoint.com) or visit our [Web form](https://na.chargepoint.com/guest/chargepoint_help). You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide the information identified in the webform or as otherwise directed by us. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
        
        ChargePoint is a global company that operates its website and Service through servers located in several countries.
