    The NCUA protects the safety and soundness of the credit union system by identifying, monitoring and reducing risks to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, the Share Insurance Fund provides up to $250,000 of federal share insurance to millions of account holders in all federal credit unions and the overwhelming majority of state-chartered credit unions.

    Cyberattacks and cybersecurity vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the financial system. Because of vulnerabilities within the credit union industry and the broader financial system to potential cyberattacks, cybersecurity is one of the NCUA’s top supervisory priorities and a top-tier risk under the agency’s enterprise risk-management program.
