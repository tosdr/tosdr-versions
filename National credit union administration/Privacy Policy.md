### Personal Information Voluntarily Given to the NCUA

Submitting personal information (name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) is voluntary and is not required to access information on our website. However, you may choose to provide the NCUA with personal information -- for example by completing a form, or sending us an email. Before you do, there are a few things that we would like you to know:

We will use the information that you provide to respond to your message and/or help us get you the information or services you request, but doing so may involve multiple people (including other agencies) seeing the information that you provide.

We will maintain the information in accordance with the Privacy Act (as applicable) and will destroy the information in accordance with the Federal Records Act and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration.

Also, in some cases, the information may be subject to disclosure to a third party (for example, if required by a Freedom of Information Act request, court order, or Congressional access request, or if authorized by a Privacy Act System of Records Notice).
