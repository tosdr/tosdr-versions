        5. ZA/UM DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION OF THE WEBSITE OR GAME WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR THAT ERRORS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE WEBSITE OR GAME ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

6. AGE RESTRICTIONS
    1. ZA/UM does not target the Website or the Game to users under 13 years of age. To use the Game or Website you must be both: (a) of an age which meets the minimum age certification requirement of the Game in the territory you are in (where applicable); and (b) in any event, you must be over the age of 13 years. By using the Game or Website you therefore confirm that you are over 13 years of age and, where you are under 18, you confirm that you have your parent’s or guardian’s consent and that your parent or guardian has read and agreed to these terms.
7. USER RULES
    1. You further agree that you will not in any way conduct yourself in a manner which is illegal or which gives rise to civil or criminal liability or which might call into disrepute ZA/UM or the Game.
    2. Where the Game allows you to share pre-determined messages with other users, ZA/UM shall be entitled to remove, restrict, suspend or alter that ability for any reason in its sole and absolute discretion.
    3. You will cooperate fully with ZA/UM to investigate any suspected illegal, fraudulent or improper activity.
    4. If you feel that the behaviour of another user breaches this EULA then please let ZA/UM know by sending an email to [zaum@zaumstudio.com](mailto:zaum@zaumstudio.com) with details of the potential breach and/or the user responsible. ZA/UM will take reasonable steps to deal with any breach.
8. VIRTUAL ITEMS
    1. As part of and to enhance your use and enjoyment of the Game you may be able to obtain additional features and digital content that form part of the experience of the Game (“Virtual Items”).
    2. Virtual Items are gameplay features of the Game, they have no cash or real world value, they are not redeemable or exchangeable for anything with a real world value and they can be used as part of the Game only, in accordance with this EULA.
    3. Purchases of Virtual Items are subject to this EULA and the terms of any third party app store through which your purchase is made. Purchases are made via permitted third party stores, such as Steam, Apple or Google, and not via ZA/UM. To the extent that this EULA conflicts with such agreement between you and the relevant third party in respect of any purchase of Virtual Items, the terms of your agreement with the third party app store shall prevail.
    4. To cancel a purchase of any Virtual Items you should contact the platform through which you made that purchase. If you cannot use Virtual Items due to an error or fault, you may still be charged. If this happens, please contact ZA/UM and we will endeavour to rectify the issue and if we are unable to do so you may be entitled to a refund via the platform through which you made that purchase.
    5. Virtual Items that may be purchased (e.g. through permitted stores such as Steam, Google or Apple) may be advertised in the Game.
    6. Without limiting Game and Virtual Item purchases from ZA/UM’s permitted stores, it is a condition and fundamental term of this EULA and your use of the Game that you must not buy, sell, barter, swap, exchange, trade, lend, rent or otherwise deal in any way with any Virtual Item outside of the Game (such as on unauthorised item trading sites) or in any way other than as expressly provided above. Virtual Items may only be exchanged for certain other designated Virtual Items in and as part of the Game only and where that functionality is made available by ZA/UM.
    7. Subject to Clause 4, ZA/UM may manage, vary, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items in its sole discretion, with or without notice (including not supplying Virtual Items if it is reasonable to do so). Subject to clause 4, ZA/UM shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that ZA/UM exercises such rights. Your statutory rights which cannot be limited or excluded are unaffected by this clause 8.7.
    8. When you submit, or anyone using your device submits, a request to purchase Virtual Items you are offering to purchase them for the price stated and our acceptance of that offer shall only occur once we make the Virtual Items available to you, prior to which your order may be declined for any reason.
    9. Please notify ZA/UM immediately if you dispute a transaction involving Virtual Items or believe that any transaction is unauthorised.
    10. Your statutory rights which cannot be limited or excluded are unaffected by this Clause 8.
9. Consumer Rights AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
    1. This EULA shall not limit any rights you might have as a consumer that may not be excluded or limited under applicable law.
    2. Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint you may choose to make, you may want to consider an alternative dispute resolution provider. The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution which can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. For the purposes of Regulation (EU) 524/2013, we are not required to use and we do not use an alternative dispute Resolution service.
10. Apple DEVELOPER TERMS AND THIRD PARTY STORES
    1. You acknowledge that you have agreed to the relevant store’s terms of use and service (e.g. the terms of Steam, Apple or Google) relating to your transaction with such store.
    2. The following terms of this clause are the terms which ZA/UM is required by Apple to notify you of and obtain your agreement in respect of using the iOS and Apple versions of the Game (for example, on devices: Apple iPad, iPhone).
    3. You and ZA/UM acknowledge that this EULA is concluded between you and ZA/UM only, and not with Apple Inc., nor any subsidiary or affiliate company of Apple Inc., (“Apple”). You also acknowledge that ZA/UM is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof.
    4.

    5. ZA/UM is solely responsible for providing support and maintenance for the Game. You and ZA/UM acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Game.

    7. You acknowledge that in the event of a third party claim that the Game or your possession and use of the Game infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, then ZA/UM shall be solely responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property right infringement claim, and not Apple.
    8. You confirm that:
        1. you are not located in a country that is subject to a US Government embargo, or that has been designated by the US Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and
        2. you are not listed on any US Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

11. ADVERTS
    1. We are responsible for the placing of advertisements in our Services (to the extent we undertake this activity, and as may vary between our Services), but we do not control or review the specific content of those advertisements. We do, however, have control over the general types of advertisements that are placed at a high-level to take all reasonable efforts so that the services do not contain any inappropriate advertisements.
    2. Please report any advert that you find offensive or inappropriate to [zaum@zaumstudio.com](mailto:zaum@zaumstudio.com).

12. Indemnity and Remedies
    1. You hereby indemnify (agree to compensate), defend and hold harmless ZA/UM and ZA/UM’s affiliates, officers, directors, owners, licensors, service providers, partners, contractors, employees, agents and licensees (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all any liabilities, claims, costs and expenses (including legal expenses and lawyers’ fees) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach by you of this EULA or claims arising directly or indirectly from your use or misuse of the Website or the Game (which also includes Virtual Items), and any negligent or improper use of your device, password and username; and / or any use otherwise than in accordance with the terms of this EULA. You shall fully cooperate with ZA/UM in the defence of any such claim and ZA/UM reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.
    2. You further agree that the subject matter of this EULA is of a unique character with special value and that ZA/UM would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this EULA were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that ZA/UM shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies (including injunctive relief) with respect to breaches of this EULA, in addition to such other remedies as ZA/UM may otherwise have available to it under applicable laws.
    3. ZA/UM’s licensors shall be third-party beneficiaries under this EULA and shall have the express right to enforce its provisions and to enjoy the benefits of its protections.
13. COOLING-OFF RIGHT Where you purchase Virtual Items from a digital store (e.g. Steam, Apple or Google) and you require a refund, that third party store may allow you to get a refund in some circumstances. You should contact the third party through which you made a purchase, where applicable, in the event that you desire a refund. If you make a digital content purchase from ZA/UM directly, you are entitled to cancel the purchase within 14 days and to receive a full refund (your “Cooling-Off Right”). However, where you agree that we may begin to supply you with the digital content before the end of that period, then you will no longer be entitled to change your mind about the purchase and obtain a refund. If you have made a purchase from ZA/UM, have not begun using the content and wish to exercise your Cooling-Off Right you can contact us by email or post using the following form: To: DISCO ELYSIUM UK LIMITED 24 Rivington Street, London, England, EC2A 3DU I hereby give notice that I withdraw from my contract for the following purchase: \[INSERT ORDER ID, ITEM\], for game \[INSERT GAME NAME\], ordered on \[INSERT DATE\].

14. DEVICE AND INTERNET REQUIREMENTS You are responsible for ensuring that you have an internet connection and that the device you use has sufficient system capabilities and memory in order to, as each are applicable, download, install, play and store the Game (and where applicable, Virtual Items). Further information about system requirements for each Game is available on the Game’s relevant store / vendor page (e.g. the Game information page on Steam, for the PC Steam version).
15. DATA PROTECTION Please be aware that any personal data you supply to us when using the Services will be used by us in accordance with our Privacy and Cookie Policy. Please read our Privacy and Cookie Policy carefully.
16. CHANGES TO THIS EULA We may update the terms of this EULA from time to time for any reason by posting the updated version to our website (and/or in-game, if we provide you with this EULA there) but changes to the EULA take effect only where they are permitted by law and made available to you for your agreement. Every time you launch the Game on your device, install or otherwise use the Game, Website or Virtual Items you are deemed to have accepted the latest version of this EULA in place at that time. Please check on our website (and/or in-game, if we provide you with this EULA there) for any updates to the EULA each time you launch the Game on your device.
17. GENERAL
    1. This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between ZA/UM and you in respect of its subject matter.
    2. Even if we delay in enforcing this EULA and/or our rights, we can still enforce this EULA and/or our rights later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under this EULA, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking of any term of this EULA, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
    3. We may transfer our rights and obligations under this EULA to another organisation (such as, without limitation, in the event of a business restructure or acquisition). We will let you know if that happens and we will ensure that your rights under this EULA are unaffected. You may not transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA unless we expressly agree to the transfer in writing.
    4. Except where expressly stated to the contrary in this EULA, this EULA does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this EULA.
    5. In the event that any provision of this EULA (including, without limitation, any restriction) shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted in such a way as to ensure it is enforced to the maximum extent permissible in a manner reflecting the parties’ intentions and the remaining portions of this EULA shall, in any event, remain in full force and effect.
    6. This EULA and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim. In addition you may have the legal right to bring proceedings in your local jurisdiction and, if this is the case, then you may bring proceedings there. For instance if you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the relevant Game in either the Scottish or the English courts.
