INTRODUCTION
------------

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in www.MyAnimeList.net and the MyAnimeList online manga store, and any other MyAnimeList branded websites, online stores, services, subscriptions, offerings, games and applications, and other applications and online services (collectively, the “Service” or “Services”, which also include the MAL Online Manga Store as defined below in Section 18) owned, operated or controlled by MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. (formerly MyAnimeList, LLC) (“MyAnimeList”, “MAL”, “we”, “us”, “our” or “Company”) that link to these Terms of Use. Please read this Terms of Use Agreement document (“Agreement” or “Terms of Use”) carefully because it is legally binding and governs your access to and use of our Service, including any Company Content and User Content (defined below). This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, Members (referenced below), moderators, and others who access or use the Services (“User” or "Users"). All references to “you” or “your,” as applicable, mean the User or other person or entity who accesses or uses the Services in any manner.

By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, MyAnimeList's [Privacy Policy](https://myanimelist.net/about/privacy_policy), and any additional terms and conditions (including, for example, terms and conditions that may be included in MAL Frequently Asked Questions or “FAQ” posts), notices and disclaimers displayed through the Service, whether or not you are a registered user of the Service. You agree that by clicking “Sign Up”, “Join” or other similar registration links or buttons or by accessing or using the Service, **you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with the Company**. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, MyAnimeList's [Privacy Policy](https://myanimelist.net/about/privacy_policy), or any other terms and conditions, notices or disclaimers displayed through the Service, do not click “Sign Up”, “Join” or other similar links or buttons and do not access or use any of our Services.

1\. Amendments to these Terms of Use
------------------------------------

These Terms of Use may be amended by us from time to time and we reserve the right to do so at any time. When we amend these Terms of Use, we will provide notice to you. We may provide you notice of amended Terms of Use by sending an email to the email address associated with your MyAnimeList user account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Service. Any amendments to the Terms of Use will be posted here and the date indicated on the top of the Terms of Use will state the date the Terms of Use were last revised. Continued use of the Service after any amendments to the Terms of Use and after we have provided you notice of the amended Terms of Use constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, you may not access or use the Services and should therefore immediately cease any use of the Services.

2\. Eligibility
---------------

You represent that you are over the age of majority as required by the applicable law of your jurisdiction. If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (e.g. under 18 years of age), you may only use the Service if (a) you obtain parental or legal guardian consent after review of this Agreement prior to you using any of the Service provided by Company and (b) you are competent and fully able to enter into the representations, and warranties, terms, conditions, obligations, and affirmations, set forth in this Agreement, and to comply with and abide by this Agreement. All minors must be directly supervised by their parent or guardian while using our chat rooms. Though Company has the right to monitor the Service, including the chat rooms, Company has no obligation to do so, and Company does not systematically monitor and review the conversations that take place in the chat rooms. Company does not determine the true identity or age of those who frequent and use the Service chat rooms.

Additionally, children under age 13 in the U.S. and children under age 16 in Europe may only use the Service if, and only if, we have obtained verifiable parental consent from their parent or guardian, as discussed in our Privacy Policy. The Company may in its sole discretion for any or no reason, with or without notice, including without limitation if it has not received verifiable parental consent and it believes that you are under 13 in the U.S. or under 16 in Europe, terminate your account or profile, delete any content or information that you have posted on the Service, and/or prohibit you from using or accessing the Service (or any portion, aspect or feature of the Service).

If you do not agree or are not in compliance with these Terms of Use, you may not use our Service.

3\. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------

IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, ARISING OUT, IN CONNECTION WITH OF OR RESULTING THESE TERMS OF USE OR FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE, EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE COMPANY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT NO GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICES, DIGITAL CONTENT (DEFINED BELOW) OR ANY RELATED PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES AS SET FORTH ABOVE, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, IN WHICH CASE THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY TO YOU WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS SET FORTH HEREIN WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVICE.

Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent allowed by applicable law, Company assumes no liability or responsibility, including but not limited to, for any of the following:

* Any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service;
* Errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;
* Any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein;
* User content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.
* Any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our Service by any third party;
* Personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and use of our Service;
* Any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or
* Any damages of any kind suffered by you or claimed to have been suffered by you arising out of or as a result of your use of any third party websites, applications or other services that may link to, be linked to from, access or integrate with our Services.

The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Company has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in Japan, and we may process some data in the United States. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with local law, including but not limited to export and import regulations, to the extent permitted by law. You represent that you are not (1) located in a country that is subject to a Japan or U.S. government embargo, or that has been designated by the Japan or U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and (2) listed on any Japan or U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties. Without limiting the foregoing, software available in connection with the Service may be subject to applicable export controls. No feature, function, software or any component thereof may be downloaded from the Service or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of any applicable export laws. Downloading or using any software is at your sole risk. You further agree not to upload to the Service any data or software that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization.

4\. Use of the Service
----------------------

(A) License and Registration:

Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sub-licensable, revocable, license to use the Service solely for your personal, noncommercial use, and as set forth in this Agreement, provided that (a) you will not alter or modify any part of the Service other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Service for its intended purpose, (b) you will not copy, distribute, or disclose any part of the Service in any medium, and (c) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Company may revoke this license at any time, and in its sole discretion. Upon such revocation, you must promptly destroy all materials downloaded or otherwise obtained from the Service, as well as all copies of such materials, whether made in accordance with these Terms of Use or otherwise.

No registration is required to use the Service. However, in order to access certain features of the Service, registration with Company will be required and you will need to create a "Member" account or other user account or profile. Your account or profile gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.

(B) Paid Premium Features:

Company may offer a paid subscription service where Users may use the Service with Premium Features, including, for example (i) where Members will not see ads hosted by the Service while logged into their accounts, and (ii) receive special discounts for purchases of goods and services from the Service, affiliates and third party partners (“Premium Features”).

Company may also offer one-time purchases for access to Premium Features for a fixed period of time, and may also offer related services such as the ability for users to purchase access to Premium Features for other users (for example, in the form of a gift that can be given to and claimed by another user). Such one-time purchases will expire (if not claimed or used) after 5 months or after such other period of time as may be set forth by Company on the applicable page for such purchases . All payments for such one-time purchases are non-refundable, regardless of whether or not it was used.

MyAnimeList may change the fees or benefits associated with the Premium Features from time to time with reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the Premium Features.

You may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information ("Payment Information") via our Service to purchase Premium Features or other paid products or services. We use third-party service providers to process your Payment Information. If you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that includes these costs and any applicable taxes and fees. By signing up for Premium Features or other paid products or services, you are providing us with your payment account information, you agree to pay the then-current applicable fee listed in the applicable terms and conditions or other agreement and, if applicable, you are signing up to an auto-renewing subscription requiring recurring payments.

If you sign up for a monthly or annual subscription service, you will be charged your first monthly or annual subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your subscription or, if your subscription includes a free trial, on the day after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue on a monthly or annual basis, as applicable, and you will continue to be charged on such monthly or annual basis at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You can find your monthly and/or annual subscription billing date in your account settings.

If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial you will be required to provide a credit card in order to ensure uninterrupted access to the Premium Features and services and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid monthly (or annual, if applicable) subscription and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have cancelled that subscription. You may cancel your monthly or annual subscription as described below. You agree that your payment method may be authorized for up to approximately one month or one year of charges of service, as applicable, as soon as you subscribe. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization; however, no charges will be made against the payment method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial. You may not receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that the paying portion of your monthly or annual subscription has begun. You are only permitted one free trial. If your subscription is ever terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional subscription, you shall not be eligible for a free trial on any subsequent subscriptions.

We may change the subscription terms or fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. If the pricing for your subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging your payment details in connection with an automatic renewal. If we notify you in advance of at least fifteen (15) days, your continued use of the Premium Features or other products and services associated with your subscription after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may cancel your subscription. If you accept the new subscription, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward. For information on the monthly and annual subscription fees and terms, please visit [MAL Supporter Page](https://myanimelist.net/membership).

You may cancel your subscription service at any time in your account settings or by contacting us via our [Customer Support](https://myanimelist.net/about.php?go=support). You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fees to your account. However, if you cancel a pre-paid annual or monthly subscription, you will not receive any refund. If you cancel your monthly or annual subscription, you will be able to use the purchased Premium Features and services for the remainder of your pre-paid subscription term.

We may terminate your subscription at our discretion and without any notice. Fees for such services are refundable in Company's sole discretion. If we cancel your annual subscription, we will give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining in your pre-paid subscription; provided, however, that Company will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Service violates these Terms of Use or has harmed or damaged another user. Otherwise, there is no prorated refund of any fees upon any termination or cancellation.

You agree to immediately pay any amounts accrued, but remaining unpaid, (if any), as of termination of your subscription. You hereby authorize Company to collect fees through various payment methods and information regarding such payment method you provide to us as part of your Member account information, either directly or indirectly via a third party online payment service.

(C) Your Account and Profile Responsibilities:

When creating your account or profile, you must provide complete and accurate information, and you must update your information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your profile or account, and you must keep the password for your profile or account secure at all times. You must notify the Company immediately should there be any unauthorized use or breach of security of your profile or account. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your profile, account or purchase of Premium Features. However, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you shall be liable for any losses incurred by the Company or others due to any unauthorized use of your account, profile or purchase of Premium Features as a result of your wrongdoing, negligence or violation of these Terms of Use. You may never use another Member's profile, account or purchase of Premium Features without permission.

(D) Use of Your Information:

When you provide the Company with your email address, you consent to our using the email address in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Further, to ensure that moderators can be responsive to user and community needs, you understand that such moderators will have access to data associated with your account, including usage data (such as, but not limited to, anime and manga lists with update history and public forum information) and registration data (such as, but not limited to, email address, current and previous usernames, current IP and previous IP addresses associated with registration, login(s) and failed login(s)). You authorize moderators to review such information as reasonably necessary to investigate complaints, respond to appeals, or for such other purposes as contemplated in the Privacy Policy or these Terms of Use.

Please keep in mind that information you provide in any community profiles may be searchable by the general public unless you set your profile to "Private." To change your profile privacy settings, go to your account’s profile page’s account settings, where you may also change your profile information and who can view your page, as well as control how we communicate with you. All postings you make in community forums may be viewed by the public unless such forum topic is designated as “private.”

(E) Certain Prohibited Activities:

You agree not to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes nor collect any personally identifiable information or any account or profile names, from the Service. You also agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "offline readers," "spiders," "robots," etc., that accesses the Service for any malicious purpose or in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser, and you agree not to collate or aggregate any of the content available through the Service for use elsewhere.

(F) Company’s Suspension or Termination of Access:

In the Company's sole discretion, the Company may temporarily or permanently suspend, terminate, or otherwise refuse to permit your access to the Service without notice and liability, if, in Company's sole determination, you violate any provision of the Agreement, including, but not limited to, by carrying out any of the following prohibited actions:

* a. Bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service;
* b. Interfering with the proper working of the Service;
* c. Taking any action that imposes or may impose, at our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
* d. Uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service;
* e. Attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service;
* f. Using the Service in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other Users from fully enjoying the Service or that could damage, disable, overburden, or otherwise impair the functioning of the Service in any manner;

* h. Using the Service to harvest, collect, gather or assemble information or data regarding the Service or Users of the Service except as permitted in these Terms of Use or in a separate agreement with MyAnimeList;

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor User activity, including disputes between you and other Users, and to take any action or not take action in a manner and to the extent we deem appropriate to prevent the violation or further violation of these Terms of Use. Company shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User's action or inaction.

Company is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User Content.

You also understand that we may, from time to time, deploy technology such as application programming interfaces (or “APIs”) for our use or for use by third party application developers (which is further discussed in our [Privacy Policy](https://myanimelist.net/about/privacy_policy)) and you understand and agree that your User Content may be transmitted to and displayed in non-affiliated third party websites or applications that integrate with our APIs.  Further, although we do not expressly allow the scraping of or other extraction of data or other material (e.g., media such as screen shots or video screen captures) from our Services without our prior written consent, you understand and agree that your User Content may be collected and displayed as a result of non-affiliated third parties crawling or scraping the Services or as a result of other data or material harvesting techniques. As such, you understand and agree that your User Content may become publicly available outside of the Services.
