9\. FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT
-----------------------------

The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to obtain from each credit reporting agency a disclosure of all the information in your credit file at the time of the request. Full disclosure of information in your file at a credit reporting agency must be obtained directly from such credit reporting agency. The credit reports provided or requested through our Site are not intended to constitute the disclosure of information by a credit reporting agency as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar laws.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you are entitled to receive an annual free disclosure of your credit report from each of the national credit reporting agencies. To request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must go to [**www.annualcreditreport.com**](http://www.annualcreditreport.com/). You can also contact the central source to request this free annual disclosure by calling toll free (877) 322-8228 or by using the mail request form available at the central source Website.

You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report from a credit reporting agency if:

* You have been denied or were otherwise notified of an adverse action related to credit, insurance, employment, or a government granted license or other government granted benefit within the past sixty (60) days based on information in a credit report provided by such agency.
* You have been denied house/apartment rental or were required to pay a higher deposit than usually required within the past sixty (60) days based on information in a credit report provided by such agency.
* You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment during the sixty (60) day period beginning on the date on which you made such certification.
* You certify in writing that you are a recipient of public welfare assistance.
* You certify in writing that you have reason to believe that your file at such credit reporting agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud.

In addition, if you reside in the state of Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or Vermont, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report once a year and if you reside in the state of Georgia, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report twice a year. For Illinois residents, credit reporting agencies are required by law to give you a copy of your credit record upon request at no charge or for a nominal fee. Otherwise, a consumer credit reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for providing you with a copy of your credit report.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides that you may dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit report. YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PURCHASE YOUR CREDIT REPORT FROM ANY OF THE CREDIT BUREAUS IN ORDER TO DISPUTE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION IN YOUR REPORT OR TO RECEIVE A COPY OF YOUR REPORT FROM EQUIFAX, EXPERIAN OR TRANSUNION, THE THREE NATIONAL CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES, OR FROM ANY OTHER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY.

It may be the policies of Equifax, Experian and/or TransUnion to provide a complimentary copy of the consumer credit report under circumstances other than those described above. If you wish to contact Equifax, Experian or TransUnion to obtain a copy of your credit report directly from such agency or if you wish to dispute information contained in an Equifax, Experian or TransUnion credit report file, please contact such entities as follows:

Experian: 1-800-EXPERIAN (1-888-397-3742)

Equifax: 1-800-685-1111

TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800

10\. APPLICABLE LAW
-------------------

We perform the Services through our corporate headquarters located in the State of Texas. This Agreement shall be governed, interpreted, and enforced according to the laws of the State of Texas, regardless of Texas conflict of laws. Subject to Section 11 below (which provides for arbitration of claims between us to the maximum extent possible), you irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Travis County, Texas for any dispute or litigation arising out of, relating to, or the use or purchase of Services from CSID.

11\. ARBITRATION
----------------

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION**

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

SUMMARY:

MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTION BY CALLING CSID’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 855-591-0202. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT CSID’S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING A SERVICE OR WEBSITE TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF CSID HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IT HAS WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. CSID WILL PAY ALL COSTS OF ARBITRATION, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS. HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND CSID WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.

Arbitration Agreement:  
(a) CSID and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us arising out of this Agreement directly related to the Services or Websites, except any disputes or claims which under governing law are not subject to arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between us directly relating to the provision of any Service and/or your use of any Website subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. The agreement to arbitrate otherwise includes, but is not limited to:

claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us arising out of any Service or Website, whether based in contract, tort, statute (including, without limitation, the Credit Repair Organizations Act) fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to “CSID,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services and/or Websites or information under this or prior Agreements between us relating to Services and/or Websites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and CSID are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

You may obtain more information about arbitration from [**www.adr.org**](http://www.adr.org/).

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable or refuses to arbitrate the parties’ dispute for any reason, the arbitration shall be administered and conducted by a widely-recognized arbitration organization that is mutually agreeable to the parties, but neither party shall unreasonably withhold their consent. If the parties cannot agree to a mutually agreeable arbitration organization, one shall be appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act. In all events, the AAA Rules shall govern the parties’ dispute. The AAA Rules are available online at [**www.adr.org**](http://www.adr.org/) by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.

All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as well as the Agreement’s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. However if putative class or representative claims are initially brought by either party in a court of law, and a motion to compel arbitration is brought by any party, then the court shall have the power to decide whether this agreement permits class or representative proceedings. The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall follow the applicable law. In this regard, the arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award rendered by the arbitrator that employs an error of law or legal reasoning may be vacated or corrected by a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Unless CSID and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, CSID will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse CSID for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.

The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding or in the final award, pursuant to applicable law and the AAA Rules.

Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.

YOU AND CSID AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CSID agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph is found to be unenforceable in its entirety, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. However, if only a portion of this subparagraph is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of this subparagraph enforced. Any claims not subject to individual arbitration under applicable law shall be stayed in a court of competent jurisdiction pending completion of the individual arbitration.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if CSID makes any change to this arbitration provision during your membership in any Service, including credit monitoring, or subsequent to your purchase of any Service, you may reject any such change and require CSID to adhere to the language in this provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase if a dispute between us arises regarding such Service.

12\. INDEMNIFICATION
--------------------

YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS US, OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OF INFORMATION OR SERVICES TO THE SITE FROM AND AGAINST ALL LOSSES, EXPENSES, DAMAGES AND COSTS, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES, RESULTING FROM ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE SUBJECT TO ANY CLAIM FOR WHICH WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE INDEMNIFIED BY YOU, WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO, AT YOUR EXPENSE, ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY SUCH CLAIM, AND YOU WILL NOT IN ANY EVENT SETTLE ANY CLAIM WITHOUT OUR PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT.

13\. EXPERIAN CREDITLOCK – ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
----------------------------------------------------------

(Applicable only if Experian CreditLock is available in your Product)

By requesting an Experian CreditLock to be placed on your behalf, you are requesting to restrict most third party access to your Experian credit report. You acknowledge that your Experian credit report, when locked with Experian CreditLock, may still be accessible by third parties in certain instances deemed to be low-risk by CSID, including access to your Experian credit report by the following third parties: (1) You, as part of any Product offering Experian CreditLock as a benefit; (2) potential employers or insurance companies; (3) companies that have an existing credit relationship with you; (4) collection agencies acting on behalf of companies or individuals on a debt you may owe and related collection activities; (5) government agencies in connection to a child support claim, or government investigations; (6) personalized credit opportunities and other offers for products or services that may be available to You through CSID or through unaffiliated third parties, such as credit card offers, if you choose to receive them; and (7) companies providing pre-screened credit card offers. Please understand that your Experian credit report will be unlocked if you cancel a Product that includes Experian CreditLock as a benefit, or downgrade to a Product that does not include Experian CreditLock as a benefit.

Your Experian CreditLock will restrict delivery of your Experian credit report only, and does not apply to your TransUnion or Equifax credit report. To lock or place a security freeze on your Equifax or TransUnion credit report, you will need to contact those bureaus directly. While Experian CreditLock may include some functionality similar to security freeze programs required under certain laws, you acknowledge that Experian CreditLock is a separate service from, and not equivalent to, such security freeze programs. For more information about the Experian security freeze program please contact CSID at (855)591-0202.

14\. DIGITAL IDENTITY MANAGER™ (aka Data Broker Removal)
--------------------------------------------------------

(Applicable only if Digital Identity Manager is available in your Service)

You authorize CSID to send your personal information from your account profile on a one-time, periodic or recurring basis to its service provider(s) in order for them to store and use your information to perform searches or scans for your information on the covered people finder sites listed within the service (“Personal Privacy Scans”), to return results of such scans for your review, and to request removal of your information on your behalf when records are found (“Automated Opt-Out Requests”) (if and to the extent available within your subscription and activated by you). Personal Privacy Scans (beyond an initial free scan that may be initiated by CSID pursuant to this consent), recurring scans, and the Automated Opt-Out Requests may only be available with certain paid subscriptions or services. You acknowledge that Personal Privacy Scans involve the inputting, searching, and/or communication of your information to the third party people finder sites in order to determine if your information is stored on or by the covered sites, and you agree to such use of your personal information. The list of covered people finder sites is subject to change without notice. CSID may select which people finder sites to scan from the full list of available sites and may vary such selection on a scan-by-scan basis at its (or its service provider’s) sole discretion. By activating the Automated Opt-Out Requests, you explicitly authorize CSID and its service provider(s) to attempt on your behalf, as your authorized agent, to effectuate data subject access requests and to have your information removed from the covered sites where your information is found. While some removal requests will be automated on your behalf, you acknowledge that such removal requests are not automatically granted, are not guaranteed to be successfully communicated, and may not be honored by all covered sites under all circumstances and for reasons outside of our or our service providers’ control. The status of any removal attempts will be displayed in your account dashboard. You may need to manually request removal of your information from particular covered sites if/when a removal request is not successful or is not honored. Attempts to remove your information may be subject to the terms and practices of each covered site, are at the discretion of the covered sites, and may not result in the complete deletion of your information from all of a covered site’s systems and databases. Paid Digital Identity Manager features or services can be cancelled by changing to a subscription that does not include the features or services or by cancelling any standalone Digital Identity Manager offerings. Please understand that by cancelling such paid features or services, your recurring scans and Automated Opt-Out Requests will be terminated (although pending requests may be attempted for a limited time post-cancellation). By cancelling, you may still be eligible for and provided with a free scan occasionally, at the sole discretion of CSID.

15\. CSID PASSWORD MANAGER, CSID SAFE BROWSER, and CSID SECURE VPN
------------------------------------------------------------------

(Applicable only if CSID Password Manager, CSID Safe Browser, and/or CSID Secure VPN, is available in your Service)

1. The Password Manager is a digital identity management service that gives you the ability to save your passwords, credentials, frequently visited websites and favorite websites by storing all passwords, notes and form-filling data. Your passwords will be encrypted on your device using a master password that only you know. You only need to remember this master password to open your Password Manager and decrypt your encrypted passwords on your device. After being encrypted on your device your passwords will be sent to Anonyome Labs (or a third-party vendor) in an encrypted format through a secure connection for storage in order to enable synchronization with your other devices. Experian never stores your master password on any server so your passwords cannot be retrieved by anyone but you.
2. If you decide to use the Services, you will have access to the following features: When the Password Manager is open it will automatically detect passwords while you browse and give you the option to encrypt and save them to your Password Manager Vault. You can decide to turn off this feature at any time in the settings section of the Password Manager. When the Password Manager is open it will prompt you with an auto-fill option on the web pages you are visiting. If you choose to, you can select the recommended username and password of the online accounts you have stored in Password Manager for that web page and will automatically log you in. You can also store credit card numbers and bank account numbers in the Password Manager Vault. The entries will be encrypted with your master password and only accessible by you. In accordance with Section 14, you are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of your master password. By using Password Manager you acknowledge and agree that Experian is not responsible for any loss or damage to you or to any third party incurred as a result of any unauthorized access and/or use of your master password, or otherwise.
3. By downloading the Password Manager, Safe Browser, and/or Secure VPN, you understand and expressly agree that the Password Manager, Safe Browser, and/or Secure VPN logo (button) will be installed and will appear on your browser or your mobile operating system in order to quickly access the Password Manager, Safe Browser, and/or Secure VPN. These and other Services may not be available at all times. These services require Experian and third parties, including its service providers (including cloud service providers), access to your sensitive internet browsing history and information. While encryption is an added layer of security, encrypted traffic can be intercepted and decrypted/cracked with various infiltration tools and methods. Moreover, any information you willingly share with a third party or website may be unencrypted and therefore readable to said third party or website. By downloading the Password Manager, Safe Browser, and/or Secure VPN, you agree to accept all risks relating to any transmission of information to Experian or third parties, including its service providers over the internet.
4. The following general activities are expressly prohibited when using Secure VPN or in connection with any email transmitted or received via Secure VPN or Safe Browser:

1. 1. “Phishing,” that is, simulating communications from Experian and/or the Website or other service of another entity to collect identity information, authentication credentials, or other information from the legitimate users of that entity’s service.
    2. “Pharming,” that is, using malware, DNS cache poisoning or other means to redirect a user to a website or other service that simulates a service offered by a legitimate entity to collect identity information, authentication credentials, or other information from users of that entity’s service.
    3. Furnishing false or incorrect data on the signup form.
    4. Falsifying header information or user identification information.
    5. Sending unsolicited (“opt-out”) bulk email. Users sending bulk email using the Services may only engage in such activity using “closed-loop opt-in” lists. Such users who send bulk email through “closed-loop opt-in” lists must have a method of confirmation or verification of subscriptions and be able to show evidence of subscription for users who complain about receiving unsolicited email.
    6. Sending or collecting responses from mass unsolicited email messages.
    7. Deliberately sending excessively large attachments to one or more email recipients.
    8. Transmitting unsolicited commercial email messages.
    9. Maintaining an open mail relay and/or an open proxy.
    10. Collecting email addresses from the Internet for the purpose of sending unsolicited bulk email or to provide collected addresses to others for that purpose.
    11. Using email to engage in harassment, whether through language, frequency, or size of messages. Continuing to send someone email after being asked to stop is considered harassment.
    12. Using email to disrupt (e.g., mail bombing, “flashing,” etc.).
    13. Originating email with falsified or obscured information (e.g., encoded or obfuscated URLs) designed to hinder identification of the location of what is advertised.
    14. Originating chain letters, pyramid schemes, and hoaxes.
    15. Using another party’s email server to relay email without express permission from such other party.
    16. Using the VPN product to collect replies to messages sent from another provider that violate these rules or those of the other provider.
    17. Using the VPN product services in connection with or in support of the running of a mail server without a license to run such a server in any jurisdiction where such license is required.
    18. Using the VPN product in any way that violates applicable federal, state, local or international law or regulation (including, without limitation, any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other countries).

16\. YOUR PASSWORDS AND ACCOUNT SECURITY
----------------------------------------

You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords associated with any account you use to access the Services. Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to us for all activities that occur under your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify us immediately.

17\. TERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP
--------------------------------

1. These Terms of Use will continue to apply until terminated by either you or us as set out below.
2. If you want to terminate your legal agreement with us, you may do so, with or without cause, by (a) notifying us at any time and (b) closing your accounts for all of the Services which you use, where we have made this option available to you. Please contact us to close your account.
3. We may at any time terminate our legal agreement with you with or without cause (and for any or no reason). We may also terminate our legal agreement with you if, among other reasons:
    1. you have breached any provision of the Terms of Use (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms of Use);
    2. we are required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or
    3. the provision of the Services to you by us is, in our opinion, no longer commercially viable.
4. If we terminate your Service without cause, CSID will refund to you a pro rata portion of any fees already paid directly to CSID for the Services that have yet to be provided. If this Agreement has not been terminated, it shall continue indefinitely, and you shall pay the corresponding fees for the Services. When this Agreement terminates, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and we have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time while the Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this termination and/or cessation, and the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6 and 10-16, inclusive, shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

18\. MISCELLANEOUS
------------------

1. No waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms of Use or of any agreement with us will constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or other provisions. All waivers must be in writing. If any court of competent jurisdiction finds any part or provision of these Terms of Use or of any other agreement between you and us to be invalid or unenforceable, such findings will have no effect on any other part or provision of these Terms of Use or any other agreement between you and us. All waivers must be in writing.
2. We are not responsible for delay or failure to perform due to causes beyond our reasonable control.
3. The Terms of Use constitute the whole legal agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which we may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and us in relation to the Services.
4. Except as otherwise provided, we may send any notices to you to the most recent e-mail address you have provided to us or, if you have not provided an e-mail address, to any e-mail or postal address that we believe is your address. If you wish to update your registration information, please log in to your account and update your information.
