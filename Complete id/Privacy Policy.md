CSIdentity Corporation (d/b/a Complete ID) (“we,” “us” and “our”) respects individual privacy and values the confidence of our subscribers.  We want you to be familiar with what information we collect about you, how the information is being used and what choices you have regarding the collection and use of the information.  The privacy principles that we follow with respect to the collection, use, disclosure and protection of information in the course of providing our products and services are consistent with relevant U.S. federal and state laws.

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to and describes our privacy practices and principles in connection with Complete ID consumers who access this website.  The Policy covers information that we collect directly from you and/or family plan member(s), automatically when you interact with our websites and mobile applications and from third party data sources.

We may share aggregated and de-identified information with third parties for any purpose.

We and our service providers, including analytics and advertising partners, collect information automatically when you access and use the Site which we will store in log files.  The types of information collected and how that information is used depends on how you interact with the Site and choices you make including:

The Site collects and uses session and persistent cookies.  Session cookies expire when you close your browser and are used to store your preferences and settings. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track various internal metrics and track and target the interests of our website visitors to enhance their experience on our Site.  We may use cookies to determine whether you are already a CompleteID consumer and share that information with our marketing partners and/or service providers so they can provide you with relevant information about other products and services.
* Tracking Technologies: In addition to cookies, the Site automatically collects and uses other tracking technologies, including web beacons which are electronic images also called pixel tags or clear gifs. These technologies collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services.  The Site also collects your activity on our Site, links that you click on and pages viewed, the URL of the website you came from and emails that you opened or forwarded.  That information is used for a variety of purposes including Site administration, performance, custom content and improvements; enabling you to enroll and log-in to the Site; tracking Site usage and user movements; delivering and tailoring interest-based advertising; developing of new products and services and fraud prevention.  We and/or our service providers also share the information we collect with third parties for these purposes.  We have access to reports produced by service providers that contain aggregated trends and statistics about website usage on our proprietary platforms.
* Device and Identifiers: The Site collects information about your devices and other identifiers including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browsers, device type identifiers and operating systems.  This information will be used to analyze trends, track users’ movements on our site and gather demographic information about the Site’s users as a whole.  If you access our website using a mobile device, we also collect information about your mobile device, such as the device ID or another identifier as permitted by the manufacturer.
