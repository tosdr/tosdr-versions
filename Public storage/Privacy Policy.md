5\. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
-------------------------------------------

We, and our third-party service providers, use cookies, pixels, and other tracking mechanisms (collectively, “Cookies”) to track information about your use of our website or Services.

**Cookies.** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our website and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our website. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

* **Session Cookies.** Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into your account with us. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity after you have logged in, as you move through our website and Services.
* **Persistent Cookies.** Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser or turned off your device. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

**Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags, and other Technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web and app pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our website to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors and app users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

**Third-Party Analytics.** We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site, and to the extent permitted, our Apps. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our website. We use these tools to help us improve our Site’s and Apps’ performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons, to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

**Cross-Device Use.** We may use the Personal Information that we collect about you to help us and our third-party service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer, etc.). We and our third-party service providers also may use the cross-device use and other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails. To opt out of cross-device advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth in the “How to Manage Cookies” section below. Please note: if you opt-out of these targeted advertising cookies, your opt-out will be specific to the web browser, app, or device from which you accessed the opt-out. If you use multiple devices or web browsers, you will need to opt out on each browser or device that you use.

**Session Replay**. We may use session replay technologies to diagnose problems with our Services and identify areas for improvement. Session replay allows us to collect your activities on our website, including your clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, and input data. 

**Do-Not-Track.** Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt out of targeted advertising by following the instructions below.

### 5.1 How We Use Cookies

We use Cookies for the following purposes:

* **Website Operation.** Cookies help us run our website securely and enable basic functions like page navigation.
    
* **Performance and Analytics.** Cookies help us analyze how you interact with our website. This enables us to monitor and improve our website performance, services, and your experience.
    
* **Advertisements.** Cookies allow us to deliver advertisements that are meaningful to you. Our third party advertising partners may use the Cookies to build a profile of your interests, deliver relevant advertising on other sites, and measure the efficiency of the advertisements.
    

### 5.2 How to Manage Cookies

To prevent cookies or third-party advertisers from tracking your activity on our Site or visits across multiple websites, there are tools you can use to disable cookies and opt out of interest-based advertising. Using the resources below does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site, Services, or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular Site that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads) and as described above. Your opt-out may not be effective if your browser is configured to reject cookies.

* **Browser Solutions for Disabling Cookies.** To prevent Cookies from tracking your activity on our website or visits across multiple websites, you can set your browser to block certain Cookies or notify you when a Cookie is set. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your device from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site and Services who disable cookies will be able to browse the Site, but some features may not function.
    
* **Industry Solutions for Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising.** Not withstanding the above, visitors to our Website may follow the steps provided by initiatives that educate users on how to set tracking preferences for most online advertising tools, such as the Network Advertising Initiative (https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) in the US, the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (https://youradchoices.ca/en/learn), the Data Driven Advertising Initiative in Japan (http://www.ddai.info/optout), or other similar services. You can use the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AdChoices opt-out tool (https://youradchoices.com/control) to opt out of the use of your Personal Information by many third-party ad networks for targeted advertising purpose. The Digital Advertising Alliance also offers an application called AppChoices (https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) that helps users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.
    

6\. Information Regarding Children
----------------------------------

Our website and Services are intended for users who are 18 years or older and we do not knowingly collect information from children under 18 years old. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 18 years old, we will delete such information from our records. If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe your child has given us information and you did not provide consent, please contact us at 800.611.2882.

7\. Your Rights and Choices

### 7.3 Additional Privacy Information for Certain Jurisdictions

Residents of certain jurisdictions have additional rights under applicable privacy laws, as described in this section. If you are a resident of California, please review [Section 7.3.2](#policy-7.3.2) for a description of your rights pursuant to California privacy laws.

### 7.3.1 Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia

Residents of other U.S. states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia, may also have rights under applicable privacy laws, subject to certain limitations, which may include:

### **How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights**

To submit a request to exercise these rights you may use one of the following three methods:

* [**Webform**](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/5a07fe67-0805-40d0-97ec-b3cae4f455ea/e18050aa-e215-4107-9dda-1ae655117df0) powered by OneTrust
* **Mail:** Public Storage, Attention: Privacy Officer, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201
* **Telephone:** 800.611.2882

For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your \[State\] Privacy Rights,” indicate which type of request you are making. Please provide us with the following information: (1) first and last name; (2) email address; and (3) zip code. We will take steps to verify your request by matching the information provided by you with the information we have in our records. If we are unable to adequately verify a request, we will notify the requestor.

We may deny your request if (1) we are not reasonably capable of associating your request with the Personal Information or it would be unreasonably burdensome for us to associate your request with the Personal Information; (2) we do not use the Personal Information to recognize or respond to you specifically or associate the Personal Information with other Personal Information about you; and (3) we do not sell the Personal Information to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the Personal Information to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted under applicable law.

To opt out of sales and targeted advertising by us, you can adjust your cookies settings by clicking the Cookie Preferences Link at the bottom of our website homepage or download an opt-out preference signal, such as the "global privacy control" (or GPC). We will respond to your request as required under the applicable privacy law(s).

If we decline to take action regarding your request, you may have the right to appeal. We will notify you providing our reasons and instructions for how you can appeal the decision. If the appeal is denied, we will provide a way for you contact your state’s Attorney General to submit a complaint.

### 7.3.2 California

If you are a California Resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").

If we collected Personal Information about you in your role as an applicant, employee, or independent contractor, this Policy does not apply to you. Please contact the Public Storage Human Resources Department if you have questions about Personal Information related to your application or work with Public Storage. Additionally, if we collected Personal Information about you in your role as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a commercial client, investor, or developer this Policy does not apply to you.

### The Right to Know/Access

With respect to the personal information we have collected about you, you may have the right to request more information about how we have treated your Personal Information in the past 12 months, including:

* The categories of Personal Information we collected about you;
* The categories of sources from which we collected that information;
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that information;
* The categories of third parties with whom we shared that information; and
* The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you.

The categories of Personal Information we collect, our purposes for using Personal Information, and parties to whom we may disclose Personal Information are described in Sections 2, 3, and 4 of this Privacy Policy.

### The Right to Delete

Under certain conditions, you have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information. Please note that simply logging out or uninstalling an app does not delete your account or the Personal Information we may have collected.

### The Right to Correct

You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information. You may update your Personal Information with us at any time by using the methods described in [Section 7.1](#policy-7.1) above.

### The Right to Opt-Out

California residents may have the right to opt-out of “sales” or “sharing” of their Personal Information under the CCPA. The CCPA defines a “sale” as disclosing or making available to a third-party Personal Information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and “sharing” broadly includes disclosing or making available Personal Information to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. While we do not receive monetary compensation from third parties when we disclose Personal Information, we may disclose the following categories of Personal Information with third party advertising companies, marketing companies, social media platforms, and analytics partners for targeted advertising, marketing, and campaign management purposes: identifiers, internet and network activity information, and other information about how you interact with our websites or mobile applications. This may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” as broadly defined by the CCPA.

You can request to opt out of “sales” or “sharing” of your Personal Information by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link in the website footer, to turn off targeted advertising cookies. Please note that your Cookie settings are device and browser specific—so, if you come to our website from another device or browser, you will need to reapply your settings. Please note that submitting an opt out request will only opt you out of disclosures that are considered “sales” or “sharing” under the CCPA, but it will not opt out of other disclosures, such as to our service providers.

You may also opt-out of “sales” and “sharing” of your Personal Information, through the use of an opt-out preference signal. If our website detects that your browser or device is transmitting an opt-out preference signal, such as the “global privacy control”—or GPC— signal, we will opt that browser or device out of cookies on our website that result in a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. Please note, if you come to our website from a different device or a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt out, or use an opt-out preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well.

We do not sell or share sensitive personal information, nor do we sell or share any Personal Information about individuals who we know are under sixteen (16) years old.

### Right to Limit Use and Disclosure

Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, you may have the right to limit the use and disclosure of “Sensitive Personal Information,” as defined under the CPRA. However, we do not engage in activities triggering this right.

### The Right to Non-Discrimination

We will not unlawfully discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.

### How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights

To submit a request to exercise these rights you may use one of the following three methods:

* [**Webform**](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/5a07fe67-0805-40d0-97ec-b3cae4f455ea/e18050aa-e215-4107-9dda-1ae655117df0) powered by OneTrust
* **Mail:** Public Storage, Attention: Privacy Officer, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201
* **Telephone:** 800.611.2882

For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your California Privacy Rights,” indicate which type of request you are making, and provide your name, street address, city, state, zip code and an e-mail address or phone number where you may be contacted.
