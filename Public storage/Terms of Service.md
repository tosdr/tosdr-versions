### 6\. Updates to the Terms

These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR SERVICE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SERVICE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SERVICE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the posted terms of use and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Service will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently check the home page and the email you associated with your account for notices, and you agree that the means set forth in these Terms are all reasonable manners of providing you with notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Service and related services.

### 7\. Registration, Password and Security

Whenever you provide us information on our Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information; and (b) maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that the information is, untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, Public Storage may without notice suspend or terminate your access to our Service and refuse any and all current or future use of our Service (or any portion thereof). In order to access or use some (or potentially all) of the features on the Service, you may be required to first register for a user account through our registration process that we make available through the Service (and purchase a subscription as described in Section 3 above). The Service’s practices governing any resulting collection and use of your personal information are disclosed in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.publicstorage.com/privacy.html) . If any portion of our Service requires you to register or open an account you may also be asked to choose a password and a username. Please select a password that would not be obvious to someone trying to guess your password, and change it regularly as an added precaution. We may reject the use of any password, username, or e-mail address for any other reason in our sole discretion; (ii) You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete registration information about yourself in connection with the registration process and, as permitted, to maintain and update it continuously and promptly to keep it accurate, current, and complete; (iii) You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, password, and username – whether or not you authorized the activity; (iv) You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your Device so that others may not access any password protected portion of the Service using your name, username, or password; (v) You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, password, or username, or any other breach of security; and (vi) You will not sell, transfer, or assign your account or any account rights. Without limiting any rights which Public Storage may otherwise have, Public Storage reserves the right to take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable, to ensure the security of the Service and your account, including, without limitation, terminating your account, changing your password, or requesting additional information to authorize transactions on your account. Notwithstanding the above, Public Storage may rely on the authority of anyone accessing your account or using your password and in no event and under no circumstances shall Public Storage be held liable to you for any liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of: (i) any action or inaction of Public Storage under this provision, (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your account or password, or (iii) any unauthorized access to your account or use of your password. You may not use anyone else's account at any time, without the permission of the account holder.

The security of your personally identifying information is important to us. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take reasonable steps to help ensure the safety of your personally identifying information. However, you understand and agree that such steps do not guarantee that use of the Service is invulnerable to all security breaches, and that Public Storage makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation that use of any of our Service is protected from viruses, security threats, or other vulnerabilities.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage (of any kind and under any legal theory) to you or any third party arising from your inability or failure for any reason to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.

Public Storage  
Attention: Litigation & Operations Counsel  
701 Western Avenue  
Glendale, California 91201  
E-mail: **[\[email protected\]](https://www.publicstorage.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**

It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. Public Storage may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Public Storage may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability. We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.

Without limiting Public Storage’s other rights, Public Storage may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer’s access to the Service and any other website owned or operated by Public Storage.

**B. Counter-Notification**. If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to Public Storage is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above. Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:

(i) a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Counter-Notification”;  
(ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL or page of the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);  
(iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;  
(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account;  
(v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and  
(vi) your electronic or physical signature.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service. You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

Each time you submit any User Submissions, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside or are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User Submissions you submit, and that, as to that User Submissions: (a) you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other rights to the User Submissions, or you have a lawful right to submit the User Submissions and grant Public Storage the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms and any Additional Terms, all without any Public Storage obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of Public Storage; (b) the User Submissions is accurate; (c) the User Submissions does not and, as to Public Storage’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d) the User Submissions will not violate these Terms (including the Rules) or any Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person.

**B. Community Usage Rules**. As a user of the Service, these Community Usage Rules (“Rules”) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of visitors of the Service’s online forums (“Communities”).

**(i) Nature of Rules**. Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:

* **Your User Submissions**. All of your User Submissions either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms. Your User Submissions should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties. Do not use any User Submissions that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet. If anyone contributes to your User Submissions or has any rights to your User Submissions, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User Submissions, then you must also have their permission to submit such User Submissions to Public Storage (for example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to Public Storage as your User Submissions, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so.).
* **Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family**. If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.
* **Act Appropriately**. All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy. If you think your User Submissions might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the Service. Cursing, harassing, bullying, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. Your User Submissions must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap. Your User Submissions must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.
* **Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes**. Your User Submissions must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.
* **Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes**. Your User Submissions must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
* **Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User Submissions**. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User Submissions that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.
* **Others Can See**. We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions about job search-related issues with other members. However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User Submissions that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.
* **Don’t Share Other Peoples’ Personal Information**. Your User Submissions should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, e-mail address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by Public Storage.
* **Don’t Damage the Service or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices**. Your User Submissions must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.

 

If you submit User Submissions that Public Storage reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion. However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law. We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us. Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User Submissions in question being removed from the Service.

**(ii) Your Interactions With Other Users; Disputes**. You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.

### 13\. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THE PUBLIC STORAGE PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, LOSS OF DATA, OR OTHER DEFECT RELATED TO THE SERVICE OR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE PUBLIC STORAGE PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES.

### 18\. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

**PLEASE READ THESE PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS**

**18.1. Notice; Process**  
Before filing a claim against us in any forum, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by notifying us of your claim by sending an email to **[\[email protected\]](https://www.publicstorage.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)** or sending a letter to the Dispute Resolution Department, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201. The notice must specifically describe the nature of the dispute and the relief you seek. You will give us sixty (60) days from the date we receive your notice to try to resolve the dispute. Either party may file a claim if the dispute is not resolved after sixty (60) days.

**18.2. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**  
Both you and Public Storage agree that any and all dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Public Storage arising in connection with or in any way relating to the relationship between you and Public Storage, including your use of the Public Storage online bill paying service, will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Public Storage further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. By agreeing to arbitrate, both parties are giving up the right to proceed in court. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as in court, except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreement.

**18.3 Arbitration Rules**  
The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (**“JAMS”**) then in effect and as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. To the extent JAMS is not available in your state, the arbitration will be governed and administered by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (**“AAA”**) then in force (the **“AAA Rules”**), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For all claims and counterclaims together valued at less than $25,000, you and Public Storage agree that arbitration must proceed as a documents-only hearing, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by both parties. You and Public Storage agree that the right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement is protected by, and any arbitration will be governed by, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.). You and Public Storage agree that our business and the relationship here involve interstate commerce. The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

**18.4 Exceptions**  
Notwithstanding Section 18.2 above, both you and Public Storage agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to seek remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within that court's jurisdiction. Both parties also retain the right to pursue any eviction, action to enforce a lien, and/or unlawful detainer remedies or defenses in any court. You agree that Public Storage retains the right to conduct a lien sale. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not stop you or Public Storage from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, who may seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa) to the extent allowed by law. Any other claims, however, such as claims for violations of the self-storage lien laws, derivative claims (including, but not limited to, claims under state consumer protection statutes), conversion, negligence, breach of contract, or other violations of state or federal law, must be brought in arbitration.

**18.5 No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver**  
YOU AND PUBLIC STORAGE BOTH AGREE TO GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND PUBLIC STORAGE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. Unless you and Public Storage agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, consolidated action or private attorney general action. If this specific provision, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void except Section 18.1, which shall remain in full force and effect.

### 19\. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the use of our Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and us regarding such subject matter. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Service. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all Devices and other equipment and software, and all internet service provider, mobile service, and other services needed for your access to and use of the Service and you will be responsible for all charges related to them. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Subject to Section 18.5 above, if any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Neither the course of conduct nor course of dealing between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms. Public Storage may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you. Your rights and duties under these Terms are not assignable by you without our written consent. The provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms (including the terms applicable to User Submissions), which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to Public Storage in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration. These Terms do not provide any third party with any remedy, claim, or right of reimbursement. Except where the context otherwise requires, wherever used, the singular shall include the plural, the plural the singular and the word “or” is used in the inclusive sense (and/or). The term “including” as used herein shall mean including, without limiting the generality of any description preceding such term (regardless of whether the term “including” is followed by words such as “but not limited to” or “without limitation” in some provisions but not others). The headings in these Terms are for the sole purpose of convenience of reference and shall not in any way limit or affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the provisions of these Terms.
