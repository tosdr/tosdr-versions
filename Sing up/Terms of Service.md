### [6\. Sing Up Accounts](https://www.singup.org/terms-and-conditions)

**6.1.** **Sing Up user account.** When signing up with Sing Up as a member of staff or independent provider, a user account (“Sing Up user account”, “Sing Up user”) is created. This user account can be a trial account ("Sing Up Friend" account), or can be attached to a single-user Membership account (e.g. Choir Leader Membership), or a multi-user Membership account (e.g. account owned by a school or organisation). A Sing Up user can at any time become part of a Membership account, move Membership accounts, or detach from a Membership account and become a trial account again. Sing Up user accounts are not subject to an expiry date and will remain registered until the account is closed either by yourself or by Sing Up (subject to 9.4. to 9.6.).

**6.2. Trial account.** A Sing Up user not attached to a Membership account, will enjoy the benefits of a trial account ("Sing Up Friend" account) with full access to a limited number of selected trial resources, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free. Any non-trial resources can be previewed only. Trial account users have the ability to purchase Sing Up Membership by purchasing first time Membership for a new Membership account (single-user or multi-user Membership account) or by renewing Membership for an existing Membership account (multi-user Membership account only). Sing Up Friend account users can also get access to Membership resources by applying to join an existing Membership account (multi-user Membership account only) if they are an employee of a school or organisation.

**6.3. Single-user Membership account.** When purchasing a single-user Membership (e.g. Choir Leader Membership), this Membership is assigned to a single-user Membership account. The Sing Up user, who placed the Membership order, will receive access to this Membership account.

Active single-user Membership accounts include access to Membership benefits as stated on the Site. Expired or dormant single-user Membership accounts enjoy full access to a limited number of selected trial resources, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free. Any non-trial resources can be previewed only. Any resources downloaded, unlocked, or saved while having active single-user Membership will be remembered and saved, but will be locked until the Membership has been renewed.

Single-user Membership accounts belong to and are used by one individual, and thus access to Sing Up resources through this Membership account cannot be shared by more than one individual. The Sing Up user, who placed the first Membership order for this account, will be identified as the owner of the single-user Membership account. Ownership of a single-user Membership account is not transferable.

**6.4. Multi-user Membership account.** A school, Music Education Hub, Music Service, Multi-Academy Trust, or any other organisation is represented within Sing Up by a multi-user Membership account, and all Sing Up Memberships for the school or organisation will be attached to this Membership account.

If a school or organisation is not yet registered with Sing Up, a new multi-user Membership account can be created during the purchase of the first-time Membership.

Active multi-user Membership accounts include access to Membership benefits as stated on the Site. Expired or dormant multi-user Membership accounts enjoy full access to a limited number of selected trial resources, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free. Any non-trial resources can be previewed only. Any resources downloaded, unlocked, and saved while having active Membership will be remembered and saved, but will be locked until the Membership has been renewed.

Multi-user Membership accounts belong to the school or organisation and access to the Membership account and Membership benefits can be shared by more than one Sing Up user, so long as the Sing Up users are current employees of the school or organisation (subject to 7.2.).  
Multi-user Membership accounts belonging to a Music Education Hub, Music Service, Multi-Academy Trust, or similar ("partner organisation") (subject to [Additional Terms - Sing Up Partner Membership](https://www.singup.org/partner-terms)) include one free of charge Sing Up user with access the Membership account. Additional Sing Up users over and above the one free user are chargeable, unless otherwise stated, and will need to be arranged with Sing Up.  
There are no restrictions on the number of Sing Up users that can be authorised to access a multi-user Membership account belonging to a school or any other organisation.

**6.5. Student account.** A Student user account (“Student user") is created by a Sing Up user with access to a multi-user Membership account belonging to a school. A Student user account cannot be created independently of the Membership account (“parent Membership account”, “parent account”) and cannot move Membership accounts. Until deleted, a Student user account stays part of the Membership account it was created under.

The owner of the Membership account is taking responsibility of any student data submitted to Sing Up, and in complying with data protection laws applicable. Students & Groups Manager administrators are taking responsibility for the management of Student user accounts on Sing Up.

Student users receive access to resources via the Student Area under [student.singup.org](https://student.singup.org/) and cannot access resources on [www.singup.org](https://www.singup.org/). Student users inherit the Membership status as well as Membership benefits from their parent Membership account. There are no restrictions on the number of Student user accounts that can be created under a Membership account.  
 

### [7\. Membership Account Management and Use](https://www.singup.org/terms-and-conditions)

**7.1. Single-user Membership account.** The Sing Up user owning the single-user Membership account is the account administrator and is responsible for

i. providing true, accurate, current, and complete information about the single-user Membership account as prompted by the registration form(s) ("Account Data");  
ii. maintaining and promptly updating the Account Data to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

It is against the Terms to use a single-user Membership in a school or any organisational setting if the Sing Up user owning the single-user Membership account is employed by a school as a full-time or part-time permanent member of staff. It is against the Terms to allow anyone else other than the account owner access to the single-user Membership account and Membership benefits.

The single-user Membership account holder is responsible for any activity occurring on their Membership account, whether authorised or not, and agrees to

iii. immediately notify Sing Up of any unauthorised access to the Membership account or any other breach of security;  
iv. defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sing Up from any loss or damage arising from unauthorised use of your Account Data.

**7.2. Multi-user Membership account.** A multi-user Membership account is managed by at least one Membership Administrator. Any Sing Up user attached to a multi-user Membership account can become a Membership Administrator

i. on activation of the Membership if this Sing Up user placed the Membership order; or  
ii. by another Membership Administrator setting them as a Membership Administrator (subject to 6.4.).

There are no restrictions on the number of Sing Up users that can be given Membership Administrator rights, but it is good practice to keep the number of Membership Administrators to a minimum. Every Membership Administrator is responsible for

iii. providing true, accurate, current, and complete information about the multi-user Membership account as prompted by the registration form(s) ("Account Data");  
iv. maintaining and promptly updating the Account Data to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete;  
v. adding and approving additional Sing Up users to the multi-user Membership account;  
vi. removing any Sing Up user not actively employed by the school or organisation owning the Membership;  
vii. managing administrator privileges of Sing Up users attached to the Membership account, such as assigning or removing Membership Administrator or Students & Groups Manager privileges.

It is against the Terms to share the multi-user Membership account across more than one school or organisation (including other organisations across a hub), except as expressly authorised by Sing Up. It is against the Terms to allow access to the multi-user Membership account to any Sing Up user not actively employed by the school or organisation owning the Membership.

Each Sing Up user with access to the multi-user Membership account is responsible for any activity occurring on this Membership account, whether authorised or not, and agrees to

vii. immediately notify Sing Up of any unauthorised access to the Membership account or any other breach of security;  
viii. defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sing Up from any loss or damage arising from unauthorised use of your Account Data.  
 

### [8\. Membership Period and Fees](https://www.singup.org/terms-and-conditions)

**8.3. Membership fees and Top-Up product fees.** Membership prices and Top-Up product prices will be as quoted on the Site, except in the case of obvious error. 

Prices displayed will be in pounds sterling and net of VAT unless otherwise stated. VAT will be added at the standard UK rate according to current national and international VAT laws for trading UK products nationally and internationally.

Where, within this 14-day period, you used the service or digital content, you may still have the right to cancel, however Sing Up will refund any monies paid minus the proportionate cost of the service you have already received.

**9.2. Cancellation of physical goods.** Under the UK Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 you have the right to cancel the contract for purchase of physical goods within 14 days from the day you received the goods.

Physical goods returned to Sing Up should be clearly marked as "Contract Cancellation" and must include all relevant documentation. Sing Up advise

iv. using a recorded delivery method for the return of goods, for your protection.  
v. packaging the items securely, as returned goods that are damaged will not qualify for refund. 

A refund will be given for the value of the goods supplied only. You are responsible for the cost of the original despatch and the return of the goods. A refund is subject to the goods reaching Sing Up within 14 calendar days of the date on which you received them.

**9.3. Reporting of faulty goods.** Where services or goods supplied by Sing Up are deemed to be faulty, Sing Up will provide either a replacement or a full refund. You can report faulty services or goods by contacting Sing Up via

**9.4. Termination of Sing Up user account. By you.** In accordance with our [Privacy Notice](https://www.singup.org/privacy-policy "Opens internal link in current window"), requests to terminate a Sing Up user account may be made any time. To terminate a Sing Up user account, the account holder should contact Sing Up via the [contact form](https://www.singup.org/contact-us "Opens internal link in current window"). 

Sing Up will permanently terminate a Sing Up user account and remove user data to the extent permissible by applicable law. If a Sing Up user requesting termination has access to a single-user Membership account, the single-user Membership account will be terminated at the same time. If a Sing Up user requesting termination has access to a multi-user Membership account, the Sing Up user account will be removed from the Membership account during the termination process.

Where the right to cancel a contract is exercised (subject to 9.1. and 9.2.), this does not terminate the Sing Up user account. It is responsibility of the Sing Up user account holder to request with Sing Up the termination of the Sing Up user account.

**9.5. Termination of Sing Up user account. By Sing Up.** In accordance with our [Privacy Notice](https://www.singup.org/privacy-policy) and best practice with regards to data protection laws, Sing Up will terminate a Sing Up user account after inactivity of two years or longer. A Sing Up user account termination actions the permanent deletion of user data to the extent permissible by applicable law. A notification as well as reminders will be sent via email to the registered email address, asking the Sing Up user account owner to login to their Sing Up user account in order to keep access to the Sing Up user account and avoid its termination.

If a Sing Up user account scheduled for termination has access to a single-user Membership account, the single-user Membership account will be terminated at the same time. If a Sing Up user account scheduled for termination has access to a multi-user Membership account, the Sing Up user account will be removed from the multi-user Membership account during the termination process.

**9.6. Termination of Student user account. By you.** Student user accounts are the sole responsibility of and are managed solely by the Membership account and can be terminated at any time by that Membership account.

**9.7. Termination of Student user account. By Sing Up.** In accordance with our [Privacy Notice](https://www.singup.org/privacy-policy) and best practice with regards to data protection laws, Sing Up will terminate all Student user accounts created by a Membership account, when a Membership account has been expired for 6 months or longer. A Student user account termination actions the permanent deletion of user data to the extent permissible by applicable law. A notification as well as reminders will be sent via email to Membership Administrators, reminding to renew Sing Up Membership for their Membership account in order to avoid the termination of Student user accounts. The Membership account needs to have active Membership to avoid termination.

**9.8. Violation of Terms.** In its sole discretion, without liability to you or any third party, and with or without notice, Sing Up reserves the right to 

i. suspend or terminate your Sing Up user account and the Membership account you access on a temporary or permanent basis,  
ii. suspend or terminate any of your passwords or accounts (or any part(s) thereof or related files and information),  
iii. remove and discard any of your content,

if Sing Up believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. Any suspected abuse of the Site, the Services, and benefits given with Membership or without, will be followed up. In the event where a breach of the Terms is confirmed, Sing Up reserve the right to terminate Membership without refund of monies paid.

The responses described in this paragraph are not limited, and Sing Up may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate in connection with any breach of these Terms, and Sing Up may use whatever information that is available about you to stop any further infringements. This may include disclosing any relevant information to the relevant law enforcement authorities.

**9.7. Disputes.** In the event of any disputes arising, Sing Up will endeavour to provide analytical information on your usage for purposes of clarification, but has no liability to do so. Sing Up will not be held responsible for any disputes that arise as a result of usage by users who have been authorised to access the Site and Services via a Membership account.  
 

### [10\. Sing Up Songs and Resources](https://www.singup.org/terms-and-conditions)

**10.1.**  **Access to songs and resources.** Sing Up users will have access to high quality songs and resources via the Site and the Song Bank. All songs and resources made available are subject to the Sing Up account type (subject to 6.2. to 6.4.), as well as copyright and license restrictions.

Songs and resources will normally need to be unlocked by the use of the allowance (subject to 11.1. to 11.6.), except if free access is provided. Free access to songs and resources may be time limited and Sing Up reserve the right to change, amend, or withdraw access to free songs and resources. Once unlocked, songs and resources, except for song sheets, are available without time limitation as long as active Membership is held. Song sheets are available for a period of 12 weeks uninterrupted, as long as active Membership is held. Song sheets can be re-unlocked after the 12 weeks have passed.

**10.2.  Playlists.** Playlists created by a Sing Up user belong to that Sing Up user and are not transferable. When a Sing Up user has access to a Membership account (subject to 6.3. and 6.4.), and until this user is removed from the Membership account, this user’s playlists will be shared with any Sing Up user attached to the Membership account.

**10.3.  Trial account.** With a trial account (subject to 6.2.), access to a limited number of selected trial resources is available, which can be downloaded, viewed, and streamed for free, subject to copyright and license restrictions.

Songs and resources accessed as part of a trial account are for the sole use of the individual owning the trial account.
