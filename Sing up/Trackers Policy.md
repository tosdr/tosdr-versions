Cookie Policy
=============

Our website uses cookies and other related technologies (for convenience all technologies are referred to as “cookies”). In the content below, we inform you about the use of cookies on our website.

### [What is a cookie?](https://www.singup.org/cookie-policy)

Cookies are pieces of data, normally stored in text files, that websites place on visitors’ computers to store a range of information, usually specific to that visitor – or rather the device they are using to view the site – like the browser or mobile phone.

Cookies allow you to login on one page, then move around to other pages and stay logged in. They allow you to set preferences for the display of a page, and for these to be remembered the next time you return to it.

Cookies can also be used to watch the pages you visit between sites, which allows advertisers to build up a picture of your interests. Then when you land on a site that shows one of their adverts – they can tailor it to those interests. This is known as ‘behavioural advertising’.

Almost all websites use cookies in some way or another, and every page you visit in those sites writes cookies to your computer and receives them back from it. Cookies are incredibly useful – they allow modern websites to work the way people have come to expect – with every increasing level of personalisation and rich interactive functionality.

Cookies are categorised depending on what function they are set to perform:

#### Necessary cookies

Some cookies ensure that certain parts of the website work properly and that you can access the service you require and that your user preferences remain known. By placing these cookies, we make it easier for you to visit our website. This way, you do not need to repeatedly enter the same information when visiting our website and, for example, when you use an ecommerce site, the items remain in your shopping cart until you have paid. We may place these necessary cookies without your consent.

#### Analytical cookies

Analytical cookies are used to assist us optimize the website experience for users. With these analytical cookies we get insights in the usage of our website. We must ask your permission to place analytical cookies.

#### Advertising cookies

Advertising cookies enable us to personalise the advertisements for you, and we (and third parties) gain insights into the campaign results. With these cookies you, as website visitor, are linked to a unique ID, so you do not see the same ad more than once for example. Because these cookies are marked as tracking cookies, we must ask your permission to place these.

#### Functional cookies

Functional cookies allow websites to remember users preferences, such as language, region, username etc.

#### Social media buttons

Buttons such as for Facebook and Instagram are sometimes used to promote webpages (e.g. “like”, “pin”) or share (e.g. “tweet”) on social networks like Facebook and Instagram. These buttons work using pieces of code coming from Facebook and Instagram themselves. This code places cookies. These social media buttons also can store and process certain information, so a personalised advertisement can be shown to you.

Please read the privacy statement of these social networks (which can change regularly) to read what they do with your (personal) data which they process using these cookies. The data that is retrieved is anonymised as much as possible.

There are other technologies used such as scripts. A script is a piece of program code that is used to make our website function properly and interactively. This code is executed on our server or on your device. A web beacon (or a pixel tag) is a small, invisible piece of text or image on a website that is used to monitor traffic on a website. To do this, various data about you is stored using web beacons. Tracking technologies are also used by some cookies to provide analytical data and reAdvertising. You can control tracking cookies through your browser settings.

When you visit our website for the first time, we will show you a pop-up with an explanation about cookies. As soon as you click on “Accept all cookies”, you consent to us using all cookies and plug-ins as described below in this cookie policy.
