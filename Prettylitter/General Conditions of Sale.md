Refund & Cancel Policy
======================

**Refund Policy**
-----------------

PrettyLitter is an advanced, innovative litter designed to help monitor your cat’s health. It requires the careful reading of instructions and correct usage in order to be effective.  
  
PrettyLitter will not refund orders based on incorrect usage of the product or a cat not acclimating to a new litter. Most cats will accept a new litter outright, however, some may require a transition period through the mixing of old and new litter.
