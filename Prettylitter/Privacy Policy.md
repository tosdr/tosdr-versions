Anything you post online is public information. We are not responsible for anything you voluntarily post online. Users should use caution when disclosing Personal Data online. 

**Assignment**

We may share or transfer your Personal Data in the course of any direct or indirect reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, bankruptcies, and sales of all or part of our assets.  Your Personal Data may be shared following the completion of such transaction and/or during the assessment processing pending transfer (subject to confidentiality requirements).  If transferred, your Personal Data will remain subject to this Privacy Statement or a policy that, at a minimum, protects your privacy to an equal degree as this Privacy Statement unless you otherwise consent. 

**How do we safeguard your Personal Data?** 

We maintain (and require our service providers to maintain) appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect the security of your Personal Data. Please understand, however, that no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure due to the inherent risks of data transmission. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any data you transmit to us, and you understand that any data that you transfer to us is done at your own risk. We recommend that you also take additional measures to protect your Personal Data. For example, install up-to-date anti-virus software, close browsers after use, keep confidential your login credentials and passwords, and regularly update software and apps to ensure you have the latest security features. 

If we learn of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Sites or providing Personal Data to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the Sites. We may post a notice via our Sites if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions on the security measures we use, you may contact us using the contact information provided at the top of this Privacy Statement. 

**International Transfer of Personal Data** 

If you choose to provide us with Personal Data, we may transfer that Personal Data to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, in accordance with local law. We may also transfer your Personal Data across borders, from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions in accordance with legal requirements. Mars primarily uses European Union Commission Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers from the European Union, the EEA, and Switzerland where required by law. Where necessary, Mars uses the UK International Data Transfer Agreement for data transfers from the UK. For transfers between other jurisdictions, Mars may rely on other legal mechanisms for international transfer, as appropriate under the relevant law.
