SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT EXCLUDED UNDER THESE TERMS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES AND INVESTORS WILL NOT EXCEED USD$100.

**Indemnification**

You will defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from and against any actual or threatened suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), claims, damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, penalties, interest, and disbursements) arising from or related to your conduct with respect to the Service or violation (or alleged violation) of these Terms or the rights of any third party by you.

**Suspension and Termination**

The Company may suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Service for any reason or for no reason at all and with or without notice at the Company’s discretion. All of the terms of these Terms (excluding the license grant) will survive any termination or suspension.

**Governing Law; Arbitration**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE COMPANY.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without resort to any conflict of law provisions.

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Service, you and the Company agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Los Angeles, California. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and the Company are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and the Company will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Los Angeles, California. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.

For any disputes that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms or the use or the Service.

**General**

Enforcement of these Terms is solely at the Company’s discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. The section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.

These Terms (and the other policies and terms referred to above) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service, and they supersede any prior agreements that may have been made.

PrettyLitter Referral Offer Terms
---------------------------------

EFFECTIVE DATE: Sep 1, 2024

Thank you for participating in PrettyLitter’s Offer Referral Program (the “Program)! The Program allows users (the “Advocates”) to share an offer (“Offer”) by using a personalized link that Advocates share with their friends (the “Friends”). Subject to these Offer Terms, and as described below, Advocates and Friends will be able to obtain an online coupon code (“Reward”) that they can redeem with PrettyLitter.

By participating in the Program, you, as an Advocate or Friend, as the case may be (collectively, “You”), agree to enter into these Offer Terms with PrettyLitter.

Subject to these Offer Terms and any other terms described in the offer page, the personalized links that Advocates share with their Friends will allow their Friends to obtain Rewards that ​they can redeem when making their first purchase order with PrettyLitter (a “Qualifying Purchase”). A Qualifying Purchase may be subject to a minimum spend. When a Friend uses an active personalized link to make their Qualifying Purchase with PrettyLitter, the Advocate who referred that Friend will earn their own Reward that the Advocate can use for future purchases with PrettyLitter or, if applicable, at third-party retailers. To qualify for a Reward, the Friend must be a new customer to PrettyLitter the Advocate must be a PrettyLitter customer for more than two (2) months. Rewards will be automatically applied to the next monthly subscription as a credit to the subscription order in the amount of the cost of one bag of litter. Rewards will be applied after the completion of a Qualifying Purchase and after approval by PrettyLitter, in its sole discretion. Advocates may not earn more than one (1) Reward in 30 days or more than five (5) Rewards in total. Advocates may earn only one (1) Reward per Friend, regardless of the number of purchases that his or her Friends make. Rewards cannot be combined with other discount codes in a single order. To receive multiple Rewards, Advocates must introduce multiple Friends who make a Qualifying Purchase using the Advocate’s active personalized referral link. An Advocate cannot refer themself to earn a Reward. In addition, the Referred Customer and the Referrer cannot be the same person (for example, by using a different email address). When sharing Rewards, Advocates must tell their Friends that Advocates will receive a reward from PrettyLitter if they make their Qualifying Purchase using your personalized link. PrettyLitter, in its sole discretion, may impose limits on how many Offers may be shared by an Advocate, as well as how frequently those Offers can be made, and Rewards may not be given if those limits are exceeded.

PrettyLitter reserves the right to refuse to issue or redeem a Reward to Advocates or Friends at any time. Further, PrettyLitter reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) vary any and all elements of an Offer at any time without notice to You and (ii) to prevent any individual from participating in this or future promotions. An Offer cannot be applied to previous purchases and is not redeemable for cash. You understand that although You initially participated in an Offer as a Friend, You will be considered an Advocate if You share a personalized link with your own Friends.
