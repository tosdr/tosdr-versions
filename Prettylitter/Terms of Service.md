**Limitation of Liability**

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROPERTY, PHYSICAL LOSSES, DEATH OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE SERVICE, AND/OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES OR MATERIALS, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY) AND EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT EXCLUDED UNDER THESE TERMS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES AND INVESTORS WILL NOT EXCEED USD$100.

**Indemnification**

You will defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from and against any actual or threatened suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), claims, damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, penalties, interest, and disbursements) arising from or related to your conduct with respect to the Service or violation (or alleged violation) of these Terms or the rights of any third party by you.

**Changes to the Service**

The Company reserves the right in our discretion to review, improve, change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service and/or any features, information, materials or content on the Service with or without providing notice to you.

**Consent to Electronic Communications**

To withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please notify us at [meow@prettylitter.com](mailto:meow@prettylitter.com)

**Suspension and Termination**

The Company may suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Service for any reason or for no reason at all and with or without notice at the Company’s discretion. All of the terms of these Terms (excluding the license grant) will survive any termination or suspension.

**Governing Law; Arbitration**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE COMPANY.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without resort to any conflict of law provisions.

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Service, you and the Company agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in Los Angeles, California. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and the Company are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and the Company will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in Los Angeles, California. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.

For any disputes that are not handled by arbitration, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms or the use or the Service.

**General**

Enforcement of these Terms is solely at the Company’s discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. The section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.

These Terms (and the other policies and terms referred to above) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service, and they supersede any prior agreements that may have been made.

**Contact Us**

**Notice for California Users**

If you are a California resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the  address above with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Website users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N.
