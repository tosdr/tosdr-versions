We are a United States corporation registered in the State of Delaware and located in Atlanta, Georgia.

* Name
* Gender
* Postal address
* Telephone number
* Email address
* Driver License or Permit (e.g. vehicle, pilot, water sports, etc)
* Driving Record
* Background check
* Criminal history

* Other data about you that is requested by a Relying Party or that you authorize us to process

How We Collect Personal Data
----------------------------

We collect Personal Data in a variety of ways as described below.

### **Information Obtained Directly From You**

To use our Services, we require you to register by providing your name and contact information. You may, but are not required to, provide additional information, such as the data listed in the Collection of Personal Data section above. Note that this is not an exhaustive list.

We may ask you to provide Personal Data for various reasons. For example, when you request a demo of our platform, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, geographic and job information.

We may ask you for similar information at other times, such as when you apply for a job through our Sites or contact our customer service team.

You may also provide us your Personal Data when you sign up for a webinar, download a whitepaper directly on our Sites or from one of our partners, or complete a contact us form on our Sites.

We also collect Personal Data that employees, contractors, or agents of our Relying Parties provide to us when they register for access to the Evident platform. The information we may collect includes name, address, company name, location, email address, phone number and account password.

### **Information Uploaded to the Services**

We invite you to post content or upload information and materials to the Sites or Services, including pictures, documents, records and any other materials that you would like to be available to Relying Parties through the Services. In some cases, we may ask you to submit a visually scanned or photographed image of your face and/or your identification card, driver’s license, passport, utility bill, bank account statement, insurance card, or credit/debit card. This image may include your photograph and other information from the imaged document, such as your eye color, weight, height, and organ donor status. If you post content or upload information or materials to our Site or Services, we may use this content to provide the Services to you, and we may share this content, after receiving your consent, with a Relying Party or other third party for the purposes authorized in your consent, such as for verification purposes. If you consent to sharing your materials with a Relying Party or other third party, the Relying Party’s privacy policy and other agreements with you will govern how your materials are used.

### **Information Obtained From Third Party Sources**

Through our Sites and Services, we may receive information, including, with your consent where required, from third party providers and sources that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify an individual, including you. For example, a Relying Party using our Services may provide us with your name and contact information so you can join our Services or qualify to use the Relying Party’s products or services. We verify the information we receive about you so that the Relying Party can have confidence in the accuracy of the information. To do so, we may collect information about you from publicly-available information and third party sources. For example, if a Relying Party requires you to carry insurance, we may verify with your insurance provider that your coverage is in effect, or we may verify that you have a valid driver license or permit.

We also collect, with your consent where required and in accordance with applicable laws, consumer reports about you, such as credit reports or background checks, if the Relying Party requires such information.

We do not control the privacy practices of these third parties that we collect information from. In some cases, such as when a Relying Party asks us to obtain a credit report on you, it may be the Relying Party’s legal obligation to obtain your consent. In those cases, we are relying on the Relying Party’s authorization to collect this information from or about you.

We also may receive your Personal Data such as name, business email, company and job title, from trade shows or other similar events that we sponsor or from third parties that provide such information. We use this information to send marketing messages to you as described below.

### **Information Collected Automatically**

We automatically collect information about your use of our Sites and Services, including through cookies, web beacons, and other data collection technologies designed for use with websites, internet services or mobile devices or apps that you use. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you. If you can be identified from this information, for example by combination with other pieces of information, then we will treat this information as Personal Data. Please see the information below to learn more about how we use cookies and other data collection technologies, and how you can control such uses.

This information can include your browser type and operating system, your IP address, the length and times of day you use our Sites or Services, the referring URL or webpage that led you to our Sites or Services.

Additionally, when you use our App, we may collect information on your mobile device, such as device name and model, mobile operating system type, name and version; language information; and activities within the Services.

With your permission, we will collect location information from your mobile device to help us verify information you may have provided to us. You may turn off this feature through the location settings on your mobile device. More information about how to do this and manage other mobile privacy settings is available from your device provider.

### **Information Obtained From Social Networking Sites**

You may log into our Sites or Services through your social networking accounts, including Facebook and Google. If you do this, we obtain information from these sites as follows:

* Google. If you log into our Services using your Google account, you must enter your Google email address and password. We will collect your email address, profile information and photo if you login to our Services using Google.
* Facebook. If you log into our Services using Facebook, you must enter your Facebook email address or phone number, and password. We will ask that you grant us permission to access and collect your Facebook public profile information (this includes your name, profile picture, and any other information you have set to public on your Facebook account) and email address.

We securely store the information that we receive from Facebook and Google with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.

Any third-party social networking site controls the information it collects from you. For information about how they may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult their respective privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party social networking site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.

Our Sites and Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Evident (“**Third Party Sites**”).

Please contact the operators of Third Party Sites directly for information on their privacy practices and policies.

Security
--------

Evident is built to protect your private information and to allow you to securely share your information with Relying Parties. We have implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we protect the Personal Data that you submit to us through encryption and access controls.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

Use of Cookies and Other Data Technologies
------------------------------------------

We may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our site) or similar digital technologies to record log data. Many browsers default to accepting cookies. You may be able to change this setting in your browser and you can also clear your cookies. If you do, you may lose some functionality of our Sites or Services.

We may use the following types of cookies and digital technologies:

* [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac)

Note, however, that if you reject our request to use cookies or turn cookies off, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Sites or Services and you may not be able to benefit from the full functionality of the Sites or Services.

To find out more about cookies and similar technologies, including how to see what cookies and similar technologies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/), and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) online resources at youradchoices.com/control, and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/), and follow the opt-out instructions there, or if located in the European Union, visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (EDAA) Your Online Choices opt-out tool at [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page, the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, or the EDAA Your Online Choices opt-out page will opt you out from the delivery of interest-based content or ads to you by the third parties participating in those opt-out services, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any personalized advertising through our Services or on our Sites or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, non-personalized advertisements or advertisements based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI or EDAA websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available at these websites.

**Third Party Analytics**
-------------------------

We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites and our Services including, to the extent permitted, our App. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Sites and Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Sites and Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. Read more about how Google uses your personal information [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) and opt-out of Google Analytics [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Third Party Advertisers**
---------------------------

We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to personalize advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including Pixel Tags or clear GIFs), and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.

**Modifying Personal Data**
---------------------------

You may modify Personal Data that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Services for a period of time and in accordance with our data retention policies.

Do Not Track Signals
--------------------

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” (“**DNT**”) option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications that you do not wish such operators to track some of your online activities over time and across different websites and platforms. There is no universally agreed-upon standard for what an organization should do when it detects a DNT signal. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms. Learn more about Do Not Track [here](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

**Opting out of email**
-----------------------

We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.

**EU Data Subjects**
====================

This section applies if you are an EU data subject (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway and, where applicable, Switzerland). Evident is the data controller for processing Personal Data provided to Evident in relation to the Sites. Unless you have given us your consent for our independent uses of your Personal Data or we have another lawful basis for processing your Personal Data, we act strictly as a data processor for Personal Data that we process through the Services, as described under the “Information Collected Through our Services” section above. For example, we process data on behalf of Relying Parties in relation to transactions you may be conducting or considering with them. We rely on the following legal bases for processing your Personal Data:

* Processing of your Personal Data based on your consent for such processing, which may be given either to us or the Relying Party, such as facial images or other biometric data when we use them to verify or authenticate your identity.
* Processing of your Personal Data that you provide to us (such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, company name and role) when you request a demo of the Evident platform or when you otherwise send inquiries about our Services is necessary to respond to or implement your request prior to entering into a contract with us or a data controller that is using our Services.
* When you apply for employment, including through our Sites, processing of your contact details and data about your employment history and education (as needed to evaluate your job application, to conduct job interviews, and as is otherwise needed for recruitment) is necessary to respond to your request to process your application for employment. If you do not provide this data, we will not be able to process the application that you submit.
* We use account-related data to set up accounts for users in the Services and to administer and support those accounts (such as usernames, email address and billing information), provide you with access to the Services, contact you regarding your use of the Services or to notify you of important changes to the Services. Such use is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and the Relying Parties or us.
* We may send you information by email or through other electronic communications on our new products or services or other promotions if you consent to receiving them. If you have not opted-in to these marketing emails, we do this either because we are relying on an exception to opt-in requirements or because of our legitimate interest to promote the success of our business.
* Our use of data relating to your use of the Sites and/or the Services, described above, is necessary for our legitimate interests in understanding how the Sites and the Services are being used by you, to improve your experience on it and our Service offerings.
* We also have a legitimate interest in aggregating and/or anonymizing or de-identifying the information that we collect through our Sites and/or the Services and using this information for our business purposes, as described above.
* When we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you, and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you, unless we have your consent for our processing activities or those activities are otherwise required or permitted by law. You have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests, as further described below.
* With respect to biometric data, such as facial images, that you may provide to verify your identity to a Relying Party, the purpose of processing is to allow you to grant your informed consent relating to the use of biometric data to the Relying Party in connection with Evident’s performance of the Services, and also as required under the laws applicable the Relying Party and Evident concerning data subjects. In any cases where we process biometric data without your explicit consent, we do so on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR, specifically for: (i) the prevailing legitimate interest of Evident to comply with its legal obligations in jurisdictions outside of the European Union; and (ii) the prevailing legitimate interest of data subjects using our Services to be notified of biometric information processing by Evident as a processor acting on behalf of Relying Parties, and to express their consent for such processing under the laws applicable to Evident concerning the data subject (e.g. the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act or “**BIPA**”).

Subject to applicable law and reasonable steps that we may take to verify your identity with respect to your requests, you have the following rights in relation to your Personal Data:

* Right of access: If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Data and, if so, provide you with a copy of that Personal Data (along with certain other details). If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.
* Right to rectification: If your Personal Data that we control is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to have it rectified or completed. Note that we may not be able to rectify data obtained from a third party such as a governmental agency or other data that we do not control, and you will need to contact that third party directly. If we have shared your Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the rectification where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.
* Right to erasure: You may ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data and we will do so in some circumstances, such as where we no longer need it (we may not delete your data when other interests outweigh your right to deletion, for example if we are required by law to keep it). If we have shared your data with others, we will tell them about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.
* Right to restrict processing: You may ask us to restrict or ‘block’ the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of that Personal Data or object to us processing it. We will tell you before we lift any restriction on processing. If we have shared your Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the restriction where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.
* Right to data portability: You have the right to obtain your Personal Data from us that you consented to give us or that is necessary to perform a contract with you, to the extent it is available. We will give you your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
* Right to object: You may ask us at any time to stop processing your Personal Data, and we will do so if we are processing your Personal Data for the Services, for direct marketing, or otherwise. However, if we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your Personal Data and we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing we may continue; or you may exercise your rights by contacting us as indicated under “Contact Us”. Note you will be asked to verify your identity when submitting a request.
* Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling: You have the right to be free from decisions that we make based solely on automated processing of your Personal Data, including profiling, which produce a significant legal effect on you, unless such profiling is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us, or with your explicit consent.  
    Right to withdraw consent: If we rely on your consent to process your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Your withdrawal of consent will not apply to or affect prior processing of data that was processed prior to our receipt of your withdrawal of consent.
* Right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority: If you have a concern about our privacy practices, including the way we have handled your Personal Data, you can report it to the data protection authority that is authorized to hear those concerns.

EU Data Subjects may contact us about these rights at [compliance@evidentid.com](mailto:compliance@evidentid.com) or at the address set out in the Contact Us section below.

Retention
---------

Evident will retain Personal Data for the period necessary to provide our Services or for the purposes it was collected for, as otherwise required by our contracts or by law.

When determining how long we should keep data, we consider the length of time we will have a relationship with you or the Related Parties and provide our Services, whether there is a legal obligation that would require us to keep the information for a specified period of time, the reasons why we process your data, the risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data.

We may also anonymize or de-identify Personal Data so it would no longer be associated with you for research or analytical purposes. If data is anonymized or de-identified, we may use this data for as long as we have a legitimate business purpose for such use, without additional notice to you.

Children Under 13
-----------------

Our Services and Sites are not directed at children under 13 years of age (or older where required by law), and we do not knowingly collect or receive Personal Data from them. If we learn that we have received Personal Data from a child whose age requires parental consent for processing, we will delete the data. If you believe that we have received Personal Data from a child whose age requires parental consent, you may contact us at [compliance@evidentid.com](mailto:compliance@evidentid.com).

**Disclosures of Personal Information for Monetary or Other Valuable Consideration or for Business Purposes**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We don’t sell consumers’ personal information in the sense that most people think of selling, but we do provide it to other companies that you should expect to interact with, such as a Relying Party, and those companies we have contracted with to help provide some part of our services, like marketing services providers and sponsors of events. The term, “sale,” is broadly defined in CCPA and includes any sharing of your personal information to a third party for consideration if the third party might use the information for their own purpose (such as in advertising or analytics). 

As is common practice among businesses that operate websites, we may have disclosed certain online identifiers, information about the use of our Sites and inferences drawn about you to our social media, advertising and analytics partners for our marketing and related purposes. While we do not view these data sharing activities as “sales,” if you wish to opt-out of our uses of personal information for these purposes, click here Cookie Settings. We don’t intend for our Services to be used by anyone under 16 and therefore do not knowingly collect, sell or share personal information of individuals under age 16.

We have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business purposes in the last twelve (12) months:

| **Category of Personal Information** | **Recipient Categories** | **Business Purpose for Disclosure** |

**Your California Privacy Rights**
----------------------------------

If you are a California resident, you have the following rights. We will honor requests received to the extent required by applicable law and within the time provided by law.

### **Right to Access and Information Regarding Personal Information**

You have the right to request that we disclose to you the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. Specifically, you have the right to request that we disclose the following to you, in each case in the twelve-month period preceding your request:

* The categories of personal information we have collected about you;
* The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information;
* The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information;
* The specific pieces of information we have collected about you;
* The categories of personal information about you, if any, that we have disclosed for monetary or other valuable consideration and the categories of third parties to which we have disclosed the information, by category or categories of personal information for each third party to which we disclosed the personal information; and
* The categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose.

We will deliver personal information that we are required by law to disclose to you in the manner required by law within 45 days after receipt of a verifiable request, unless we notify you that we require additional time to respond, in which case we will respond within such additional period of time required by law. We may deliver the personal information to you through your account, if you maintain an account with us, or electronically or by mail at your option. If electronically, then we will deliver the information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information from one entity to another without hindrance.

### **Right to Deletion of Personal Information**

You have the right to request that we delete personal information about you that we have collected from you.

### **Right to Correct Personal Information**

You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate information that we maintain about you.

### **Right to Opt Out**

You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information. We do not sell personal information, but we recognize that some privacy laws define “personal information” in such a way that making available identifiers linked to you for a benefit may be considered a “sale.” To opt-out of this, please click onCookie Settings.

### **Right to Limit the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information** 

You have the right to limit that use or disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services. Evident only collects Sensitive Personal Information such as social security and drivers license numbers with your informed consent and as necessary to perform our Services. We do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for any other reasons such as inferring consumer characteristics about you.

### **Right to No Discrimination**

We may not discriminate against you because of your exercise of any of the foregoing rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, including by:

* Denying you goods or services;
* Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
* Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
* Suggesting that you will receive different price or rate for goods or service or at a different level or quality of goods or services.

We may however, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by your personal information.

**Requests to Exercise Your Rights**
------------------------------------

If you are a California resident, you may request to exercise the foregoing rights by:

* Submitting a request to Compliance@evidentid.com
* Calling us at 877-832-5298

----------------------------------------------

If you are a California resident, you may ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or affiliates for those third parties or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes and identify the name and address of the third parties that received such personal information. We don’t share this information with others for their direct marketing purposes.

Illinois Privacy Rights
-----------------------

Additional Notice for Illinois Residents – This part of our Privacy Policy applies to residents of Illinois. We have provided this additional notice to ensure we give Illinois residents the disclosures that are required by Illinois laws, (e.g. the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act or “**BIPA**”).

Evident’s collection of personal information may include biometric identifiers and/or biometric information (collectively “**biometric data**”), and with your consent, we may share such biometric data with Relying Parties for their use as provided by their privacy policies and any agreements they may have with you. We may collect, process and store your biometric data for the purpose of verification services and long-term proof of inspection of your provided form of identification, on behalf of and as instructed by the Relying Parties. We will store your biometric data for as long as the Relying Party requests (e.g., the duration of your use of its services), but in any case no longer than the earlier of the date when (i) the Relying Party ceases to have a relationship with Evident; (ii) within three (3) years after your last interaction with our Services has occurred; or (iii) you request your Personal Data to be deleted (unless we are required by law to retain any elements of your Personal Data).

Facial images. Specifically with respect to facial images, if you agree to use our facial recognition service that we offer to Relying Parties, we will collect an image of your face that you provide through a web or mobile app (i.e. a selfie) and a photo or scan of your face as it appears on an identification document, such as a driver license. We will use facial recognition technology only for the purpose of verifying your identity as the person who appears on the identification document. We may share the facial scans and related biometric data with the Relying Party through which you used our identity verification service. In general (but subject to the retention periods for biometric data described above), we will retain your facial recognition information, including the photo of your face and photo or scan of your identification document, for the amount of time needed to fulfil the Relying Party’s requirements and applicable audit and verification purposes. In no event will Evident store your facial recognition information after Evident ceases to have a customer relationship with such Relying Party.

Your Privacy Rights under Other US State Laws
---------------------------------------------

Based on the applicable law in the state where you live, you may have the following rights with respect to your Personal Information:

* Not to discriminate against you because you have exercised any of these rights, including by:
    * denying you Services;
    * charging different prices or rates for our Services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;

To exercise any of these rights, you may make a request to confirm, access, correct, delete, obtain a copy, or opt-out of the processing of your personal data for targeting advertising, sale, or profiling by Cookie Settings using this webform or contacting us using the information in the [Contact Us](#_Contact_Us) section below.

For emails, please include “Privacy Rights” as the subject line. You must include your full name, email address, and attest to the fact that you are a resident. We will process your request within 45 days or let you know if we need additional time or cannot process your request.

If we are unable to honor your request for any reason, we will notify you of the reason within the request time period.

**Right to Opt Out**
--------------------

You may have the right to opt out of the sale of their Personal Information and targeted advertising. To exercise your right, please click on this link  
Cookie Settings on the bottom of the webpage where your information is being collected.

**Opt-Out Preference Signals**
------------------------------

Some browsers and browser extensions support opt-out preference signals such as the Global Privacy Control (“**GPC**”) that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating your choice to opt-out from certain types of data processing, including data sales. GPC is a web browser-level setting, maintained by either a browser or a browser extension, that a user or privacy-focused technology can set. In certain regions, when we detect such a signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices as required by applicable law.

**Appeals of Our Decisions**
----------------------------

In some jurisdictions, you may appeal to us if we refuse to take action on your exercise of certain choices described above. In order to appeal such a refusal, please contact us using the information in the Contact Us section below with the subject line “Appeal of Refusal to Take Action on Privacy Request” and provide the relevant information in the email. 

If we decline to take action on any request you make, we will provide you with the information required by the applicable law where you live. This may include an explanation of why we declined your request, information on how to appeal our decision, and/or how to make a complaint to your state Attorney General.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post all changes to this Privacy Policy on this page and will indicate at the top of the page the modified policy’s effective date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this page on an ongoing basis so that you are aware of our current privacy policy. If required by the applicable law, we will notify you of the changes.
