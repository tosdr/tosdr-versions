2. [Terms And Condtions](https://www.ashleyfurniture.com/terms-and-conditions)

Terms and Conditions
====================

These Terms and Conditions govern all purchases made through the Ashley.com website and the Ashley mobile app (collectively, the “Site”). As used in these Terms and Conditions, “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to Ashley Global Retail, LLC. By using the Site to purchase products and services, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.

THESE TERMS INCLUDE A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER THAT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS. PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER SECTION BELOW.

Order Notification and Charges
------------------------------

Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We will notify you after we have confirmed your order and after it is shipped. You’ll receive notification immediately after the order is confirmed and when it ships.

If you used a credit card as your payment method, we’ll authorize the credit card for the full amount at checkout, including taxes. We only charge your credit card when the order ships (Standard Shipping) or after it’s been delivered (No-Hassle Delivery + Assembly or Doorstep Delivery).

Pricing
-------

Advertised pricing and promotions are available online only. In-store pricing and promotions do not apply to online pricing.

Sales Tax
---------

All merchandise purchases are subject to sales tax in accordance with the current state and local tax rates for the shipping/delivery destination. Estimated sales tax is calculated at the time of purchase and is generally based on the total selling price of each item, which, depending on local and state laws, may include discounts and shipping and processing charges.  To the extent any of the factors affecting the calculation of sales tax change between the time you place an order and the time your credit card is charged, the amount appearing on your order as estimated sales tax may differ from the sales taxes ultimately charged.

Delivery Methods
----------------

The size and weight of your online purchase are factors that help determine the most efficient delivery method.

### Standard Shipping

We ship smaller, lighter items via courier or mail (e.g., UPS or Fed Ex). Items may require assembly. You’ll receive notification as soon as the order ships. Available shipping options will be noted in the shopping cart, but generally include 1-day and 2-day shipping. If 1-day shipping is available for an order, the order is expected to be delivered within 1 business day after it has been shipped and picked up by the delivery carrier. If 2-day shipping is available for an order, the order is expected to be delivered within 2 business days after it has been shipped and picked up by the delivery carrier. We encourage you to review the shipping fees listed in the shopping cart prior to submitting your order.

### No-Hassle Delivery + Assembly  

If you select No-Hassle Delivery + Assembly, your items will be delivered, set in your room of choice and, if necessary, assembled. Packing materials will be removed. The delivery team will not move or take away existing furniture or furnishings. To prepare for your delivery, please check out our  [pre-delivery tips](https://www.ashleyfurniture.com/beforedeliverytips/before-delivery-tips.html) . You will be contacted within two days of placing your order to schedule delivery.

No-Hassle Delivery + Assembly fees are established by the team delivering your order and may vary market to market. We encourage you to review the delivery fees listed in the shopping cart prior to submitting your order. Note: Additional fees may apply for delivery above or below the ground floor, or for other unusual circumstances.

Please arrange for an adult to be present when the truck arrives. An individual 18 years of age or older must be present to accept and sign, which acknowledges you received the items, inspected them, and found them in good condition. Delivery personnel will not carry furniture up more than 3 flights of stairs. If you need to reschedule the date, contact the delivery provider as soon as possible at the phone number listed in your order confirmation. We request 48-hours’ notice if you want to reschedule or cancel delivery. You may incur an additional fee if you reschedule less than 48 hours prior to delivery or if no one is home when the delivery team arrives. If delivery does not take place within 30 days of the original scheduled delivery date, the order may be treated as a canceled order.

### Doorstep Delivery

If you select Doorstep Delivery, your items will be delivered in their original packaging to your doorstep. For apartment or condominium delivery, items will either be placed outside your unit, in the building’s lobby, or at the property’s office. An individual 18 years of age or older must be present to accept and sign, which acknowledges you received the items, inspected them, and found them in good condition. This service does not include assembly, setup, or removal of packing materials. Delivery personnel will not carry furniture up more than 3 flights of stairs.

Please be aware that it is your responsibility to bring the furniture inside from the drop off area. You will also be responsible for furniture assembly, furniture set up, unboxing and removal of all packaging materials. Any damage that results from moving the furniture into the home or assembling the furniture will also be your responsibility. Doorstep Delivery may not be available for all items or purchases.

### Merchandise Pickup

Merchandise Pickup is available at participating locations only. If you select Merchandise Pickup, your items will be made available for pickup by you at one of our locations or warehouses. We may assist you in loading your items, but it is your responsibility to ensure items are properly loaded and secured. If your items are not available at the time of sale, we will notify you when they are ready for pick-up. At pickup, you will sign an acknowledgment that you received the items, inspected them, and found them to be in good condition.

Change or Cancellation
----------------------

To change or cancel an order, please follow the instructions below:

* For **Standard Shipping** , please call Customer Care at 866-436-3393. You will receive an email confirmation regarding your change or cancellation. If the product has already shipped, you may return it under our Return Policy **(please note return shipping fees may apply)** .

* For **No-Hassle Delivery + Assembly** and **Doorstep Delivery** orders, you can cancel the order by calling Customer Care at 866-436-3393. If you cancel your order at least 48 hours before the scheduled delivery time, we will simply cancel your order. If you cancel your order less than 48 hours prior to the delivery date, we will cancel the order but will charge your credit card the delivery fees. You will receive an email confirming cancellation of your order.

You may not cancel special orders or orders for monogrammed or personalized items.

Please contact the store where you made the purchase. The store’s phone number is located on your receipt or on our  [store locator](https://stores.ashleyfurniture.com/ "https://stores.ashleyfurniture.com/") .
