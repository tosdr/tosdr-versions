Data We Control and Store

FASTPOTATO PTE. LTD. is the Data Controller of the personal data you offer to us.

How long we store your data

You can always request a deletion of your data on your personal information. Your **usage data** will only be stored for no more than 48 hours, after which it will be automatically deleted.

Again, our guiding principle towards data collection is to collect only the minimal data to maintain VPN service. Therefore, we delete your personal data as soon as it is unnecessary to store.

Where We Store Your Data

When you use our Service, you may be using servers located in a variety of different countries. However, there is a difference between use and storage. The data we collect are mostly stored in servers located in the European Union.

Since we are a Singapore company, we may access the data outside from the EU when necessary, for example, when user support is required.  
In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We always strive to protect your data to the maximum extent we can.

Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data

We rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal data.

Please note that since we do not collect your IP address and the servers you connected to, we are unable to disclose such data under any circumstances.

Mergers, acquisitions and corporate restructurings

We may share some or all of your personal data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership. If we are involved in such a case, we'll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give affected users notice before personal data is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
