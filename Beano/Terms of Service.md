Terms and Conditions
====================

Kids!
-----

These rules are boring. That’s why they’re for grown ups. The rules tell grown ups how you can get the best out of the Beano site. Please show these rules to your parent or guardian before you use the Beano site. That way, everyone’s happy to create mayhem!

Adults
------

These rules are for you adults. It’s a bit dull but very important. We call these our “Terms of Use” or “terms”. Still with us? Not nodded off yet? Good!

The Terms of Use explain how the Beano website and apps should be used. They also set out your – and our – rights and responsibilities. Please read these terms before you allow your child to use Beano. You should explain to your child how these terms will work when they visit the site.

We cannot promise that the Site will always work or that it won’t have errors in it. Access to the Site is allowed on a temporary basis and we may have to remove, change or stop the service we provide on the Site without telling you. We will not be liable to you or any third party if the Site is not available or if we change, stop or remove the Site, or any features, parts or content of the Site, at any time no matter for how long.

We may, from time to time, restrict access to certain features, parts of or content on the Site, or even the entire Site. We may restrict this everyone, or just specific people/devices. We may also refuse access if we believe the terms of use have not been followed

Please tell us if you suspect there may have been a security breach by contacting us using the contact details at the bottom of these terms.

### What you are allowed to do

The Site is only for personal use. As long as users follow the “what you are not allowed to do” section below, users may use, share and display content from the Site on a computer screen, print and copy individual pages and store such pages on their device.

Additional terms may also apply to certain features, parts or content of the Site and, where they apply, will be shown to users before they access the relevant features, parts or content.

### What you are not allowed to do

Again, this Site is only for personal use. It is not for business or commercial use, apart from our handpicked, kid-friendly advertisers who we allow to display their advertisements on the Site. This means that you/your child cannot use the Site to make a profit, for example:

Except where the Site or these terms of use clearly say they allow this, you/your child must not:

* use the Site other than to browse it and where the Site permits this, to upload content;
* collect or gather from the Site information that identifies someone else;
* remove or change any legal notices or other content of the Site or try to get around security or get in the way of the proper working of the Site or the servers on which it is hosted;
* use the Site to send any unwanted or unauthorised advertising or spam mail;
* use the Site to deliberately send or upload any data or material that contains anything which harms computer software or hardware, including viruses, trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code;
* attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Site, the server on which the Site is stored or any server, computer or database connected to our Site or get around, put out of action or otherwise get in the way of our security-related features;

* change, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Site or parts of the Site or create new works from using materials from the Site;
* use the Site for any business, commercial or public purpose.

You and your child must only use the Site and anything available from the Site for lawful purposes (complying with all applicable laws and regulations), in a responsible manner, and not in a way that might damage our name or reputation or that of any of our group companies and affiliates.

All rights granted to you under these terms of use will end straight away if you or your child are in breach of any of the terms of use and you must at, at our option, return or destroy any copies of the materials you have made in breach of these terms.

### Our Content

#### Ownership and Use

You agree that we are the owner or licensee (meaning someone else who owns but we are using it) of all intellectual property rights in the Site and any content on the Site (including text, graphics, software, photographs and other images, videos, sound, trade marks and logos) (let’s call this Our Content).

We need to be careful how Our Content is used. This means that (unless specifically allowed on the Site or in these Terms) you/your child must not:

* copy Our Content without our permission;
* change in any way the paper or digital copies of Our Content which been printed off or downloaded from the Site
* use any illustrations, photographs, video or audio files or any graphics in Our Content separately from any text that goes with it.

We do encourage our users to share Our Content, using the features on the Site. If you/your child shares, prints off, copies or stores Our Content you and your child must make sure that any legal notices (like copyright, trade mark or other author or owner “credits”) from the original version of Our Content are still included on any material shared, printed out or stored by you or your child.

Nothing in these terms of use gives you/your child any rights in respect of Our Content and you agree that you/your child do not have any ownership rights in the Site or Our Content.

#### Quality

Whilst we try to make sure that all information contained on the Site (other than any information that our users upload to the Site themselves) is true, you should not rely on such information. You should check with the relevant person giving you the information before acting on any such information.

We do not promise the truth, completeness, correctness, reliability, integrity, quality or originality of any content of the Site or that the Site will do what you want it to and, to the extent we are legally allowed to, we exclude all other terms which are not written down or referred to in these terms of use.

### User content

The Site may, from time to time, allow users (such as, your child) to comment on Our Content or send us materials (such as videos, photographs or text), for the purpose of us publishing this on the Site and making it available to other Site users (let’s call this User Content). For example, we may invite users to “finish the picture” using one of our online drawing tools or we may invite users to send us a photograph of something they have created by following the instructions on the Site.

#### Safety

We know how important it is to make sure nothing unsuitable ends up on a kids site. So we control the User Content which ends up posted on the Site to be seen by all our other users. This is how we do this:

Whenever User Content is sent or uploaded to us on the Site, we will moderate/check the User Content (including any text or other information sent to us with the User Content) before we publish it on the Site.

We may use third parties, such as a moderation agency, to help us moderate User Content, so we will need to send all pre-moderated User Content to them (we will make sure this is done safely, see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.beano.com/privacy-policy) for more information).

We will decide whether to publish any User Content or not. However we will not publish any User Content that contains any information which in any way identifies a child under the age of 13 (however we may “blur out” children’s faces to keep them anonymous).

We, and any third parties we use to help us moderate, will delete (and not use) any User Content which does not pass our moderation process.

We handle any complaints or Site deletion requests seriously. If you need to complain or make a deletion request please [contact us here](https://www.beano.com/contact-us).

Please note that after User Content is published it will be available to all visitors to the Site or (if we use the User Content elsewhere – see Ownership and Use below) our other customers or users.

#### Ownership and Use

**If you do not agree to this section, please do not send, or allow your child to send, us any User Content.**

It is up to us to decide whether or not we use moderated User Content.

By giving us User Content, we and our group companies and our affiliated companies and third party service providers have certain rights to do what we want with moderated User Content.

This includes your, and your child’s permission to use, copy, adapt, edit, translate, make available and transmit or otherwise communicate, display and publish such moderated User Content (or any part of it) and to create any new works from it together with the ability to allow other people to do the same whether we refer to your or your child’s name or not. To the extent we are legally able to, you and your child waive your ‘moral rights’ (i.e. the right to be identified as the author or to object to critical treatment) in moderated User Content. The grant of these rights to us cannot be taken back, lasts forever, applies anywhere in the world and we do not have to pay you or your child any money for it.

This means that we can (without telling you or your child):

* continue to publish, use and display moderated User Content even if you or your child ask us to remove it and/or after your use of the Site has ended;
* repost User Content on our social media accounts;
* remove moderated User Content at any time
* use all or part of moderated User Content in advertising and marketing materials for our products;
* change moderated User Content, which may mean that moderated User Content does not refer to you/your child.

One example is we may publish a moderated Finish the Picture submission in the Beano comic.

User Content should be original to you or your child and must not infringe anyone else’s intellectual property rights or their privacy or be defamatory or abusive.

User Content is the view of the person who made it and does not contain our views.

You are responsible for your/your child’s User Content and you are responsible for and agree to pay us any losses, costs or expenses that we suffer as a result of you failing to comply with any of these terms.

### Third Party Content

The Site contains content (including text, graphics, software, photographs and other images, videos, sound, trade marks and logos) from third parties (Third Party Content). We do not monitor or check Third Party Content for accuracy or completeness. We are not responsible for the content or performance of any Third Party Content posted on, available through or installed from the Site, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices of or contained in the Third Party Content. If you or your child decide to leave the Site and access or use Third Party Content, you do so at your own risk. Third parties might collect and use information about you and your child in a different way to us, so please make sure that you read the privacy policy for their Third Party Content.

The fact that we include links to such Third Party Content does not mean any approval or endorsement of or association with their operators.

### External links and banners

The Site may, from time to time, include links to third party sites and banner advertising, which may or may not be obvious. We have included links to these sites to provide access to information and services that users may find useful or interesting but we do not accept responsibility for their content nor for their compliance with any laws and regulations.

We accept no responsibility for these sites or any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. The fact that we include links to such sites does not mean any approval or endorsement of or association with their operators.

### Liability

Nothing in these terms will limit or exclude our liability to you or your child for: 1) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; or 2) if we misrepresent things to you fraudulently or 3) for anything else that we have to be liable for under English law.

To the extent legally possible:

We will not compensate you/your child (nor shall we be responsible to you/your child) for loss of anticipated savings, data, wasted time, losses that are not directly caused by us or for any loss of profit, revenue, contracts, reputation or other similar losses whether directly or indirectly incurred.

We are not responsible for any dealings you have with third parties that take place using our Site unless specifically agreed elsewhere in our terms.

We are not liable or responsible for links to other sites and resources which take you out or off the Site.

We are not responsible for any loss or damage which happens as a result of you or anyone else using the Site or relying on any of the Site.

We are not responsible for any changes made to the content of the Site by other people we have not asked to change the Site.

We cannot and do not promise that any content of the Site will be free from viruses and/or other code that may have contaminating or destructive elements and cannot accept any responsibility for the same. It is your responsibility to have the correct security (including anti-virus and other security checks) to satisfy your particular requirements around safety and reliability of content. Any software is downloaded at your own risk.

You agree that we are not responsible for your use of the Site. You are responsible for any losses, costs or expenses that we suffer as a result of you/your child failing to comply with these terms of use.

### General

If any part or provision of these terms of use is found to be unenforceable or invalid for any reasons, this shall not affect the validity of any other part or provision.

You may not give, allow others to use or otherwise transfer any of your rights under these terms of use. We may give, allow others to use or transfer these terms of use or our rights under them without your consent or telling you.

These terms of use replace any previous versions.

English law is the only law that applies to these terms and you agree that any dispute between us regarding them or the Site will only be dealt with by the English courts. Nothing shall prevent us from bringing proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights before any court that can hear the dispute.

Competition Terms
-----------------

These terms and conditions (“Terms”) are in addition to and should be read together with any specific entry instructions or terms applying to the specific competition (“Competition Information”) and in the event of inconsistency these Terms shall prevail.

To enter a competition all entrants must comply with the entry requirements set out in the Competition Information and these Terms. The entrant acknowledges that failure to comply with the Competition Information or these Terms may result in his/her disqualification from the competition.

BEANO reserves the right to amend and update these Terms at their sole discretion from time to time and such changes will become effective as soon as they are published on the relevant site/publication.

In these Terms “Editor” shall mean the editor(s), including online editor(s) of anything published by BEANO and “Marketing Manager” shall mean the head of marketing for BEANO from time to time.

### Promoter Details

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Competition Information these Terms apply to all competitions aimed at those aged 18 or under run by Beano Studios Limited (a company registered in England with company no. 10054526) whose registered address is at 185 Fleet Street, London, United Kingdom, EC4A 2HS (BEANO) and/ or any group companies wholly or partially owned by BEANO.

### Eligibility

Employees and members of their immediate families (being spouses, parents, children and siblings) of a) BEANO; or b) any company or sponsor associated with BEANO, may not enter the competition. Any such person attempting to enter shall not be eligible to win and their entry shall not be counted.

Unless otherwise stated in the Competition Information, the competition is open to all individuals under 18 years old who are residents of the United Kingdom. Further restrictions for certain competitions regarding age and residence may be specified in the Competition Information and shall take precedence over these Terms.

Entrants must have the consent of a parent or guardian over 18 to enter the competition. BEANO reserves the right to obtain proof of such consent and to refuse entry or to choose another winner if such proof, where requested, has not been given.

BEANO has the right at any time to require entrants to provide proof of identity as evidence of eligibility to participate. If an entrant fails to comply with a request for proof of identity, or provides false or misleading information, the Editor or Marketing Manager may at his/her discretion, disqualify the entrant from the competition, or, where appropriate allocate the prize to another eligible entrant. Such decision will be final and no correspondence will be entered into about a decision regarding eligibility.

### Entry

Unless otherwise stated, entrants may make as many entries to a competition as they wish. Entries must be submitted in accordance with the format specified in the Competition Information. Proof of making a phone call, sending an e-mail or posting is not proof of our receipt of an entry and BEANO accepts no responsibility for lost, delayed or damaged entries or entries that are not received for any reason. Where postal entries are permitted only original entry forms may be used and only those carrying correct postage will be accepted.

The competition is free to enter and (unless otherwise stated in the Competition Information) no purchase is necessary. However standard charges of entry (including postage charges and standard telephone/SMS/text message network rates) may be incurred and all entrants must ask permission from the bill payer before entering. BEANO is not liable for any associated cost to entrants or their parents and/or guardians of entering a competition unless expressly specified in the Competition Information.

Entrants (including the Winner) hereby assign all intellectual property rights (if any) and waive all moral rights in their entry to BEANO. BEANO is unable to return any entries submitted unless expressly agreed otherwise. Where materials are returned to the entrant BEANO accepts no responsibility for the safe return of any material or its return in an undamaged condition or any liability for loss or damage to such material.

BEANO accepts no responsibility for entries that are delayed or which are not received for any reason and also has no liability in respect of any incomplete entries that are received. Incomplete entries will not be counted and will be discarded. BEANO has no responsibility to inform any entrant that their entry is incomplete and not valid for entry to the competition.

By entering the competition entrants warrant that all information they submit is correct and not obscene or offensive or otherwise in breach of any third party rights and BEANO reserves the right to verify the eligibility of all entrants. BEANO reserves the right to disqualify any entrant from the competition if it believes (in its sole discretion) that such entrant has breached any of these Terms.

The closing date for entries will be specified in the Competition Information (and may be extended at the absolute discretion of BEANO) and winners will be notified within 28 days of the closing date (or such other date specified in the Competition Information). Any late entries will not be accepted but the participant may still incur any associated costs.

### Prize

The prizes offered in competitions may be provided by a sponsor (or alternative promoter) rather than BEANO and in such circumstances BEANO does not accept any responsibility for the accuracy of any prize descriptions supplied by such third parties.

A third party providing the prize in a competition may impose terms and conditions upon the use or the acceptance of the prize. The winner shall be advised of these terms and conditions prior to their acceptance of the prize.

Prizes are subject to availability. No cash alternative is available. BEANO and/or, (if applicable) the competition sponsor, reserve the right to offer an alternative prize of equal or greater value than that advertised. The prizes are not transferrable and non-negotiable.

Unless stated otherwise in the Competition Information BEANO accepts no responsibility for any costs or expenses incurred by the winner, their guests, or parents/guardians in connection with claiming any prize won in the competition (including travel to and from any event). The parents/guardians of the prize winners are responsible for paying all taxes, duties and any other levies on prize winnings if applicable.

### Selection of winner

For competitions, entries will be judged by a panel of judges and an independent judge, unless subject to a public vote. For prize draws, the winner(s) will be selected at random by the Editor/Marketing Manager. In the event that a competition has generated insufficient correct entries, BEANO reserves the right to distribute the rest of the prizes to incorrect entries based on a draw. The judge/Editor/Marketing Manager’s decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into.

Unless expressed otherwise in the Competition Information, if, for any reason, BEANO is unable to contact a winner or the winner’s parent/guardian to inform them that they have won a competition, or if a winner or their parent/guardian does not contact BEANO within a reasonable period of BEANO sending notification to such winner to confirm acceptance of a prize, then BEANO reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to select an alternative winner.

The judges’ decision is final and binding in all matters regarding the competition (including in the event of a dispute) and BEANO will not enter into any correspondence or discussion with entrants.

BEANO may pass details of winners and their parents/guardians to a third party who is engaged to deliver prizes to winners on behalf of BEANO or (as the case may be) a sponsor or alternative promoter.

Names of winners and results of competitions may be published by BEANO in our relevant publications and/or on our relevant online channels. To obtain the name(s) of the winner(s) of a specific competition, please send a stamped addressed envelope to:- Marketing Manager, Beano Studios Limited, 185 Fleet Street, London, United Kingdom, EC4A 2HS, after the relevant closing date. Please indicate on the envelope the name, publication and date of the specific competition. For phone/text entries please mark the envelope for the attention of the “Enterprise department”.

### General

To the extent permissible under applicable law, BEANO shall not be liable to any entrant or to the winner (and/or any guest or parent/guardian as applicable) for any loss or damage howsoever caused (whether in contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence) statutory duty or otherwise) arising out of or in connection with the competition.

To the fullest extent permitted by law BEANO does not make any express or implied warranties, representations or endorsements whatsoever with regard to the competition prizes or any information, service or product provided in connection with a competition.

Entrants (including the winner) shall not do anything that could damage or harm the reputation of BEANO, any of their magazines or publications, or any products included as part of the competition prize.

The competition is governed by English law and any disputes arising in connection with the competition and/or these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England.

### Use of Data

Entrants and their parents/guardians agree that (if they win) they may be asked take part in such reasonable competition-related publicity as BEANO may require and accept that BEANO may publicise their entry, including photos or images submitted as part of their entry, names, likeness and statements in connection with/resulting from the competition in any and all media. Unless stated otherwise in the Competition Information, no entrants, winners, their guests or parents/guardians shall be obliged to take part in any photo publicity and parent/guardian consent shall be obtained by BEANO prior to undertaking any photo publicity. Entrants shall not enter into any correspondence or give interviews with any third party on any matters arising from the competition, without the prior written permission of BEANO.

BEANO and/or third party promoters for the competition may use data supplied by entrants to process the competition, inform winning participants of their winning entry, distribute prizes and, where the relevant marketing permissions have been collected, to contact entrants in relation to other competitions it runs or to market products or services it believes may be of interest to them.

Entry into this Competition shall constitute consent to the uses of data contained in these Terms.

If, at any time, entrants no longer wish to be contacted by BEANO, they should contact BEANO in accordance with our privacy policy. BEANO will always use and keep personal data in accordance with its [Privacy Policy](https://www.beano.com/privacy-policy). This outlines the basis on which BEANO will process any personal data it collects from entrants or that entrants provide to BEANO. Please read this carefully and if entrants or their parents/guardians have any questions, or would like to request a paper copy of the policy to be sent to them, contact BEANO at [\[email protected\]](https://www.beano.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

These terms and conditions (“Terms”) describe the terms and conditions under which Beano Studios Limited (“Beano”) may use content created and publicly posted by you, as more specifically identified in the Beano communication to you (“Beano Post”) via the social media platform on which the Beano Post appears (the “User Generated Content”).

Please read these terms of use carefully before you post any User Generated Content. By posting User Generated Content in response to Beano’s Post, you agree that you accept these terms and that you agree that they apply to you.

These Terms are supplemental to and should be read in conjunction with any specific instructions or terms applying to the Beano Post and in the event of inconsistency these Terms shall prevail.

### Ownership and Use of User Generated Content

**If you do not agree to this section, please do not send us any User Generated Content.**

By giving us User Generated Content, we and our group companies and our affiliated companies and third party service providers have certain rights to do what we want with it.

This includes your permission to use, copy, adapt, edit, translate, make available and transmit or otherwise communicate, display and publish such moderated User Generated Content (or any part of it) and to create any new works from it together with the ability to allow other people to do the same whether we refer to your name or not. To the extent we are legally able to, you waive your ‘moral rights’ (i.e. the right to be identified as the author or to object to critical treatment) in moderated User Generated Content.

The grant of these rights to us cannot be taken back, lasts forever, applies anywhere in the world and we do not have to pay you any money for it.

This means that we can (without telling you):

* continue to publish, use and display moderated User Generated Content even if you ask us to remove it and/or after your use of the Site has ended;
* repost User Generated Content on our social media accounts;
* remove moderated User Generated Content at any time
* use all or part of moderated User Generated Content in advertising and marketing materials for our products;
* change moderated User Generated Content.
