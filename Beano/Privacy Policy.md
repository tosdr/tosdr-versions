www.Beano.com is owned and operated by Beano Studios Limited, and we promise to use our best efforts to keep any details you give us private and secure, and we promise not to collect any personal information on you when you use this website. Our website is for children. Our shop is for adults and parents. When you fill out a ‘contact us’ form to ask us questions it creates an email to the Beano – which means we have your email and name, so we can reply to you BUT once we’ve replied we always make sure to delete your email and name.

We do collect website ‘cookies’ (not actual cookies; we eat those) as they help us understand how you found our website, and what pages you like. We use this information to make the website brilliant for you, and because we always want to make it better and better we use a programme called Google Analytics to understand how people interact with the website. For example, if we notice lots of people watching particular kinds of videos we know to try to make more of those kinds of videos. If we notice people are not watching particular types of videos, we’ll make less of those kinds of videos.

There are data-protection laws that make sure we do everything right, this is called the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 and the Data Protection Act 2018, and we are registered on the Data Protection Public Register (as number ZA206818). Our Data and Analytics Lead will be happy to deal with any questions you have. They can be contacted via our contact us page or by post to Data and Analytics Lead, Beano Studios Limited, 185 Fleet Street, London, EC4A 2HS.

The rest of this page is for grown-ups. It tells grown-ups what information about you or your grown up we collect through Beano.com, and how we use this information. Please show this page to your parent or guardian before you use the Beano Site.

Grown Ups
---------

### 1\. About Us

This website (www.Beano.com) is owned and operated by Beano Studios Limited (a limited company registered in England with company number 10054526 with its registered office at 185 Fleet Street, London, EC4A 2HS).

Beano Studios is committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the security of any personal information received from you. We strictly adhere to the requirements of the data protection legislation in the UK, including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 and the Data Protection Act 2018 and we are registered on the Data Protection Public Register number ZA206818.

### 2\. The Data Protection Officer (DPO)

Due to the type of data we collect and the nature of our business we currently have no legal requirement to have a DPO at Beano Studios. However, our Data and Analytics Lead will be happy to deal with any queries or requests regarding the data we hold about you. They can be contacted via our [contact us page](https://www.beano.com/contact-us), by phone on +44 20 7400 1094 or by post to Data and Analytics Lead, Beano Studios Limited, 185 Fleet Street, London, EC4A 2HS.

### 3\. Information we collect about You and How we use it

We do not require your or your child’s personal information to use the Site.

We do not collect sensitive information (also known as special categories of information) about anyone using the site except when you specifically knowingly provide it and have consented to this.

The “[contact us](https://www.beano.com/contact-us)” function generates an email to us and gives you/your child the option to give your/their email address. This means we will collect the email address and name associated with the chosen email address, which we commit to delete once we have processed the request or query.

We will also collect any personal information volunteered to us when we are contacted, this will also be deleted once we have processed the request or query.

Competition entries are submitted via email. This means we collect an email address in order to contact the winner and request a parent/guardian email address to request consent from them to send the prize to the winner. Once the competition has concluded all emails and the parent/guardian data will be deleted.

We do collect some information from cookies and similar software which allows us to understand how you arrive on our websites and use and navigate round it. This information is used to help us improve the site. We also store some usage information in Google Analytics.

### 4\. Cookies \[and web browser information\]

This website uses cookies. For more information about what cookies are, what we use them for and how you can delete them, please read our [cookie policy](https://www.beano.com/cookie-policy). Currently we do not have the ability to react to do not track being set in the browser.

### 5\. What we do with your Information

We will use your personal information for several purposes including:

* To provide personalised communications
* We may use your or your child’s personal information to respond to a query or report by email. We, and any external moderation company, will delete any content submitted which does not comply with our moderation process (for example, content which includes personal information).
* We will delete your or your child’s email address and other personal information from our records once we have responded to their query, report or submission.
* We will retain an adult’s personal data for the purposes that personal information was provided to us and delete those records once the purpose is achieved. For example, if a query is submitted to us via the [contact us page](https://www.beano.com/contact-us), we will retain the name and email address of the submitter whilst we respond to that query. Once the submitter is satisfied with the response we will delete their data from our systems. This is also applicable for competition winners where we will retain a parent/guardian email and postal address in order to send prizes to winners. This data will be deleted from our systems once receipt of the prize is confirmed.
* IP addresses and device identifiers are processed by Google Analytics to enable us to anonymously identify the location of users & establish the number of visits from different countries. More information about the process can be found on [Google Analytics’ helpsite](https://www.beano.com/external-link-warning?verify=62e7826335&to=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fanalytics%2F). Beano Studios does not view or store IP addresses and this information is not used for the purposes of identifying individuals.
* For analysis and research to improve our services
* We may use, share and disclose information in aggregate (so no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.

### 6\. What if I don’t provide some or all of the information requested?

The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold but the main impacts may be:

* We may not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have
* We cannot personalise the service you receive
* We will not be able to limit the volume of advertisements you see.

### 7\. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?

There are a number of grounds we process your data under. These are;

* Legal – should we be legally required to contact you concerning a product e.g. a product recall
* Legitimate interest – this means the processing is in Beano Studios’ interest. It allows us to improve the services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which are popular with which groups of individuals
* Consent – where you have given us consent to process your data.

### 8\. Will You be contacted for Marketing Purposes?

We use your personal information to update you about new services by post, email and SMS text message. We will only contact you with your consent. Consent notifications will be clearly displayed at the point of collection of personal information.

We may personalise the message content based on information you provide us with, and your use of Beano Studios websites.

Children will not be contacted for marketing purposes unless we have obtained the correct level of parent consent to do so.

We may display advertisements served by ourselves. These contextual advertisements would be placed without any Personal Information collected, including persistent identifiers.

### 10\. Competitions

In the event of an online competition all email addresses will be deleted once each contest closes.

In order to run our online competitions, we ask for the entrant to send in their answers to [\[email protected\]](https://www.beano.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with no other personal information. If the entrant has been selected as a winner, we will contact the winner(s) asking for a parent or guardian email address. Once the entrant has given this, we will then contact the parent or guardian to confirm their consent to sending the prize and to confirm delivery details.

### 11\. Totally Random Questions

We occasionally ask our Users questions to gauge their opinions on relevant topics. These questions are called ‘Totally Random Questions(TRQs)’ and are seen randomly by Users within quizzes on our quiz pages.

All information gathered from ‘TRQs’ is anonymous and stored as aggregated data. No personal data is collected or stored in this process and the data collected is not used to profile or target a child as it cannot be linked to an individual. Aggregated and anonymised data may be shared with 3rd parties.

The questions asked via ‘TRQs’ may sometimes be sponsored by 3rd parties so they can better understand the opinions of our audience at an aggregate and anonymised data level. When a TRQ is sponsored it will be very clearly marked as so and all questions are audited and approved by Beano Studios insight professionals before publication. Use of the website does not require any User to respond to TRQ questions and they are completely optional to answer.

In setting TRQs, Beano Studios is seeking to understand the likes, dislikes and trends within its audience base. This is used to inform editorial decisions and to help 3rd party brands improve their propositions. Beano Studios takes data collection and analysis extremely seriously and complies with all relevant GDPR (EU) and COPPA (US) regulations.

### 12\. Internal Sharing

As a Beano enthusiast you may have signed up for a Beano comic subscription for you or your child. The comic is produced by DC Thomson media (our publishing arm) and the website along with other online and offline activities are run by the DC Thomson company known as Beano Studios Ltd. To provide you with a seamless experience it may be necessary to share your personal information between these two organisations. We will only share the information needed to provide you with the services you are using and will not routinely share data we hold about you. We do not build profiles of your or your child’s activities across our company to market to your child.

### 13\. Sharing your Information with Third Parties

We may from time to time provide your or your child’s personal information to third parties for the purposes providing our services. The third-party providers who help us provide our services include service providers who assist us with hosting the Site or our marketing campaigns. They do not decide what is done with your data and only process it on our behalf. These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA); however, we only use providers that provide adequate protection for your information.

When transferring any personal information outside of the EEA we only do so under one of the legally recognised transfer mechanisms for ensuring the data is safeguarded. These are:

* The country in question has been deemed safe for data transfer by the European Commission. Also known as an adequacy finding
* The contract for data processing contains the standard contractual clauses laid down by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer of personal data
* Binding corporate rules – this is where a large company’s own internal processes for international data transfer have been signed-off and agreed by the European Commission as safeguarding the data
* If the data is going to the USA it can be safely transferred to a company that is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield
* Appropriate certification schemes.

We work with the following third-party providers to support the operation of the Site and provide a better experience. These third-party providers do not share children’s personal information with any other providers.

For more information please refer to these third-party providers’ privacy polices as listed below.

We use Launch Darkly to help us test and launch new features on the Beano.com website.

Testing – Launch darkly allows us to try out how well new features are likely to be receivedby presenting them to a limited percentage of website visitors, selected at random, and tracking some anonymous statistics for example: how many visitors interact with the feature, ignore the feature, immediately leave the site.

Launching new features – Launch Darkly allows us to switch on and off website features on different days or weeks, which are waiting in the background, without needing to take the website offline to do so. For example switching on a Christmas feature and then switching it off when Christmas has passed.
