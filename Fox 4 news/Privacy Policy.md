1\. SCOPE AND APPLICATION

Fox Television Stations, LLC ("Company name" or "we"), wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets (collectively, the "Company Services").  California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below.  Consumers in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and states with other similar privacy laws, please see Section 9 below.  By using Company Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies ("Company Affiliates") is available at [www.foxcorporation.com](https://www.foxcorporation.com/).

As set forth in our Terms of Service at [https://www.fox4news.com/terms-of-service](https://www.fox4news.com/terms-of-service), the Company Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Company Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Company Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Company Service.  This Privacy Policy applies to Company’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally Company’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics, and services usage).

2\. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION   
   
Depending on your interactions with us, Company and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you: 

**Registration Information** is the information you submit to register for a Company Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a giveaway.  Registration Information may also include, for example, name, email address, zip code, and phone number. 

**Public Information and Posts** consist of comments or content that you post to the Company Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.   

**Activity Information.**  When you access and interact with the Company Services, Company and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Company Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Company Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.  

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data.  Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).  Company’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Company Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed. 

Other parties that support the Company Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Company Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Company Services or other parties’ services.  Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer.  Company does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled "To deliver relevant advertisements," below.  

Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser. For more information about Google Analytics, please review the site "How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps," located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, please go to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Company Services.

**Information from Other Sources.**  We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Company Affiliates or business partners.  

Depending on your interactions with us, Company may not have collected information from you for each of the categories above.

**‘Do Not Track’.**  At this time we do not respond to the 'Do Not Track' signal, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how the ‘Do Not Track’ signal should be interpreted.

3\. USE AND DISCLOSURE

We may use and disclose some or all of the information we collect from and about you for the following purposes:

**To provide the Company Services.**  We use information we collect from and about you to provide the Company Services. This may include: 

* to measure, maintain and improve those Company Services and features and to develop new products and services, including conducting research and quality and safety assurance measures;

**To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Company Services.**  Information we collect from and about you may be made available to certain service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, and agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the Company Services, and manage and/or provide the Company Services.   

**To deliver video content.**  In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you with other parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the Company Services, including to provide you with access to localized content and video content recommendations.

**To provide co-branded services and features.** We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with other companies ("Co-Branded Services").  These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on Company Services or on that other party’s service.  By virtue of these relationships, we may share information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party.  That other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy. 

**To deliver relevant advertisements.**  Company and our service providers may use information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver and measure relevant, more personalized ads to you when you use the Company Services or another service (on any of your devices).  As noted above, advertising technology companies and advertisers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and information about the different devices and/or browsers you use and your activity on such devices and browsers, to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  To find out more about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see [https://youradchoices.com/](https://youradchoices.com/).  If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit [http://optout.aboutads.info/#/](http://optout.aboutads.info/#/) or [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#) on each of your devices and browsers.  To opt out in mobile apps, you may use your device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization or similar settings or download and use the AppChoices app at [https://youradchoices.com/appchoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). To opt out on connected TVs, please use the setting "opt out of ads personalization,"  "Interest-based Ads," or equivalent settings on your device.  Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop seeing all ads.  

**To contact you.**  Company may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to the Company Services.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  There are certain service notifications and other non-promotional emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the Company Services or policies.  If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.

**To share with our Company Affiliates**.  Company may share information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy with Company Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. A link to a website that lists Company Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy.  Users who visit Company Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. 

**To share with business partners**.  Company may share information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications consistent with your choices. 

**To protect the rights of Company and others.**  There may be instances when Company may use or disclose information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy, including situations where Company has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Company, our Company Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our Terms of Service); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Company Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.

Depending on your interactions with us, Company may not have collected, used, or disclosed information from or about you in each of the categories above, and to the extent that Company has disclosed information from or about you, it may not include all of the information that we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that when the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with other parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

4\. SECURITY

Company uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures designed to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.  However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.

5\. USER ACCESS AND CONTROL

If you are under 18 and a registered user of the Company Services, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Company Services by  contacting us as outlined in Section 7 below.  Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.

You may request that we not share your personal information on a going-forward basis with Company Affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes by contacting us as outlined in Section 7 below. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with applicable law.

6\. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

**Updates to Privacy Policy.**  Company may modify this Privacy Policy.  Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Company Services. 

**Location of Data.**  The Company Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.    

**Linked Services.**  The Company Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.  Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Company Services or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.

Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services.  Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements. 

**Deidentified Information**. To the extent we process "deidentified" personal information, as defined under applicable law, we will maintain and use that information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information except as permitted by applicable law.
