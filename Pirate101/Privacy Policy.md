==========================

The provision of personal data on the internet always carries the risk of unauthorized processing by third parties who gain unauthorized access to this data, as no technological system can be fully protected against external attacks.

We take technical and organizational measures to protect your data from misuse. We process your data in accordance with the requirements of German and European data protection law and continue to further educate ourselves. The data processing is carried out according to the current state of the art.

6\. Origin of Personal Data
===========================

We obtain personal data in the following way:

6.1. Information provided by you
--------------------------------

We receive personal data from you when you provide it in the course of creating an account on the KingsIsle website or using our games and other services. Providing this information is always voluntary. However, some of our services may require certain information from you in order to function properly.

7\. Scope and Purpose of the Processing of Personal Data and the Legal Bases for Processing
===========================================================================================

The scope and purposes of the processing of your personal data will depend on which of our games and other services you use from us, i.e., not every one of our games and other services includes all of the personal data processing practices described herein. In the following, we would like to give you an overview of the personal data that we process in connection with all of our services. Furthermore, we have listed the different categories of data and examples of personal data that can be processed when using the corresponding service.

Personal data is all information about you and your factual and personal circumstances, for example name, address or age. Data that cannot be assigned to a specific natural person is not personal data. For example, this can be statistical data that describes a group.

Regardless of which of our games and other services you use, we will treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations. We will not share it with third parties without your consent, unless permitted by law (e.g., because it is necessary to perform the contract).

In the following you can also read on which legal basis the respective processing of the listed data is based.

The main legal bases in scope are regulated in Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 GDPR. These are, as far as relevant for us, the following cases:

Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR: Data processing is based on a consent that you have granted us.

Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR: The data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or is necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at your request.

Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit c) GDPR: Data processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we are subject.

Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR: The data processing is necessary to protect our legitimate interests or those of a third party, unless your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of personal data, outweigh these.

7.1. Use of our websites

Some of the games and other services allow you to stay up to date using push messages. They inform you about important events or remind you of certain events. The device token allows us to identify the phone based on the app-device combination issued by the providers of push notification gateways. This enables gateway providers to forward messages and ensure that the notification is only sent to devices that have the unique app-device combination.

Examples of processed data: Content of the sent message, date of the sent message, user account, device tokens.

The above processing of personal data only takes place if you have consented to being contacted via push messages. The legal basis is on Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR.

7.3. Transfer to users or the public
------------------------------------

When you use our games or other services, your personal information (e.g. character name, nickname, e.g. in forums) may be visible to other users or the public. This is the case, for example, when you post in our forums, post messages in the public chat of our games, participate in competitions or use leader boards (Competition Boards).

Examples of processed data: Name of the game figure, nickname, e.g. in forums.

The processing of personal data described above is legal under Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR. In addition, the processing is legal as per Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1. lit. f) GDPR, having in mind that our users and we have a legitimate interest in an open exchange between our users about our games and services and other topics.

7.4. Participation in competitions
----------------------------------

We will be hosting competitions at irregular intervals where you can win physical or digital prizes. The task that needs to be accomplished to participate in the respective competition can be found in the announcement of the competition. Depending on the nature of the prize and the required task, different corresponding personal data will be processed to run the competition. The announcement of the respective competition will also include information about what kind of personal data will be used. Please read the announcement of the competition as well as the terms of participation carefully before participating in the competition.

Examples of data processed: E-Mail Address, Address

This processing of personal data is legal according to art. 6, para. 1, sentence 1 b) of the GDPR. In the case that a different legal basis is relevant, this will be stated in the competition announcement.

7.5. Participation in surveys
-----------------------------

You have the opportunity to participate in our surveys. In these surveys, we would like to learn more about how you use our services and our games and how you feel about them. The results of the surveys will be used to improve our services and games.

Examples of data processed: E-Mail Address, your answers

This processing of personal data is legal according to art. 6, para. 1, sentence 1 f) of the GDPR. In the case that a different legal basis is relevant, this will be stated in the respective survey or in the announcement of the respective survey.

7.6. Case records
-----------------

We keep case records for legal disputes with which we are confronted.

Examples of processed data: Name, address, correspondence

The described processing of personal data is lawful according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in protecting and asserting the rights of third parties and our rights.

7.7. Marketing and newsletters
------------------------------

We can inform you by newsletter about similar goods and services according to Sec. 7 para. 3 UWG (German Unfair Competition Act), for example about other games from us. You can unsubscribe from receiving further newsletters at any time free of charge using the link contained in the newsletter (“Unsubscribe button”). In addition, we inform you by newsletter about all offers, services and other activities by us or the other companies in the gamigo group and about all other offers, services and other activities by third parties in connection with the offers, services and other activities of one or more companies in the gamigo group (so-called gamigo group newsletter) if you have previously consented to this newsletter being sent to you. You can also unsubscribe from this newsletter free of charge at any time using the unsubscribe button contained in the newsletter.

Newsletters are sent at our request by our service provider. Your e-mail address, which receives our newsletter, and other personal data are temporarily stored on the service provider’s servers. This information is used to send and evaluate the newsletter. For this purpose, so-called tracking pixels are used, i.e. in our newsletter there is a non-visible image file which transmits technical information to the service provider when the newsletter is opened (e.g. whether the newsletter has been opened). Your data will not be used by the service provider independently to send the newsletter.

We also place banner ads on websites, i.e., we provide our partners with a graphic that they can integrate on their website. The banner contains a hyperlink so that the user can reach one of our websites. In order to enable a statistical evaluation, an ID is generated using a pixel-code to determine how users became aware of our products and, if applicable, whether they have completed a payment transaction.

Examples of processed data: IP addresses, the language used, hardware, how the newsletter was handled, i.e., when it was read, and which links were clicked on.

The described processing of personal data, i.e., the sending of newsletters, has as its basis Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR in conjunction with Sec. 7 para. 3 UWG for the advertising of our own similar goods and services, on the other hand, Art. 6 para. 1 p.1 lit. a) GDPR in connection with Sec. 7 para. 2 no. 3 UWG if you have consented to the gamigo group newsletter being sent to you. We base the use of the pixel-code on Art. 6 Para. 1 S.1. lit. f) GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in customizing our information according to the recipient.

7.8. Media information
----------------------

We collect contact details of journalists in order to provide them with specially prepared information about our services.

Examples of processed data: Name, company, email, phone number.

The above processing of personal data is lawful under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.

7.9. Processing for legal reasons
---------------------------------

We pass on personal data insofar as we are legally obliged to do so. This can happen, for example, as a result of a court or public prosecutor’s order. In doing so, strict attention is paid to ensuring that all statutory requirements are met before passing on the data. In general, only certain data is requested (e.g., technical user data), but in principle the obligation to pass on data may apply to all data collected. Before each transfer of personal data, we critically check whether we are obliged to do so.

We also pass on personal data in the context of legal proceedings (e.g., to external lawyers) if this is necessary to assert our rights (e.g., to protect intellectual property rights).

Examples of processed data: Contact details, user account information.

We will only process personal data for legal reasons as described above if it is compliant with the applicable law. The legal basis is by Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1. lit. c) GDPR for the fulfillment of a legal obligation or under Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1. lit. f) GDPR because we have a legitimate interest in ensuring that our rights are safeguarded or enforced.

8\. Storage Duration and Deletion of the Collected Data
=======================================================

We store personal data only as long as there is a concrete purpose for this. The duration of the storage depends on the purpose of the processing, the requirements of the processing, as well as on your and our interests and rights and, if applicable, the interests and rights of third parties. We always store personal data as briefly as possible (principle of data economy data/minimization), but at the same time we observe the statutory requirements which stipulate a minimum retention period (e.g., in commercial and tax law of up to 10 years, Sec. 257 para. 4 of the German Commercial Code, Sec. 147 para. 3 of the German Fiscal Code).

In any case, the following shall apply: If the purpose of processing has ceased to exist or if data is no longer required to achieve this purpose and there are no further statutory storage obligations to the contrary, we delete the relevant data (e.g., we delete support tickets at the latest 9 months after we have processed your request).

9\. Recipient of Personal Data
==============================

To achieve the processing purposes described above, we pass on personal data to various categories of recipients. The concrete passing on of personal data about you depends largely on which of our services you use.

We share personal data with the following categories of service providers as processors: service providers in the context of fraud and manipulation prevention, , to service providers to conduct surveys, to service providers for analysis services, to payment service providers, to service providers for sending newsletter, to service providers for advertising services, data centers, as well as to subsidiaries and affiliated companies within the meaning of Sec. 15 AktG (German Stock Corporation Act). The transfer of the personal data to the respective recipient as processor is lawful under Art. 28 GDPR.

We pass on personal data to the following categories of service providers as independent controllers: Lawyers, authorities, the police, payment service providers, and providers of “social logins.”
