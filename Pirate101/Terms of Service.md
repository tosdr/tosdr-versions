Without limiting any of the foregoing, you also agree to abide by any code of conduct and policies applicable to the Site or any service available on the Site.  
  
(b) Any content and/or opinions uploaded, expressed or submitted to a message board, blog, chatroom or any other publicly available section of the Site (including password-protected areas), and all articles and responses to questions, other than the content provided by the Company, are solely the opinions and responsibility of the person or entity submitting them and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Company. You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for whatever content you submit, and you, not the Company, have full responsibility for such content, including its legality, reliability and appropriateness. By uploading or otherwise transmitting material to any area of the Site, you warrant that the material is your own or is in the public domain or otherwise free of proprietary or other restrictions and that you have the right to post it to the Site. You grant to the Company the royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, transferable and world-wide right and license to use all content you upload or otherwise transmit to the Site in any manner the Company chooses, including, but not limited, to copying, displaying, performing or publishing it in any format or media whatsoever, modifying it, incorporating it into other material or making a derivative work based on it.  
  
(c) Except as expressly authorized by the Company in writing, you may not reproduce, sublicense, distribute, sell or exploit for any commercial purposes (i) any part of this Site or its content, (ii) access to this Site or (iii) use of this Site or of any services or materials available through this Site, including, without limitation, by leasing access to the Site (e.g., at a cyber café), gathering and selling virtual items, codes, pre-paid game cards, or virtual currency through the Site, or otherwise.  
  
(d) The Company reserves the right, but does not assume any responsibility, to (1) remove any material posted on the Site which the Company, in its sole discretion, deems inconsistent with the foregoing commitments (including any material that the Company has reason to believe constitutes, or for which the Company has received notice of its constituting, a copyright infringement); (2) monitor and/or record communications between and among users on the Site; and (3) terminate any user’s access to all or part of the Site. However, the Company can neither review all material or communication before it is posted on the Site nor ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, the Company assumes no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by third parties. The Company reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary to protect the personal safety of users of this Site and the public; however, the Company has no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this paragraph.  
  
(e) Your failure to comply with the provisions of (a), (b) or (c) above may result in the termination of your access to the Site and may expose you to civil and/or criminal liability.

We may suspend or terminate your account for any failure to comply with these Terms of Use, any terms related to any service offered through the Site or for any reason whatsoever, or for no reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that the Company does not guarantee the accuracy of any information submitted by any user, including account information about the user. You are fully responsible for all activities conducted through your account.

CONTACT REGARDING SUSPECTED INFRINGEMENT  
  
Please contact our designated agent at 972-265-1900 or at [copyright@kingsisle.com](mailto:copyright@kingsisle.com) if you become aware of any content that may infringe the copyright of a third party or that you believe to be in violation of these Terms of Use.  
  
BINDING ARBITRATION; CHOICE OF LAW; CLASS ACTION WAIVER  
  
These Terms of Use shall be governed in all respects by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.  
  
Any dispute that arises out of results from these Terms of Use, the Site or the Services which cannot be promptly resolved by the parties through informal negotiations shall be resolved through binding arbitration as set forth herein. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The parties shall mutually agree upon a single arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the arbitrator within thirty (30) days of one party initiating the arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected by AAA. The place of arbitration shall be Dallas, Texas, USA unless the parties agree (or the arbitrator determines) that the arbitration may be conducted by phone, online, through the exchange of written submissions or some combination of the foregoing. The language of the arbitration shall be English and the arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of Texas, USA. The parties will be entitled to engage in discovery in accordance with the AAA rules. It is the parties’ intent that the discovery proceedings be conducted in a cost-efficient manner and to resolve the arbitration within six (6) months of initiation. Each party will bear its own expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, in connection with resolution of any dispute; provided that each party shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of engaging the arbitrator unless the arbitrator determines that the Company shall pay one hundred percent of the arbitrator fees and costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to seeking arbitration, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief with respect to a breach (or attempted breach) of these Terms of Use with respect to intellectual property or confidentiality.  
  
_PLEASE NOTE: The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis and that these Terms of Use do not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. By agreeing to these Terms of Use, you are subject to binding arbitration and are waiving your right to sue in court and have a jury trial, as well as waiving the option to participate in a “class action” with respect to the Site or services hereunder._  
  
MISCELLANEOUS  
  
The owner of this Site is based in the State of Texas, USA. The Company makes no representation that materials in this Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you access this Site from other locations, you are responsible for complying with local laws.  
  
You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable laws, including export control laws, and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any software or other content downloaded from the Site to a destination prohibited by such laws, without first obtaining, and then complying with, any requisite government authorization. By downloading any software from the Site, you warrant that you are not located in any country, or exporting such software to any person or place, to which the United States has embargoed goods. You further agree not to upload to the Site any data or software that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software.  
  
In the absence of taxes not shown separately, all related taxes, including but not limited to VAT, GST, PST, QST or sales and use tax, are included in the price where applicable.  
  
These Terms of Use, as they may be amended from time to time, completely and exclusively state the agreement between you and the Company with respect to the Site, and no other terms that may have been communicated to you orally or in any other manner shall have any force or effect. Any cause of action you may have with respect to the Site must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action is barred.  
  
You agree and acknowledge that your violation of any restrictions in these Terms of Use on the use of the Site, Site Content, or software or services available on or through the Site, or your use or disclosure of Confidential Information in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of these Terms of Use, may cause the Company irreparable damage for which remedies at law may be inadequate. You agree that, in the event of your unauthorized use of the Site, Site Content, software and services, or your unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief, in addition to such other legal and equitable remedies that may be available. The Company’s licensors and contractors are express third party beneficiaries of any terms in these Terms of Use that are applicable to their products or services, including disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability, and shall have the right to enforce directly against you all of your applicable representations, warranties, covenants, indemnifications and obligations under these Terms of Use.  
  
If any part of these Terms of Use is unenforceable (including, without limitation, any part of the binding arbitration provision above), the unenforceable part shall be construed to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties. The other provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.  
  
The terms related to protection of the Company’s intellectual property rights, disclaimer of warranties limitation of liability, choice of law and binding arbitration, indemnification obligations and any licenses granted by you to the Company shall survive any termination of your Account or these Terms of Use.  
  
The Company’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of the provision. Neither a course of dealing or conduct between you and the Company nor any trade practices shall be deemed to modify these Terms of Use.
