This Agreement contains the terms and conditions that govern your use of any website that displays, links, or refers to this Agreement (such websites referred to herein collectively and individually as “website,” or “this website”).  Affiliates, for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean any parent or subsidiary entities and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control of the entity, where “control” is defined as (a) the ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity or beneficial interests of such entity, (b) the right to vote for or appoint a majority of the board of directors, managers, governors or other governing body of such entity, or (c) the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the entity.

BY ACCESSING, VISITING, BROWSING, USING, OR ATTEMPTING TO INTERACT WITH ANY PART OF THIS WEBSITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WEBSITE’S FORMS, YOU AGREE, ON YOUR OWN BEHALF PERSONALLY, AND ON BEHALF OF ANY ENTITY FOR WHICH YOU ARE AN AGENT OR YOU APPEAR TO REPRESENT, THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.
