This Agreement contains the terms and conditions that govern your use of any website that displays, links, or refers to this Agreement (such websites referred to herein collectively and individually as “website,” or “this website”).  Affiliates, for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean any parent or subsidiary entities and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control of the entity, where “control” is defined as (a) the ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity or beneficial interests of such entity, (b) the right to vote for or appoint a majority of the board of directors, managers, governors or other governing body of such entity, or (c) the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the entity.

BY ACCESSING, VISITING, BROWSING, USING, OR ATTEMPTING TO INTERACT WITH ANY PART OF THIS WEBSITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WEBSITE’S FORMS, YOU AGREE, ON YOUR OWN BEHALF PERSONALLY, AND ON BEHALF OF ANY ENTITY FOR WHICH YOU ARE AN AGENT OR YOU APPEAR TO REPRESENT, THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.

CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS RESERVES THE RIGHT, FROM TIME TO TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, TO MAKE CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT IN CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS’ SOLE DISCRETION.

If any part of this Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable, shall be modified by the court of competent jurisdiction to reflect to the maximum extent possible the original intention of the parties as reflected by the original wording, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

No waiver by Consolidated Communications of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.

No rights, duties, agreements or obligations hereunder, may be assigned or transferred by operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Consolidated Communications.
