This data may also be used to tailor your experience on our sites by providing content that is relevant to your interests and geographic region.

**Information Collected from Other Sources:** To help us better understand and respond to your needs and interests, we may in the future receive information about you from other sources.

**Notice about the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations** **(“GDPR”):** You may have certain rights under the European Union’s GDPR 2016/679.  The GDPR is a complex regulatory scheme and we do not intend to provide every detail here.  If interested you should read the GDPR and the relevant guidance provided by the applicable authorities for a fuller explanation.

The GDPR provides the right, where applicable, to (a) access, (b) publication, (c) erasure, (d) restrict processing, (e) object to processing, (f) data portability, (g) complain to a supervisory authority, and (h) withdraw consent.

Where applicable, the GDPR provides the right to confirm whether Driverge has processed your Personal Data (as defined in the GDPR) and, when Driverge, to access those data, together with certain other information including the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned, and the recipients of the Personal Data.  Where applicable, and providing that we do not affect the rights and freedoms of anyone else, we will supply you with one copy of your Personal Data.  The first copy is free.  We may charge a reasonable fee for additional copies.

Where applicable, the GDPR provides the rights to rectify any inaccurate Personal Data about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to complete any incomplete data about you.

In some circumstances the GDPR provides you the right to erase your Personal Data without undue delay, including when we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected or processed the Personal Data, if you withdraw your consent to consent-based processing, if you object to the processing of the Personal Data under certain rules of the GDPR, if the processing is for the purpose of direct marketing, and if the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed.  However, the GDPR provides exceptions or exclusions to the right to erase, including where the processing is necessary for the exercise of free expression and information, to comply with a legal obligation, or to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.

In some circumstances the GDPR provides the right to restrict the processing of your Personal Data, such as to contest the accuracy of the Personal Data, where the processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure, when we no longer need the Personal Data for the purpose of our processing but you require Personal Data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, and you have objected to the processing pending the verification of that objection.  When processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your Personal Data.  But we will process your data otherwise only with your consent, to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or to protect another natural or legal person’s rights, or for reasons of important public interest.

If applicable, the GDPR provides the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data on grounds relating to your situation, but only to the extent that the processing is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest or to exercise any official authority vested in Driverge, or for a legitimate interest pursued by Driverge or someone else.  If you object, we shall stop processing the Personal Data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds to process the information that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the purpose of the processing is to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.

You may object to our processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes including profiling for direct marketing purposes.  If you notify us of such an objection, we shall stop processing your Personal Data for that purpose.

You may object to our processing of your Personal Data for scientific or historical research or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.

If the legal basis for our processing your Personal Data is consent or that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are a party, or in order to take steps at your request before entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automatic means, you have the right to receive your Personal Data from us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.  But this right does not apply when its Website will adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

If you believe that our processing of your Personal Data infringes any data-protection statute, rule or regulation, you may lodge a complaint with the appropriate authorities responsible for data protection.  If applicable, you may lodge that complaint in the European Union member state of your habitual residence, your workplace, or the place of the alleged infringement.

To the extent that we base our processing of your Personal Data on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time.  But your withdrawal of that consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we do before your withdrawal.

If applicable, you may exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Data by emailing Driverge at [\[email protected\]](https://www.driverge.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Changes to This Privacy Policy:** We reserve the right to change this policy at any time.  We ask that you review this privacy policy from time to time to ensure you are familiar with the most current version of it.

**Acceptance of This Privacy Policy:** By using the Website, you agree to the terms as well as any posted changes of this Privacy Policy.  By using the Website, you hereby consent to the collection and use of this information by Driverge.   If you do not so agree, DO NOT use the Website.
