Accordingly, our policy regarding online privacy has been developed using the following guiding principles: Our dealership maintains a strict “no-spam” policy. Subscribers to our e-mail services (or any other feature or service found on our Web site) will not receive unsolicited e-mail messages from us, except as are set forth in our Opt Out Procedures. Subscribers also may elect to unsubscribe at any time, and e-mails from us will include instructions on how to unsubscribe. You may also contact us as explained below to unsubscribe. Please provide the email address you wish to unsubscribe. Our dealership collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a more relevant experience on our sites. When doing so, we will make every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data. Our dealership will take reasonable physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you provide to us (e.g. data will be stored in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access). Our dealership will not share any information you’ve provided to us with anyone without your consent other than to provide the service you’ve requested and as permitted by applicable law. At the time you register for any such service, you will be notified of, and asked to consent to, the sharing of your information with any particular third party necessary to the provision of the requested service.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Data:** Anytime you visit our Web site, we may gather certain non-personally identifiable information regarding the means you use to access our site. This information may include the type and version of your browser, your service provider, your IP address, cookie identifiers, website activity and any search engine you may have used to locate the site. This information does not include e-mail addresses. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Web site, and compile broad statistical data. In addition, we gather certain navigational information about where you go on our Web sites. This information enables us to determine which areas of the Web sites are most frequently visited and helps us to tailor the sites to the needs and interests of our online visitors. Such information is gathered by us in the aggregate and will not be associated with a specific individual without that individual’s consent.

**Information Voluntarily Provided:** Any information you provide to us (i.e. name, e-mail address, etc.) when you enroll in one of our E-Mail Reminder Services, request information, or use any of the other interactive portions of our Web sites, is securely maintained on our Web server and internal systems. This information may be used to provide you with information you’ve requested about our company, our products and our services, or to provide you with special notices. You may opt out of receiving future marketing communications at any time (see Opt-Out Procedures below). This data may also be used to tailor your experience on our sites by providing content that is relevant to your interests and geographic region.

**Information Collected from Other Sources:** To help us better understand and respond to your needs and interests, we may in the future receive information about you from other sources. We will ask any provider of such information to represent and warrant that the information has been gathered and maintained in accordance with all state and federal laws, and, if applicable, the laws of other countries. Any such information will be maintained by us in accordance with the standards set forth in this privacy policy along with other personal information you’ve provided.

**Disclosure of Personal Information:** Our dealership understands the importance of your privacy. We collect and maintain the personal information of our consumers for our use and our subsidiaries. We do not sell, rent, or trade consumer information to third parties, other than as described below, and never without your consent.

**Business Partners:** Our dealership may partner with select retailers and other companies at various times to provide expanded services to our site visitors. As part of such a relationship, we may share with these companies the use of certain interactive Web site functions (i.e. the E-Mail Reminder Service). Information provided by site visitors through the use of such interactive functions may be available to both our dealership and our partners.

**Agents:** Our dealership may use other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include administering e-mail services and running special promotions. Such parties have access only to the personal information needed to perform these functions and may not use or store the information for any other purpose. Subscribers or site visitors will never receive unsolicited e-mail messages from agents working on our behalf.

**Business Transfers:** In the event that our dealership sells or transfers a particular portion of its business assets, consumer information may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction. If substantially all of the assets of our dealership are acquired, consumer information may be transferred as part of the acquisition.

**Compliance with Law and Safety:** Our dealership may disclose specific personal information based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with or conform to the law or that such disclosure is necessary to protect the users of our Web sites, the sites themselves, or the public.

**With Consent:** Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when any personally-identifiable information about you may be shared with third parties, and you will be given the opportunity to decline to share that information.

**Opt-out Procedures:** You may always opt-out of receiving future marketing communications from our dealership. Our sites allow users to opt-out of receiving such communications at the point where personal information is requested, or through other means as identified.

**Notice about the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations** **(“GDPR”):** You may have certain rights under the European Union’s GDPR 2016/679.  The GDPR is a complex regulatory scheme and we do not intend to provide every detail here.  If interested you should read the GDPR and the relevant guidance provided by the applicable authorities for a fuller explanation.

The GDPR provides the right, where applicable, to (a) access, (b) publication, (c) erasure, (d) restrict processing, (e) object to processing, (f) data portability, (g) complain to a supervisory authority, and (h) withdraw consent.

Where applicable, the GDPR provides the right to confirm whether Driverge has processed your Personal Data (as defined in the GDPR) and, when Driverge, to access those data, together with certain other information including the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned, and the recipients of the Personal Data.  Where applicable, and providing that we do not affect the rights and freedoms of anyone else, we will supply you with one copy of your Personal Data.  The first copy is free.  We may charge a reasonable fee for additional copies.

Where applicable, the GDPR provides the rights to rectify any inaccurate Personal Data about you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to complete any incomplete data about you.

In some circumstances the GDPR provides you the right to erase your Personal Data without undue delay, including when we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected or processed the Personal Data, if you withdraw your consent to consent-based processing, if you object to the processing of the Personal Data under certain rules of the GDPR, if the processing is for the purpose of direct marketing, and if the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed.  However, the GDPR provides exceptions or exclusions to the right to erase, including where the processing is necessary for the exercise of free expression and information, to comply with a legal obligation, or to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.

In some circumstances the GDPR provides the right to restrict the processing of your Personal Data, such as to contest the accuracy of the Personal Data, where the processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure, when we no longer need the Personal Data for the purpose of our processing but you require Personal Data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, and you have objected to the processing pending the verification of that objection.  When processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your Personal Data.  But we will process your data otherwise only with your consent, to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or to protect another natural or legal person’s rights, or for reasons of important public interest.

If applicable, the GDPR provides the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data on grounds relating to your situation, but only to the extent that the processing is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest or to exercise any official authority vested in Driverge, or for a legitimate interest pursued by Driverge or someone else.  If you object, we shall stop processing the Personal Data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds to process the information that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the purpose of the processing is to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
