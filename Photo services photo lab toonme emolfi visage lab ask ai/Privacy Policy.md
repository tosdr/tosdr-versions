Privacy Policy
==============

This Privacy Policy describes how LINEROCK INVESTMENTS LTD. (**"LINEROCK INVESTMENTS"**, **"We"**, **"Us"**, or **"Our"**) protects your privacy when you use LINEROCK INVESTMENTS services (**"Services"**) which includes the Web site located at [pho.to](https://pho.to/) the "Site") and all LINEROCK INVESTMENTS mobile phone applications (**"Mobile"**).

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW, YOU MAY NOT USE THE LINEROCK INVESTMENTS SERVICES.

This Privacy Policy together with our [Terms of Service](https://pho.to/terms) applies to information (including personal information) collected during your use of LINEROCK INVESTMENTS services. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Personal information does not include technical, device, or usage information that cannot be used to identify you personally, nor does it include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a group or category of Services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information have been removed. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate and non-personal information, and we may share such data about our users with third parties for various purposes.

What Information We  
Collect
-----------------------------

We respect the privacy of every individual who uses our Services. We collect certain personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we collect your name, email address, user name, social network information and other information you provide when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our services. We may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with the information we collect on the Services.

With your permission (on download or in the app), we may access and store the Content (your user name and photos) you provided while using our Mobile applications and Site. We may also edit stored photos, apply effects to them and use them to perform marketing activities. Yet in this case we will show your photos or your edited photos solely to you (for example by sending promotional e-mails you opted-in for).

LOGIN DATA
----------

In order to share your content within apps and services where such an option is provided you will be asked to log in.

If you connect your Facebook, Apple ID, or other third-party accounts to one of our apps, we use information from those accounts (like your username or profile picture). You can choose to stop sharing this information with us at any time by going to Facebook or other third-party accounts and removing our access.

With your prior explicit consent, we may also collect information about others from third party platforms such as social media sites, for example when you log in to our apps using the login information of other social media sites.

We also collect visual information through the images that you post to our services, including your profile photos.

You can always request the removal of your account and all related data by [contacting our support team](mailto:support@pho.to).

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
---------------------

When you use a website or mobile application like ours, certain internet and network activity information gets generated and logged automatically. These are the types of technical information we collect:

**Log data**. Our servers passively keep an electronic record of your interactions with our apps, which we call "log data". For example, when you visit our website, sign into our services, or browse content, we collect data about these interactions that includes where you navigate within our website and apps, your IP address, browser type and settings, the date and time of your visit, search terms, which elements of our site and services you use the most, device data, and cookie data. We use log data to operate our services, maintain security, ensure reliable performance, and improve your experience.

When you visit the Site, we automatically collect some information. Such information includes the type of browser you use, your browser’s language, access time or the website from which you linked to us. We also collect information about your computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity on the Site.

**Cookie data**. We use "cookies" and similar technologies to collect log data and operate our services. You can learn more about how we use cookies in "COOKIES" below.

**Device data**. We collect and combine data about the devices you use to access our apps and services, and data about your device usage and activity.

**Metadata of visual information**. We collect the metadata linked to your content. For example, your images may be accompanied by additional content like a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords), comments. This makes your content more searchable by others and more interactive.

All this information is only used to assist us in providing an effective service. We may, from time to time, supply the owners and operators of third party websites and mobile applications which have a link to our site or application with information about the number of users of our Site or Mobile. You cannot be identified from any of this information.

SERVICE DATA
------------

To use our Services, you should provide a photo prior to the event of photo editing. Since the processing requires Internet connection and is performed on our servers the photos are sent there through the encrypted connection. We use Secure Socket Layer technology to protect the privacy and integrity of the transmission process.

For non-registered users and users who don’t share their results within the Services, the original photos and results are automatically removed from our servers by two weeks after the last interaction. For registered users who share their results within the Services that provide special social network features, the shared content will be stored on the servers and shown within the Services unless a user either removes the images themselves or requests such a removal by [contacting our support team](mailto:support@pho.to).

In addition, most of the Services involve facial recognition mechanism, which is used in two ways:

* **Locally on your device.** Provided that the access to Gallery is granted we use facial recognition mechanism to scan your Gallery for facial photos and group them. This makes part of the recommendation system and can also be used in other ways with the only aim to improve your experience within the Service. The detected facial key points are stored on your device until you delete the Service or clear the Service data.
* **On the server.** Whenever you apply an effect that involves a face manipulation we use other special face recognition technologies on the server side in order to:  
    \- detect a face in a photo;  
    \- find required facial key points (the set of points varies with the effect);  
    \- and apply the effect to your photo based on the detected key points.

In this case the key points are temporarily cached in server’s RAM between processings and get removed shortly after the last effect has been applied to the corresponding photo.

Cookies
-------

We automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small data files that are stored locally. We use cookies to collect information about your device, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report information to our branded partners.

We may store some information locally when you visit the Site or use Services. This information facilitates your use of the site or Sevices, personalizes your experience, and helps us to remember your preferences. The information stored in a cookie provides features that recognize your account as logged on and other Site or Serveces features. We do not have any control over cookies which our advertisers or branded partners may use.

Security
--------

The technology that we use and the policies that we have implemented are intended to safeguard your privacy from unauthorized access and improper use. We will continue to update these measures as new technology becomes available. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures.

If you believe your password has been misused or your account compromised, please advise us immediately.
