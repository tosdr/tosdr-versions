5. **Independent Contractors.** Lemon.io is not an employment service or employment agency, and Lemon.io does not employ Developers. In all cases, Developers are independent contractors and not employees of Lemon.io. That means Developers are free to accept or reject any Services, perform Services free from the supervision and control of Lemon.io, and provide their own tools and equipment. It is the obligation of Clients to supervise and control the Services performed by Developers. All contracts, agreements and arrangements for the completion of Services are between Clients and Developers, and Lemon.io is not a party to that relationship. As such, Lemon.io does not withhold taxes including, without limitation, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, social security or other payroll withholdings.

6. **Connecting Users; No Control.** The Platform leverages a proprietary algorithm to connect Users for Services based on numerous factors including, without limitation, Client criteria and Developer skills. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lemon.io does not have control over any aspect of any Services including, without limitation, the legality, timing, quality, performance or non-performance thereof. Further, Lemon.io does not supervise or control any aspect of the Services performed by Developers, and Clients are responsible for supervising and controlling the Services performed by Developers. As such, Lemon.io makes no representations, warranties or covenants about any aspect of any Services performed. 
7. **Client Subscription Fees.** Clients agree to pay Lemon.io the subscription fees associated with the selected subscription for the Services of Developers (“Subscription Fee”). All Subscription Fees must be paid directly to Lemon.io in advance through the Platform. Clients agree that it shall maintain a positive balance of an amount equal to not less than: (A) one (1) week’s worth of the Services of Developers for weekly Subscription Fees paid by debit card or credit card for the subsequent week’s Services; and, (B) one (1) month’s worth of the Services of Developers for monthly Subscription Fees invoiced and/or paid by ACH or wire transfer for the subsequent month’s Services.

Clients may request to pause their subscription at any time by using the “Request to pause” feature in Client’s account. Please note, that in case you didn’t pay your due Client Subscription Fee or your last payment was fully spent for the Developer Payments for Services – you are not able to request for / order new Services / set tasks on the Platform, including to those Developers you already interact with, and any Developers you interact with will receive the in-Platform notification that you are out of funds on the Platform and appropriate Services will not be paid for. We encourage you to pay all the Client Subscription Fees on time and in amount sufficient for the Services you are about to request / order on or through the Platform.
8. **Developer Placement Fees.** In the event that Clients hire or contract with Developers directly, or pay Developers off the Platform, Clients agree to pay Lemon.io an amount equal to fourteen thousand U.S. dollars ($14,000 USD) as a direct placement fee and not as a penalty (“Placement Fee”). Clients agree to pay such Placement Fee within five (5) days of such direct hire, contract or payment, as applicable. Clients hereby authorize Lemon.io to charge the credit card or debit card on file for the Placement Fee associated with such direct hire, contract or payment, as applicable. In the event that such credit card or debit card cannot be charged for the Placement Fee, such Client agrees that it shall pay the Placement Fee pursuant to the invoice therefor.
9. **Late or Non-Payment.** For any payment due to Lemon.io that is more than three (3) business days past due including, without limitation, Subscription Fees and Placement Fees, fifteen percent (15%) interest will be added to the total amount due, compounded each thirty (30) days after payment is due, in addition to collections costs and fees incurred including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, court costs and other related collection expenses. In case  you delayed the payment in our favour for more than 30 calendar days, we may file a claim to South West Recovery Services. assigning them to collect the indebtedness from you. You will have to pay for their services in amount of about 25% of then current indebtedness amount or reimburse such services cost. After the delayed payment is collected and we receive the money we shall exercise the Developer Payment in whose favour appropriate payment was delayed - proportionally to the share of the delayed payment we actually received.
10. **Developer Payments.** Developers are paid for Services on a “time and materials” basis, which means that Developers are paid according to their hourly rate for the time spent performing Services, the tools and equipment required to perform the Services and approved expenses (if applicable). Acting as the Developer you can not discuss your hourly rate with other Users - only with the Lemon.io team. Developers are paid by the 10th of the month following the month in which such Services are performed and previously paid by the respective Client(s), provided however that any payment may be received with a delay caused by the receiving party or its servicing bank. On the basis that the Platform is just a venue for the Services rendering and irrespective to any other provisions and conditions, any Developer Payments may be made exclusively in case Client Subscription Fees are duly paid in amount sufficient to cover appropriate Developer Payment and received by Lemon.io and / or appropriate Services are not disputed by the Client. Hence, if we received only part of the due Client Subscription Fees it means respective Developer Payments will be partially and proportionally paid as well.
11. **Partner Payments.** Partners are paid by Lemon.io for the Services of Partner-sourced Developers on a “time and materials” basis, which means that Developers are paid for the time spent performing Services, the tools and equipment required to perform the Services and approved expenses (if applicable).

Partners are paid for the Services of Partner-sourced Developers by the 10th of the month following the month in which such Services are performed by such Developers. Partners are paid their portion of the Placement Fees received by Lemon.io and owed to Partners by the 10th of the month following the month in which such Placement Fee was received by Lemon.io. You should remember that any payment hereunder may be received with a delay caused by the receiving party or its servicing bank

15. **Code of conduct.** Acting as a Developer on the Platform you should obey this simple code of conduct (see below in this Section 15 and Section 16) and remain professionals in the best meaning of the word. Any Developer agrees to maintain professional conduct throughout the trial, separate tasks completion, and full-time employment periods, including respecting deadlines, being responsive, and engaging in clear communication with a Client. Any instances of unethical behavior, including but not limited to discrimination, harassment, or inappropriate conduct, will urge us to reconsider whether you can still remain to be a User of the Platform or your continued use of the Platform causes too much difficulty or inconvenience to other Users or directly to us.

All disputes must be reported using the “Report a problem” feature in Clients’ account. All disputes on the Platform are decided by the Lemon.io acting as the arbiter, while both disputing parties undertake to provide Lemon.io with their arguments and proofs of their positions. Decisions taken by the Lemon.io for such on-Platform disputes are deemed full and unchallenged. Clients understand and agree that the only remedy for such dispute is the reperformance of the Services that are the subject of such dispute and, where such Services cannot reasonably and adequately be reperformed, the maximum remedy is the refund of an amount equal to the hours paid for the disputed Services up to a maximum of forty (40) hours. You should note that no payments, including Developer Payments and Partner Payments are made for the disputed Services or their results unless such disputes are solved within the Platform. You can certainly file your dispute to a court and these Terms do not limit you in any way, but the dispute within the Platform can already be resolved and executed by us till that time and you can only challenge the result of the dispute directly with the other disputing party in the court without any attraction of Lemon.io.
