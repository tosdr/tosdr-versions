TERMS OF USE
============

Last updated 06/16/2023

These terms of use (“Terms of Use”) set forth the terms and conditions of Coding Ninjas Inc. d/b/a Lemon.io (“us”, “our”, and "Lemon.io") applicable to your (“you”, “your” and “yourself”) use of the Lemon.io website located at [https://lemon.io](https://lemon.io/), and any related software, applications, services and/or products (collectively the “Platform”), including without limitation your use of the Platform: (A) to obtain development services as a "Client” (B) to perform development services as a "Developer" and/or (C) to partner with us to provide developers to clients as a “Partner.” Your use of the Platform constitutes your agreement to all of the terms and conditions in the Terms of Use, and Lemon.io encourages you to read the Terms of Use carefully. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and any other agreement, whether written or oral, between Lemon.io and you, whether in your individual capacity or as the representative of a Client, Developer, or Partner, these Terms of Use shall supersede and control. **_IF YOU OBJECT TO ANYTHING IN THE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING THE JURY WAIVER AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 25, OR OTHERWISE DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT USE THE PLATFORM AND EXIT IMMEDIATELY, AS YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THE PLATFORM._**

For purposes of the Terms of Use, “Lemon.io” means and includes Lemon.io and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its and their investors, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and assigns. “User” means each person who accesses or uses the Platform, including Clients, Developers and Partners. 

You understand and agree that Lemon.io may revise, modify and/or supplement the Terms of Use (the “Revised Terms of Use”) at any time. Any Revised Terms of Use will be effective immediately after notice is sent to you via email. If you do not agree to the Revised Terms of Use, you must stop using the Platform and close your account. You can deactivate your account by emailing us at support@lemon.io. By continuing to use the Platform following notice, or by failing to deactivate your account, you hereby expressly agree to be bound by the Revised Terms of Use and acknowledge that your continued use of the Platform is valid consideration for the Revised Terms of Use.

**General Terms**  

1. **Privacy Policy**. Refer to the Lemon.io Privacy Policy at [https://lemon.io/privacy-policy/](https://lemon.io/privacy-policy/) for information on how Lemon.io collects, uses and discloses information about you. 
2. **License**. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Terms of Use, Lemon.io grants you a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to access and use the Platform solely for your personal, noncommercial use. Rights not expressly granted to you in the Terms of Use are reserved by Lemon.io.
3. **Platform Eligibility**. To be eligible to use the Platform, you represent, warrant and covenant that you: (A) Are eighteen (18) years of age or older; (B) Have full power and authority to enter into the Terms of Use and to be bound by the Terms of Use; (C) Will not violate any other agreement to which you are a party by agreeing to the Terms of Use; (D) Are not restricted from using the Platform in any way or for any reason; (E) Are not using the Platform for reasons that are in competition with or adverse to Lemon.io; and (F) Will only maintain one account at any given time.
4. **Platform is a Venue**. The Platform offers a venue where Clients and Developers connect for the performance of development services (“Services”). Clients and Developers contract directly with each other and Lemon.io is not a party to any contracts or agreements between them. By using the Platform, you understand and agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, franchise or agency relationship exists between you and Lemon.io or Lemon.io and any other User. 
5. **Independent Contractors**. Lemon.io is not an employment service or employment agency, and Lemon.io does not employ Developers. In all cases, Developers are independent contractors and not employees of Lemon.io. That means Developers are free to accept or reject any Services, perform Services free from the supervision and control of Lemon.io, and provide their own tools and equipment. It is the obligation of Clients to supervise and control the Services performed by Developers. All contracts, agreements and arrangements for the completion of Services are between Clients and Developers, and Lemon.io is not a party to that relationship. As such, Lemon.io does not withhold taxes including, without limitation, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, social security or other payroll withholdings. You understand and agree that if Lemon.io is found liable for any taxes, other than on Lemon.io’ income, you will immediately reimburse and pay to Lemon.io an equivalent amount, including any interest and penalties thereon. 
6. **Connecting Users; No Control**. The Platform leverages a proprietary algorithm to connect Users for Services based on numerous factors including, without limitation, Client criteria and Developer skills. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lemon.io does not have control over any aspect of any Services including, without limitation, the legality, timing, quality, performance or non-performance thereof. Further, Lemon.io does not supervise or control any aspect of the Services performed by Developers, and Clients are responsible for supervising and controlling the Services performed by Developers. As such, Lemon.io makes no representations, warranties or covenants about any aspect of any Services performed.
7. **Client Subscription Fees**. Clients agree to pay Lemon.io the subscription fees associated with the selected subscription for the Services of Developers (“Subscription Fee”). All Subscription Fees must be paid directly to Lemon.io in advance through the Platform. Clients agree that it shall maintain a positive balance of an amount equal to not less than: (A) one (1) week’s worth of the Services of Developers for weekly Subscription Fees paid by debit card or credit card for the subsequent week’s Services; and, (B) one (1) month’s worth of the Services of Developers for monthly Subscription Fees invoiced and/or paid by ACH or wire transfer for the subsequent month’s Services. For Subscription Fees paid by debit card or credit card, Clients hereby authorize Lemon.io to charge the credit card or debit card for the Subscription Fees associated with the selected subscription plus any amounts owed for Services of Developers that exceed the selected subscription. Clients may request to pause their subscription at any time by using the “Request to pause” feature in Client’s account.
8. **Developer Placement Fees**. In the event that Clients hire or contract with Developers directly, or pay Developers off the Platform, Clients agree to pay Lemon.io an amount equal to fourteen thousand U.S. dollars ($14,000 USD) as a direct placement fee and not as a penalty (“Placement Fee”). Clients agree to pay such Placement Fee within five (5) days of such direct hire, contract or payment, as applicable. Clients hereby authorize Lemon.io to charge the credit card or debit card on file for the Placement Fee associated with such direct hire, contract or payment, as applicable. In the event that such credit card or debit card cannot be charged for the Placement Fee, such Client agrees that it shall pay the Placement Fee pursuant to the invoice therefor.
9. **Late or Non Payment**. For any payment due to Lemon.io that is more than three (3) business days past due including, without limitation, Subscription Fees and Placement Fees, fifteen percent (15%) interest will be added to the total amount due, compounded each thirty (30) days after payment is due, in addition to collections costs and fees incurred including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, court costs and other related collection expenses.
10. **Developer Payments**. Developers are paid for Services on a “time and materials” basis, which means that Developers are paid for the time spent performing Services, the tools and equipment required to perform the Services and approved expenses (if applicable). Developers are paid by the 10th of the month following the month in which such Services are performed. 
11. **Partner Payments**. Partners are paid by Lemon.io for the Services of Partner-sourced Developers on a “time and materials” basis, which means that Developers are paid for the time spent performing Services, the tools and equipment required to perform the Services and approved expenses (if applicable). In the event that Clients hire or contract with Partner-sourced Developers directly, or pay Partner-sourced Developers off the Platform, Lemon.io shall pay Partner fifty percent (50%) of Placement Fees received by Lemon.io for such Developers. Partners are paid for the Services of Partner-sourced Developers by the 10th of the month following the month in which such Services are performed by such Developers. Partners are paid their portion of the Placement Fees received by Lemon.io and owed to Partners by the 10th of the month following the month in which such Placement Fee was received by Lemon.io.
12. **Developer Restrictions**. As a Developer, you represent, warrant and covenant that you are not: (A) a citizen or resident of, or located in, a geographic area that is subject to U.S. sanctions or embargoes; (B) an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the U.S. Department of State’s Debarred Parties List or otherwise ineligible to receive items subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations or other economic sanction rules.
13. **Disputes Between Clients and Developers**. Clients understand and agree that it is their obligation to communicate directly with Developers and to supervise and control the Services performed by Developers. In the event of any disputes between Clients and Developers including, without limitation, disputes related to the quality of Services performed by Developers, Clients agree that such disputes must be brought to Lemon.io within ten (10) business days following the month in which such disputed Services were performed. All disputes must be reported using the “Report a problem” feature in Clients’ account. Clients understand and agree that the only remedy for such dispute is the reperformance of the Services that are the subject of such dispute and, where such Services cannot reasonably and adequately be reperformed, the maximum remedy is the refund of an amount equal to the hours paid for the disputed Services up to a maximum of forty (40) hours. 
14. **Account Security**. You represent, warrant and covenant that at all times you will: (A) Maintain the security and confidentiality of your account information, including, without limitation, your username and password; (B) Be responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, whether by you or by others; (C) Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your profile, the need to deactivate your profile due to security concerns, or any other breach of security; (D) Be liable for all charges, damages and losses incurred or suffered by you and/or by Lemon.io as a result of activity under your account; and, (E) Ensure that you log out of your account at the end of each session.
