If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s or legal guardian’s express consent.

We do not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale of such information in a way that specifically identifies the individual (i.e. we don’t sell customer lists). You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using some or all of the Services.  

Collection of Information
-------------------------

### Personal Information:

When using or registering to use the Services, we may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your device. For the sake of clarity, we do not collect information regarding your name, email, phone number, or personal contacts in any way when you register for or use the Services. When using the Services, you may voluntarily provide us with personally identifiable information, such as when communicating with us or uploading a profile picture. Such information is referred to below as your “Personal Contact Information.”  
  
We may also obtain Personal Contact Information about you in other ways, both during and after registration.  
  
One such way is if you voluntarily provide us your email address. After registering to use the Services, you have the option to provide us an email address to associate with your Plato user account. This is entirely voluntary and your decision not to do so will not impact your ability to use the Services. Please be aware that we may have difficulty recovering your account information in the event of an emergency if we do not have an email address associated with your account.  
  
When purchasing products on the Services, we may require you to provide financial and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number (“Billing Information”). Your Personal Contact Information and your Billing Information, together with any other information we gather through the Services that may be used to identify, contact, or locate you individually, are collectively referred to herein as your “Personal Information.”

You may be able to create, upload, publish, transmit, distribute, display, store or share information, data, text, graphics, video, messages or other materials using our Services (this is collectively referred to below as “Data”). Some of this Data may be stored and maintained on our servers. If you run into technical errors in the course of using the Services, we may request your permission to obtain a crash report along with certain logging information from your system documenting the error (“Diagnostic Information”). Such information may contain information regarding your Operating System version, hardware, browser version (and .NET version information in case of Windows systems), and your email address, if provided. Additionally, certain login information may be maintained in a cookie stored locally on your personal computing device (i.e. not on a server) in order to streamline the login process (“Login Information”).

### Usage and Analytics Information:

As you use our Services, we may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies, log files, and Web beacons. Such Information may include standard information regarding your mobile device, browser type, browser language, Operating System, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on our web site (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked) or while using the Services. Collectively, this information is referred to as “Usage and Analytics Information.”  
  
We use Google Analytics to obtain some of the Usage and Analytics Information.Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.  
  
You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with GoogleAnalytics about visits activity.

We do not use GPS technology to collect any information regarding your precise real-time geo-location while using the Services. However, we may use elements of your Usage and Analytics Information (such as your IP address) to determine your generalized location. This information is referred to as “Generalized Geo-Location Information.”

### Billing Information:

We use Billing Information to manage your account, to provide the Services, and to check the financial qualifications of prospective customers and to collect payment for the Services.

Sharing Information with Other Users and Third Parties
------------------------------------------------------

#### Public and Private Messaging

Our Services provide you the ability to send messages to particular users (“Private Messages”), as well as to post messages in public chat rooms (“Public Messages”).  
  
Private Messages are only made available to the specific user you designate. We store information in Private Messages only until the recipient receives it on their device. The recipient will only receive a Private Message when they log into their account. If the recipient does not log into their account within 30 days after you send a Private Message to them, we will delete the message from our systems.  
  
Public Messages are sent to everyone in the chat room in which the message is sent. We do not monitor who participates in a public chat room. So, it is safe to assume that anything you send through a Public Message will become public information.  
  
We encourage you to be mindful of what you put into a messages you send through the Services. If there is information you would prefer to remain private, we would recommend you not include it in either Private Messages or Public Messages. Remember that we cannot control how recipients will use the information they obtain from your messages.  
  
We rely on you not to abuse these messaging features. You are not permitted to use this feature to send spam, harass others, or, in the case of Private Messages, contact people who you do not have the right to contact electronically. You are also not permitted to use this feature to send personal information about third parties. So, please do not include such information in any Public Messages or Private Messages.

### Inviting Others to Use Our Services

Our Services allow you to send invitations for your friends or others to use our Services. We offer you the ability to send these invitations by email or through certain social media platforms. We do not store or retain any personal information (including names, emails, or social media information) about the people to whom you send invitations, nor do we store any custom messages you may include in these invitations.  
  
We rely on you not to abuse this feature. You are not permitted to use this feature to send spam, harass others, or contact people who you do not have the right to contact electronically. You are also not permitted to use this feature to send personal information about third parties. So, please do not include such information in any custom messages.

### Other Information Sharing

As part of our commitment to our user’s privacy, we store Public Messages and Private Messages on our system only until they reach the recipients. Once a Public Message reaches the users in the chat room or a Private Message reaches its recipient, the message is stored locally on the recipients’ devices. We no longer store the messages on our system. We have no mechanism to force recipients to delete a Public Message or Private Message they’ve received.  
  
You may be able to share Personal Information with third parties through use of the Services. The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours. The use of any information that you may provide to any third parties will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party or by your independent agreement with such third party, as the case may be. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing to a third party, we recommend that you contact that third party directly for more information or to review its privacy policy.  

Retention
---------

We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you request that your Personal Information be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all of your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.
