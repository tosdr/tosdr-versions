Terms of Service
================

Last updated: May 24, 2018  

Introduction  

---------------

Welcome to Plato! Your use of Plato’s services, including the services Plato makes available through the Plato app, the Plato app website, and any other software or services offered by Plato in connection with any of those (the “Services”) is governed by these terms of use (the “Terms”), so please carefully read them before using the Services. For the purposes of these Terms, “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Plato” refer to Plato Team Inc., the providers and operators of the Services.  
  
In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms. If you are registering for or using the Services on behalf of an organization or another individual, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization or individual and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization or individual to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will also refer to that organization or individual, wherever possible.  
  
You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services. If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child’s use of the Services.  
  
You agree your purchases and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Plato or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.  
  
BY USING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS INCLUDED IN OR WITH THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.  

Your Account  

---------------

In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to provide Plato with certain information, such as a username (“Credentials”). Plato handles such information with the utmost attention, care and security. Nonetheless, you, not Plato, shall be responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials in connection with the Services. You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Plato of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your account has been hacked or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify Plato immediately.  

Content  

----------

A variety of games, information, reviews, recommendations, messages, comments, posts, text, graphics, software, photographs, videos, data, and other materials ("Content") may be made available through the Services by Plato or its suppliers (“Plato-Supplied Content”). While Plato strives to keep the Content that it provides through the Services accurate, complete, and up-to-date, Plato cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Plato-Supplied Content.  
  
You acknowledge that you may also be able to create, transmit, publish or display information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) through use of the Services. All such information is referred to below as “User Content.” User Content also includes any information or data you include in any messages, invitations, or public or private chat messages you send or share through the Services.  
  
You agree that there is no tolerance for Objectionable Content or abusive users. Content may be submitted to Plato, who will moderate all content and ultimately decide whether or not to post a submission to the extent such content includes, is in conjunction with, or alongside any, Objectionable Content. Objectionable Content includes, but is not limited to: (i) sexually explicit materials; (ii) obscene, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, violent and/or unlawful content or profanity; (iii) content that infringes upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary right, or that is deceptive or fraudulent; (iv) content that promotes the use or sale of illegal or regulated substances, tobacco products, ammunition and/or firearms.  
  
You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Plato has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any User Content, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Plato may suffer) in connection with such User Content. If you are registering for these Services on behalf of an organization or individual, you also agree that you are also responsible for the actions of associated Users and for any User Content that such associated Users might upload, record, publish, post, link to, or otherwise transmit or distribute through use of the Services. Furthermore, you acknowledge that Plato does not control or actively monitor Content uploaded by users and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You acknowledge that by using the Services, you may be exposed to materials that are offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Plato be liable in any way for any such Content.  
  
You agree that you will not include in any User Content any personally identifiable information about any other person.  
  
Plato may refuse to store, provide, or otherwise maintain your User Content for any or no reason. Plato may remove your User Content from the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended. If User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, Plato may also delete the User Content as of that date. User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable. You agree that Plato has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any User Content or other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Services.  
  
Plato reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove User Content from the Services, in its discretion. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates these Terms, including pursuant to a takedown request from Plato. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from Plato to take down certain Content, Plato reserves the right to directly take down such Content.  

License from You  

-------------------

By submitting, posting or otherwise uploading User Content on or through the Services you give Plato a worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully sub-licensable, royalty-free right and license as set below:  
• with respect to User Content that you submit, post or otherwise make publicly or generally available via the Services (e.g. public forum posts), the license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute , publicly perform, and publicly display such User Content (in whole or part) worldwide via the Services or otherwise, and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for any legal business purpose; and  
• with respect to User Content that you submit, post or otherwise transmit privately via the Services (e.g. via private chat messages with other Users), the license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display such User Content for the sole purpose of enabling Plato to provide you with the Services.  
  

Proprietary Rights  

---------------------

You acknowledge and agree that Plato (or Plato’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services and Plato-Supplied Content and that the Services and Plato-Supplied Content are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights and laws (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).  
Except as provided in Section 4, Plato acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you create, submit, post, transmit, share or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Plato, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Plato has no obligation to do so on your behalf.
