#### Who we are and how to contact us

These Terms of Use apply to our websites, mobile applications, and related online and offline offerings (collectively, the “**Services**”). The Services include websites at fandom.com and wikia.org, and the respective subdomains, and the mobile apps provided under the Fandom brand. The Services also include the websites at futhead.com and muthead.com. The Services are operated by Fandom, Inc. (with its affiliates, “**Fandom**” or the “Company”). We are a company registered in the State of Delaware, U.S.A. (corporate number C2935209), whose registered office is at 550 California Street, Suite 830 San Francisco, CA 94104.

#### Trademarks

Fandom, the Fandom logos, Wikia, and any other product or service name, logo, or slogan used by Fandom, and the look and feel of the Services, including all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts, are trademarks or trade dress of Fandom, and may not be used in whole or in part in connection with any product or service that is not Fandom’s, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that disparages or discredits Fandom, without our prior written permission. Any use of these trademarks must be in accordance with any guidelines that Fandom may provide you from time to time.

All other trademarks referenced in the Services are the property of their respective owners. Reference on the Services to any products, services, processes or other information, by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier, or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation thereof by us or any other affiliation.

#### Submitting content to the services and copyrights

There are different rules for content that is submitted to Fandom communities, for Company Original Content, and for contributions to our discussions and chat forums, each of which are described below.

In all cases, you are solely responsible for all content, including but not limited to photos, profile information, messages, comments, and other content that you upload, publish or display (hereinafter, “submit”) on or through the Services, or transmit to or share with other users. You may not submit content to the Services that you did not create or that you do not have the right to submit. You may not submit content that is not compatible with the license used by the applicable part of the Services to which you are submitting content. You understand and agree that others may, but are not obligated to, edit, delete or remove (without notice) any content from the Services, for any reason or no reason. You also represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, releases, consents, and permissions to permit the Company to copy, store, publish, display, and distribute your content via the Services, in accordance with the license rules that are applicable to such content (for example, text submissions by you to Fandom communities are subject to the licensing terms set forth at [Licensing](https://www.fandom.com/licensing)).

The Services are not and shall not function as an archive. We have no liability to you or any other person for loss, damage, or destruction to your content. You are solely responsible at your sole cost and expense for creating backup copies and replacing any content you post or store on the Services or provide to us.

#### Content that is submitted to fandom communities or wikis

The license rules for text that is submitted to particular Fandom communities or wikis are set forth at [our licensing page](https://www.fandom.com/licensing). You agree that you will not use the communities in any manner that is contrary to the [Community Creation Policy](https://www.fandom.com/community-creation-policy), which may be updated from time to time. You also agree not to utilize the communities/wikis in any manner that is contrary to the Fandom Community Guidelines, which may be updated from time to time. In the case of non-text content that a user submits to a particular Fandom community or wiki, you agree that you have the right to submit such content, and that such content does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other personal or proprietary right of any other party.

#### Company original content

Articles and content that are created by the Company or one of its licensors (for example, Company-created content that appears on fandom.com) (collectively, the “**Company Original Content**”) is the exclusive property of the Company and its licensors and is protected by copyright and intellectual property laws and treaties, and all rights are reserved. Such Company Original Content includes visual content such as videos, articles, photographs, graphics, and logos and non-visual content such as music. Such Content may be accessible via a player embedded on the Services, which links to and plays content hosted on other sites or services (“**Media Player**”).

Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license to the Company Original Content, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from the Company Original Content. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company provides you with a license to use the Company Original Content for your personal, noncommercial use only. Company may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason. Use of Company Original Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.

We may provide opportunities to third parties (including community members) to submit an application to provide original content, which Company may approve or deny in its sole discretion. If such original content is accepted by Company, it shall be subject to the rules for Company Original Content that are set forth above and that a contributor may agree to as part of the application process.

The Company may also provide links to articles on third party websites, as set forth below under Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability. Because the Company has no control over such third party websites, the Company is not responsible for the availability of such websites and is not responsible for any content on such websites.

#### Content submitted to discussions forums or quizzes

By submitting content (including comments) to our discussion or chat forums or creating or responding to quizzes or similar games, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display such submitted content (including comments and quizzes) in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so (this license right includes the name, identity, likeness and voice you submit with such content).
