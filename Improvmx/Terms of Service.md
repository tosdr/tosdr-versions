1. You won’t send spam!
2. You won’t use purchased, rented, or third-party lists of email addresses.
3. You won’t use ImprovMX as a list of diffusion or email group list
4. You won’t use ImprovMX as a destination to handle email campaign bounce reports
5. You won’t use ImprovMX for the sole purpose of going through a third-party service’s email verification (e.g. but not limited to “creating social network profiles at scale” or “entering survey contests with multiple ImprovMX aliases under the same name”).

Your paying subscription will be terminated, and you won’t be offered a refund for previous payments.
