If you have general questions about Megaphone’s policies or terms, please email [contact-megaphone@spotify.com](mailto:contact-megaphone@spotify.com).

Privacy Policy
--------------

Effective Date: September 1, 2024

Megaphone, a service offered by Spotify (“**Megaphone**,” “**we**,” or “**us**”). Megaphone is committed to treating the personal data we process with respect and sensitivity. We want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data. This Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”) aims to explain what we mean in further detail below.

**1\. About this Policy**

This Policy sets out the essential details relating to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal data you use the website, Publisher Platform, Advertiser Services, and any other products and services that link to this Policy (collectively, the "**Services**"). 

In this policy we describe our personal data processing activities for the following types of data subjects: 

* Publishers (“**Publishers**”) who use our publisher-facing product (the “**Publisher Platform**”) that helps publishers of podcasts monetize their podcasts by inserting ads into the podcasts hosted by Megaphone. Advertisers (“**Advertisers**”) who use our advertiser-facing services (the “**Advertiser Services**”) to help reach targeted audiences (“**Advertiser Dashboard**”).
* Listeners (“**Listeners**”) of podcasts hosted by Megaphone, whether they are listening on Spotify or other third party audio streaming services. 

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.

This policy is not…

* the Megaphone Terms of Service or Community Guidelines, which are separate documents.
* About your use of other services offered by Podsights affiliates which have their own privacy policy, such as the Spotify service, Anchor, Megaphone, Soundtrap, and Spotify Live.

If you are a Listener, depending on the service on which you listen to podcasts (e.g., Spotify or another service), that service’s privacy policies may apply to you in addition to this Policy, which may contain additional disclosures and rights. 

**2\. Your Personal Data Rights and Controls**

See section ‘Object’ below<br><br>You can request that we stop this processing temporarily or permanently. |
| **Object** | **Object to us processing your personal data.**<br><br>You can do this if Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of legitimate interests. |
| **Data portability** | **Request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service.**<br><br>You can request us to transmit your data when we are processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent or performance of contract. However Spotify will try to honour any request to the extent possible. |
| **Not be subject to automated decision making** | **Request a manual review of a decision based solely on automated decision making** (decisions without human involvement), including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect. <br><br>We currently do not use automated decision-making. |

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). We may decline requests to exercise these rights where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

If your request is denied you may have the right to appeal the denial in accordance with the instructions provided to you when the denial was made.

CCPA rights request metrics

Between January 1 and December 31, 2023, we have not received any verifiable requests for access or deletion of data that we are the controllers of.

**5\. Sharing of Information**

With respect to personal data we are controllers of, we may share or disclose the  data under the following circumstances, or as otherwise described in this Policy:

* Within the Spotify group of companies, including companies that Spotify acquires. To carry out our daily business operations and so we can maintain, improve and provide the Spotify Service and acquired companies’ services to you.
* Service Providers. We may share your information with our agents and service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as to host our Services, manage databases, facilitate payment or send communications for us. We have direct relationships with certain advertising, marketing and analytics services (including some of our measurement partners) who also are our service providers that help us collect and analyze personal data.
* Content providers. We may share your information with content providers for activities such as listenership and content analysis, but only in a pseudonymised format.
* In connection with a transfer of assets. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your personal data to one or more third parties as part of that transaction;
* To comply with legal requirements. We will share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to a valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena. We also will also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.
* Other parties with your consent. We may share information about you with third parties when you consent to such sharing.

**6\. Cookies** 

We or our third party partners may store some information on your device or device hard drive as a "cookie" or similar type of file (such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, and similar technologies that work on mobile devices) to collect data related to usage of these services and for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Website.

We use the following types of cookies on the Publisher Platform and Advertiser Dashboard:

* Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. 
* Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it (such as Google Analytics).
* Functionality cookies. These are used to recognize you when you return to our website (such as cookies dropped by Intercom). 

We currently do not directly collect personal data about Listeners through cookies. 

**7\. Opt-Outs.**

Opting out of cookies. If you want to stop or restrict the placement of cookies or flush any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to and adjust your web browser preferences. Further information on cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org. By deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our service or some of its functionality may be affected. 

Opting out of targeted advertising via Nielsen. We use data we receive from Nielsen to facilitate tailored advertising within your podcast listening experience. If you want Nielsen to stop providing us with your information, [please use Nielsen’s opt-out function](https://sites.nielsen.com/legal/privacy-statement/exelate-privacy-policy/opt-in-opt-out/). 

Please note that Nielsen’s opt-out function does not opt you out of tailored advertising entirely - it works independently and is unique to each browser on your devices and each IP address that you use to access podcasts. For instance, if you opt out of tailored advertising on your iPad at home but not on your iPhone at home, you may still receive tailored advertising while listening to podcasts on your iPhone. Relatedly, if you opt out on your iPad at home but then listen to podcasts from a different location, you may still receive tailored ads. 

Once you opt out, Nielsen will stop providing us with your data. It can take up to 30 days for our database to update your selection, during which you may still receive tailored advertising.

Promotional Communications. If you are a Publisher or Advertiser who has opted into receiving newsletters from us (which may include updates about new or improved products and features), you may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those messages or by contacting us at any time. If you opt out from promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

**8\. Data Security**

We are committed to protecting the personal data in our systems. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.

If you are a Publisher or Advertiser and have an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any access to or use of your account using your password, whether or not authorized by you.  Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.

**9\. Data Retention and Deletion**

We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify’s legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:

* maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
* making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
* complying with our legal obligations
* resolving disputes 

When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of information, the nature and length of our relationship with you, the impact on such relationship if data is deleted, mandatory retention periods provided by law or statute of limitations.  

**10\. International Transfers** 

Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data. 

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:

* make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
* help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live

**11\. Changes to this Policy**

We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in case of material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.  

**12\. Contact Us**
