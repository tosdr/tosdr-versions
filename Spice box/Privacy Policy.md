The following Company privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you, as a user of the Website and apps, about the types of information that Company may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of the Website and Apps. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which Company uses and discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information. Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. You can find the detail of the privacy policy via this link: [https://www.spicebox.ca/privacy-policy/](https://www.spicebox.ca/privacy-policy/)

Professor Maxwell’s 4D Science, Professor Maxwell’s 4D Chef, Professor Maxwell’s 4D Galaxy and Professor Maxwell's 4D Chemistry apps are intended for use by children, with parental participation and supervision. Please refer to the relevant sections in this policy for each. SpiceBox is committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) and the regulations of the Federal Trade Commission in the operation of our Apps.

BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEBSITE/APPs, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY

**COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

When you visit the Site, download our Android apps from Google Play as well as IOS apps on Apple Store, we collect certain information about your device, your interaction with the Site/App, and information necessary to process your purchases. We may also collect additional information if you contact us for customer support. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to any information that can uniquely identify an individual (including the information below) as “Personal Information”. See the list below for more information about what Personal Information we collect and why.

SpiceBox Product Development Ltd. does not collect personal information from children under the age of 13. We do not request that children provide us with personal information, and do not offer features that are intended to collect such information from children. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a member of the Website or has otherwise transferred Personally-Identifying Information to the website or app, please contact Company using our contact information below to have that child's account terminated and information deleted.

**Web Cookies**

A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you logged into the Website and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other Non- Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.

The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your device.

You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user experience and parts of our website may no longer be fully accessible.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can choose whether or not to accept cookies through your browser controls, often found in your browser’s “Tools” or “Preferences” menu. For more information on how to modify your browser settings or how to block, manage or filter cookies can be found in your browser’s help file or through such sites as [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://kenton12a.myshopify.com/admin/settings/www.allaboutcookies.org).

Additionally, please note that blocking cookies may not completely prevent how we share information with third parties such as our advertising partners. To exercise your rights or opt-out of certain uses of your information by these parties, please follow the instructions in the “Behavioural Advertising” section below.
