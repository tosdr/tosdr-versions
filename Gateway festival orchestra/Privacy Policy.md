###### **2.**      **Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

###### **How We Use Cookies**

###### Like many other companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels and web beacons) (collectively, “Cookies”). “Cookies” are small files of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer hard drive, mobile or other devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets).

###### We use Cookies to:

* ###### Estimate audience size and usage patterns;
    
* ###### Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions to resolve issues and offer better site experiences and tools in the future; and
    

###### We set some Cookies ourselves and others are set by other entities. We use Cookies set by other entities to provide us with useful information to help us improve our Site and Services, to conduct advertising, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising. For example, we use Cookies from Google and Facebook.  

###### **How You Can Opt-Out of Cookies**

###### _Browser Settings_

###### Cookies can be blocked by changing your Internet browser settings to refuse all or some Cookies. If you choose to block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Site.

###### _Advertising Industry Resources_

###### You can understand which entities have currently enabled Cookies for your browser or mobile device and how to opt-out of some of those Cookies by accessing the [Network Advertising Initiative’s website](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s website](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/). For more information on mobile specific opt-out choices, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Mobile Choices website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices).

###### Please note that these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised. Therefore, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.

###### **Google Analytics**

###### We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses Cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with the Site and Services, compile reports on their activity, and provide other services related to their activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a returning visitor, and any referring website. The technologies used by Google Analytics do not gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt-out of tracking of analytics by Google, click [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

###### **Google reCAPTCHA**

###### We use Google reCAPTCHA, a free service provided by Google, Inc., to protect our Site from spam and abuse. Google reCAPTCHA uses advanced risk analysis techniques to decipher humans and bots. Google reCAPTCHA works differently depending on what version is deployed. For example, you may be asked to check a box indicating that you are not a robot or Google reCAPTCHA may detect abusive traffic without user interaction. Google reCAPTCHA works by transmitting certain types of information to Google, such as the referrer URL, IP address, visitor behavior, operating system information, browser and length of the visit, cookies, and mouse movements. Your use of Google reCAPTCHA is subject to Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Use](https://policies.google.com/terms). More information as to Google reCAPTCHA and how it works is available [here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha).

###### **3.**      **Third Party Processors**

###### To ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate procedures with the service providers we share it with to ensure that it is treated consistent with applicable data security and privacy laws.  For example, we use PayPal as a payment processor.

###### **4.**       **“Do Not Track” Signals**

###### Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, the Site does not currently interpret, respond to or alter its practices when it receives “Do Not Track” signals.

###### **5.**      **Choices About Your Personally Identifiable Information**

###### **Review and Request Changes to Your Personally Identifiable Information**

###### To review or request changes to any of your Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us at [info@gatewayfestivalorchestra.org](mailto:info@gatewayfestivalorchestra.org).

###### **6.**      **Security**

###### We maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personally Identifiable Information we collect and store from loss, misuse, destruction, or unauthorized access.  However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.  Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

###### **7.**      **Third Party Links**

###### The Site may contain links that will let you leave the Site and access another website. Linked websites are not under our control.
