TERMS OF SALE
=============

**1\. SCOPE**

The information set out in the Terms of Sale and the detail contained on this webstore do not constitute an offer for sale but rather an invitation to treat. No contract in respect of any Products shall exist between you and us until your order has been accepted by us. If we do not accept your offer and funds have already been deducted from your account, these will be refunded.

**3\. PRICE AND TERMS OF PAYMENT**

While we take care to ensure that all prices quoted on our webstore are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any Product(s) you have ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming the order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, the order will be treated as cancelled and if you have already paid for the Product(s) you will receive a full refund.

We are under no obligation to sell the Product(s) to you at the incorrect (lower) price (even after we have sent you an Order Confirmation) if the pricing error is an obvious typographical or arithmetical inaccuracy and could have reasonably been recognized by you as such.

We reserve the right to decline orders for bulk or high value purchases and to change price and availability information without notice.

We reserve the right, at any time before our acceptance, to notify you of: (i) any revision in the prices of the Products to factor in any changes to the cost of the Products. Such changes include without limitation changes to the tax rate or levy and any variation in the applicable exchange rates; and/or (ii) any changes to the description of the Products. If you choose to continue with the fulfilment of your order, you acknowledge and agree that the Product will be sold to you in accordance with such revised price and/or description.

The countries in which we can deliver the Products are set out in the Corsair webstore. We reserve the right to amend this list of countries at any time and shall not be liable to you for any such amendment to the list of countries or the imposition of any new condition in relation to any country: [List of countries](https://help.corsair.com/hc/articles/360036286771-What-addresses-can-Corsair-ship-to-)

Unless stated otherwise, all prices of the Products set out on the Corsair webstore shall be exclusive of: (i) any shipping cost (unless you qualify for free shipping based on the terms set out on the Corsair webstore); (ii) any sales tax or duty, customs charge (including but not limited to customs charges), import duty and tax (where applicable); and (iii) cross border Fees (collectively, the "Additional Cost"). Such Additional Cost shall be borne by you.

Payment in full must be made before our acceptance using the payment methods as provided for on the Corsair webstore. Payment methods include major credit cards, AmazonPay and Paypal in select regions. We will charge credit and debit cards before dispatch of the Products or the commencement of any services.

You may not deduct from any payment by way of counterclaim or set-off without our prior written consent. We shall not be liable for any billing errors unless you advise us of such billing error within fifteen (15) working days from the date of acceptance. In the event such billing error is attributable solely to us, we will cancel your order and/or refund any prior payment that you have made for that Product. We will also allow a re-order of that Product.

**5\. SOFTWARE**

All software (including pre-loaded software contained in hardware) is provided subject to such software's end user license agreement. You agree that you shall be bound to such end user license agreement.

**6\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

IN NO EVENT SHALL CORSAIR, THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SALE, EVEN IF CORSAIR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL CORSAIRâ€™S AGGREGATE LIABILITY (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO YOUR DAMAGES. The foregoing limitations will apply even if any warranty or remedy provided under this Agreement fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other limitations set forth above, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and to the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall have no liability to you if the Products infringe or are alleged to infringe any rights (including intellectual property rights) of any third party.

**7\. LICENSES & EXPORT LAWS**

You are responsible for obtaining (at your own expense) any license or consent from any government authority (or any other authority) that is required for the purchase, transport or use of the Products. You agree to provide evidence of such license or consent upon our request.

You agree to comply with any export control laws or regulations that are applicable to the purchase, transport or use of the Products.

**8\. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS**

You shall maintain and promptly update your account information that is stored with us and shall secure such information (including but not limited to your username and password) against any unauthorized access.

You represent to us that all information provided by you when placing your Order is up to date and is sufficient for us to process your Order.

You shall not assume any warranty, commitment or obligation on our behalf without our express prior written consent.

**9\. PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PRIVACY POLICY**

When you make an offer to purchase a Product, we will collect or receive your Personal Information or non-identifying information (as those terms are defined in our Privacy Policy, available at [www.corsair.com/s/privacy-policy](https://www.corsair.com/s/privacy-policy)).
