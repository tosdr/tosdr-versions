### 12A. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT – UNITED STATES USERS

IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SECTION 12A OF THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW DISPUTES THAT YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEVE AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12B BELOW.

IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE US, THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12C BELOW.

ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE AGREEMENT.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires users to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with FaceApp and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Except for small claims disputes in which you or FaceApp seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or FaceApp seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and FaceApp waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

Arbitration Rules and Forum. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to [\[email protected\]](https://faceapp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The arbitration will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under 250,000 EURO, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/](https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/). JAMS’s rules are also available at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, FaceApp will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than 10,000 Euro unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and FaceApp. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND FACEAPP HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and FaceApp are instead electing that all disputes, claims or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the courts of the Republic of Cyprus. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.

30-Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: [\[email protected\]](https://faceapp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

You and FaceApp agree that the courts of the Republic of Cyprus have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

Severability. Except as provided in this Section 12A, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with FaceApp.

Modification,Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if FaceApp makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing FaceApp at the following address: [\[email protected\]](https://faceapp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
