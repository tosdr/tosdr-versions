12\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
-----------------------

### 12A. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT - UNITED STATES USERS

IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SECTION 12A OF THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW DISPUTES THAT YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12B BELOW.

IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE US, THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12C BELOW.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires users to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with FaceApp and limits the way you can seek relief from us.

**Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** Except for small claims disputes in which you or FaceApp seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or FaceApp seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and FaceApp waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court. You and FaceApp are instead electing that all disputes, claims or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, however, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

**Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Resolution Requirements.** You must notify us in writing within one (1) year of any dispute arising under this Agreement in the form of a Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice shall be submitted via e-mail to [\[email protected\]](https://faceapp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), or you will waive your right to bring these claims in arbitration or small claims court. **The Notice you submit must be on your behalf only and must bear your signature, not the signature of your attorney. The Notice cannot be co-signed by another party or otherwise combined with the Notice of another party. The Notice must include your full name, physical address, email address, and phone number and describe with sufficient detail to allow FaceApp to investigate and evaluate: (a) your relationship with FaceApp; (b) the claims or dispute that you are asserting; (c) the facts supporting your allegations; and (d) a statement of the specific relief sought.** Within sixty (60) days from receipt of the Notice, FaceApp may request a conference via telephone or videoconference aimed at resolving the dispute. Both parties must work in good faith to schedule a mutually agreeable time for the conference, which may take place after the sixty (60) day period. You and a representative from FaceApp must participate in the conference personally, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Both parties’ legal representation, if any, may join the conference. You must allow until the later of (1) sixty (60) days from receipt of the Notice or (2) the date of completion of any conference, if requested, for you and FaceApp to try to resolve the dispute before you may proceed to make a demand for arbitration or file a case in small claims court. **While you and FaceApp attempt to resolve the dispute, your claims shall be tolled. Tolling will end on the later of (1) sixty (60) days from the receipt of the Notice or (2) the date when any conference, if requested, has been completed.** Unless otherwise required by law, no arbitration may be accepted or administered, and no fees may be assessed or demanded, until these mandatory pre-arbitration resolution requirements are met. If an arbitration has been commenced before these mandatory pre-arbitration resolution requirements are met, then it must be dismissed.

**Arbitration Rules and Forum.** If you and FaceApp do not resolve the dispute within the tolling period and you choose to make a demand for arbitration, then the arbitration will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims or requests for relief equal to or greater than 250,000 EURO (€ 250,000), not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, which are available at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims or requests for relief less than 250,000 EURO (€ 250,000), not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, which are available at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or conducted in person in the county where you live or at another agreed location. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, then the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.

**Mass Arbitration.** If 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are filed against the same party or related parties by individual claimants represented by either the same law firm or law firms acting in coordination, then those demands for arbitration shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Mass Arbitration Rules and Procedures, which are available at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. Counsel for FaceApp and counsel for the claimants shall each select fifteen (15) arbitration proceedings to proceed in arbitration as bellwether proceedings to promote efficiency and cost savings for the parties. The remaining arbitration proceedings shall be stayed pending the outcome of the bellwether proceedings. If following the bellwether proceedings any claims remain and have not been withdrawn or otherwise resolved, then the results of the bellwether proceedings shall be given to a mediator whom the parties jointly select. The mediator shall conduct a global mediation so that the parties may attempt to resolve all remaining arbitration proceedings. If the global mediation is unsuccessful, then the parties shall each select another thirty (30) claims to proceed as bellwether proceedings to promote efficiency and cost savings for the parties. The remaining arbitration proceedings shall be stayed pending the outcome of the bellwether proceedings. If following the bellwether proceedings any claims remain and have not been withdrawn or otherwise resolved, then the results of the bellwether proceedings shall be given to a mediator whom the parties jointly select. The mediator shall conduct a second global mediation so that the parties may attempt to resolve all remaining arbitration proceedings. If the second global mediation is unsuccessful, then the remaining arbitration proceedings may proceed. If the parties reach a global settlement, then claimants may opt out of the settlement and proceed with their individual arbitration proceedings or assert claims in small claims court, if eligible. **If FaceApp makes a settlement offer to you as part of a global mediation, before you may proceed with your individual arbitration proceeding, you (directly or through your counsel) shall certify in a writing bearing your signature that you personally received and were made aware of the offer and any counterclaims including for fees and costs that FaceApp may bring should you proceed with your individual arbitration and that you had the opportunity to review and discuss the offer and the risk of counterclaims with counsel before rejecting the offer.**

**Authority of the Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and FaceApp. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.

**Arbitration Fees.** Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by JAMS’s rules. **If you bring an arbitration proceeding with claims substantially similar to those that failed and/or were rejected in a previous arbitration proceeding, you (including your attorney(s)) knew or reasonably should have known that the claims were previously unsuccessful, and you did not raise unique legal or factual allegations that were not frivolous, then you (including your attorney(s)) shall reimburse FaceApp for all of FaceApp’s arbitration costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, unless you demonstrate that you are unable to afford those costs and fees.**

**Arbitration Award.** Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The courts of the Republic of Cyprus shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an award.

**30-Day Right to Opt-Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: [\[email protected\]](https://faceapp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. The notice you submit must be on your behalf only and must bear your signature. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, then all other parts of this Agreement shall continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

**Severability.** **Except as provided in the “Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief” subsection below, if an arbitrator or court decides that any term or provision of this section is invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intent of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision and this section shall be enforceable as so modified.**

**Survival of Agreement.** This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your relationship with FaceApp and/or the expiration, termination or rescission of the Agreement.

**Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if FaceApp makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement you may reject that change within fourteen (14) days of such change becoming effective by sending written notice of your decision to reject the change to: [\[email protected\]](https://faceapp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Your notice must include your name and address and an unequivocal statement that you reject the change to this Arbitration Agreement. The notice you submit must be on your behalf only and must bear your signature.

**Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND FACEAPP HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

**Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.** ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, MUST BE BROUGHT IN EACH PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) IS AVAILABLE. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR LITIGATE ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS; AND YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim or request for relief, then such aspect of the dispute, claim or request for relief must be severed and brought in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus.

### 12B. DISPUTE RESOLUTION - EU AND UK USERS

If you live outside of the Republic of Cyprus, but within the EU or the UK, then both you and FaceApp can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Services or this Agreement in either your local courts or the courts of the Republic of Cyprus.

### 12C. DISPUTE RESOLUTION - OTHER JURISDICTIONS

In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.

Subject to this Agreement, FaceApp hereby grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to (a) install the Apps on one mobile device at a given time and (b) use the Apps for your own personal use solely to access and use the Services. To be clear, if you choose to replace your device for use, the foregoing does not prevent you from installing the Apps on a new device on which you also have agreed to this Agreement, but this may be prohibited or restricted under the terms of the Distribution Channels (as defined below). Each instance of the Agreement that you agree to in connection with downloading the Apps grants you the aforementioned rights in connection with the installation and use of the Apps on one device.

The technology and software underlying the Services or distributed in connection therewith are the property of FaceApp, its affiliates, and its licensors (including the Apps, collectively, the “Software”). You agree not to copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or to sell, assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer any right in the Software. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by FaceApp.

We offer Software that may be made available through the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, or other distribution channels (“Distribution Channels”). If you obtain such Software through a Distribution Channel, you may be subject to additional terms of the Distribution Channel. This Agreement is between you and us only, and not with the Distribution Channels. To the extent that you utilize any other third-party products and services in connection with your use of the Services, you agree to comply with all applicable terms of any agreement for such third-party products and services.

The parties acknowledge that to the extent that there are any applicable warranties, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any such applicable warranty would be the sole responsibility of FaceApp. However, you understand and agree that in accordance with this Agreement, FaceApp has disclaimed all warranties of any kind with respect to the Apps, and therefore, there are no warranties applicable to the Apps.

* **Legal Compliance.** You represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
* **Developer Name and Address.** Any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Apps should be directed to: FaceApp Technology Limited, 28th October Ave 319a, 8th Floor - Office 801A, Limassol, 3105, Cyprus, [\[email protected\]](https://faceapp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

When you access, purchase or download the Apps from Google Play, you acknowledge and agree that:

* To the extent that this Agreement conflicts with the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement, the Google Play Terms of Service or the terms and guidelines that govern your use of Google Play, such terms will prevail with respect to your use of the Apps that you access, purchase or download from Google Play.
