1\. Our Services
----------------

BeePass is a virtual-private-network service that helps you to more safely access the open internet and improve your online privacy. You may receive BeePass VPN servers from our BeePass Email Bot or BeePass Telegram Bot. We may also provide you with support services through social media channels and our helpdesk system, using Zammad, the web-based, open source user support/ticketing solution. Unless expressly stated otherwise, this Agreement applies to all services provided by BeePass, including the helpdesk system, and any other services we may provide through BeePass or our website.

BeePass is constantly working on improving our various Services. We reserve the right to add or remove functionalities or features to improve our Services, and we may suspend or stop Services, temporarily or permanently, or restrict or prohibit access to the Services or parts thereof, without notice to you. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of such Services. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to correct any errors or omissions in any portion of the Services at any time without notice, but confirm that we have no obligation to do so.

2\. Registration, Account and Password
--------------------------------------

You do not need to register an account to use our Services. We provide two automated systems for our users to get Access Keys to connect to our servers:

* BeePass Email Bot

### BeePass Email Bot

Users can send a blank email to [get@beepassvpn.com](mailto:get@beepassvpn.com) and automatically receive an email with an access key for a new BeePass VPN server. We will occasionally send users emails regarding the latest BeePass VPN updates and changes to our systems.

You can opt-out at any time by finding the unsubscribe button at the bottom of each email you receive from BeePass Email Bot. Please note that once you opt-out we’re not able to send you new BeePass VPN servers, and your key will be removed from our system immediately. There will be a 7-day period before your information is completely removed from our systems.

### BeePass Telegram Bot

Users can get BeePass VPN servers from our Telegram Bot. When you use the BeePass Telegram Bot, you will receive an automated response with an access key for a new BeePass VPN server. We may provide timely update notification to users regarding BeePass VPN servers.

You can opt-out from the distribution list at any time by going to BeePass Telegram Bot and pressing the **Delete Account** button. Please note that once you opt-out, we will not be able to send you new BeePass VPN servers and your key will be removed from our system immediately. There will be a 7 day period before your information is completely removed from our systems.
