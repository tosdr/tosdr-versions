BeePass Default Server
----------------------

When using the default server we can’t guarantee that all information about your internet traffic will be fully private. When connecting to a website using TLS (https) the content you are sending and receiving will be encrypted, however the domain name of the website you are connecting to could be seen by someone with FULL access to your network, like your internet service provider since they can connect to BeePass and access the same key your device will use to encrypt your requests. When connecting to a website not using TLS (http) the full content you are sending and receiving **could** be seen by someone with FULL access to your network.

By using the default server you acknowledge this risk. If you’re concerned we recommend requesting a different server from our Telegram or email bot.

-------------------------------

We keep the personal information we collect about you confidential in accordance with this Policy and have adopted reasonable physical, technical and organizational procedures appropriate to the sensitivity of the data to safeguard the personal information you provide to us. Notwithstanding these measures, no collection, storage or transmission of information over the Internet on websites or otherwise can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore we cannot ensure, warrant or guarantee the security of any such information.
