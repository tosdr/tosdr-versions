        Â 
    2. While a force majeure event subsists, the Party so affected shall be relieved of liability to the other for failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement and such obligations shall be suspended until such time as performance can be resumed (provided that the relevant affected Party could not have prevented the failure or delay by taking reasonable precautions or measures).

        Â

Once the 400 STPs are reached in a month, further visits to the Customer Website will not be analysed and the representations on the Platform Dashboard may be incomplete for that month. In the following month, Customer can then use the Services again to the extent of the Free Basic Version until the 400 STPs are reached.

        Available Premium Plans can be found at: [https://www.twipla.com/en/pricing](https://www.visitor-analytics.io/en/pricing)  
          
        Customerâs subscription will automatically renew at the day of the new calendar month/calendar year equivalent to the day on which the Agreement was concluded. The fees will be charged each month/each year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of the Agreement. (See Section 6.b)  
          
        If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and Customer does not change Customerâs payment method or cancel Customerâs account, TWIPLA may suspend Customerâs access to the Service until TWIPLA has obtained a valid payment method. When Customer updates Customerâs payment method, Customer authorizes us to continue charging the updated payment method, and Customer remains responsible for any uncollected amounts. Section 6.dÂ of these Terms of Service shall remain unaffected.

Except as set forth in this section or to the extent expressly agreed to in writing between Customer and TWIPLA, the Agreement constitutes all of the terms and conditions agreed to between Customer and TWIPLA and supersedes all prior agreements with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Service, whether written or oral.  
        Â 
    2. Customer shall note, however, that certain aspects of the use of the TWIPLA Services and its Visitor Recordings feature (if ordered) may be governed by additional agreements. This may include, for example, access to the TWIPLA Service through a gift voucher or use in conjunction with other services. If Customer is offered such use, Customer will be presented with a respective supplemental agreement, and Customer may have the opportunity to agree to additional terms. Some of these additional terms are set forth on the TWIPLA Website. To the extent there is an irreconcilable conflict between additional terms and these Terms of Service, the additional terms will prevail.

**Appendix 1**

1. **Service Levels**  
    Â 
    1. The Service Levels for the Platform and other available features of the Services are defined as follows:  
          
        System availability of the Platform per month \[average availability\].
        
        |     |     |
        | --- | --- |
        | Service level | 99.75% availability |
        | Calculation | The availability is calculated as follows:<br><br>"Availability" means the ability of Customer to access the features of theÂ   <br>Platform as agreed in the Agreement.  <br>  <br>"Scheduled Downtime" means the total time (in minutes) in a calendar year  <br>that the Platform is unavailable due to Scheduled System Maintenance or  <br>other Scheduled Downtime. TWIPLA will use reasonable efforts to  <br>ensure that Scheduled System Maintenance occurs between 1:00 a.m. and  <br>5:00 a.m. CEST and that reasonable notice of such System Maintenance  <br>is given.  <br>  <br>"System Availability" relative to availability in a calendar year is the ratio  <br>expressed as a percentage when Customer subtracts the unscheduled  <br>downtime in that calendar year from the annual total time in that year and  <br>then divides that difference by the annual total time in that year (see formula  <br>above).  <br>  <br>"Total Annual Time" includes all minutes in the applicable calendar year during  <br>the term of the Agreement.  <br>  <br>"Unscheduled Downtime" means the total time (in minutes) of unavailability  <br>in a calendar year, excluding Planned Downtime and excluding Downtime that  <br>occurs due to circumstances beyond TWIPLA's control. Such circumstances  <br>include, without limitation,  <br>(i) Customer's breach of the terms of this Agreement,  <br>(ii) Customer's failure to comply with the terms of this SLA,  <br>(iii) incompatibility of Customer's hardware or software with the agreed requirements  <br>relating to use of the Services, including the requirements set forth in the Access Protocols,  <br>(iv) poor or inadequate performance of the Systems or Customer,  <br>(v) Customer's use ofÂ the Services significantly in excess of the agreed volume, or  <br>(vi) Force MajeureÂ (as defined in the Agreement). |
        | Measuring point | TWIPLA Service - Delivery point for the Platform and/or other available  <br>functionality for the Services. |
        | Measuring time | Calendar month during the Term of the SaaS Contract |
        
    2. TWIPLA provides daily email support, 8 hours a day, worldwide. Email support can be reached at [support@twipla.com](mailto:support@twipla.com).  
        Â 
2. **Rights in the event of non-compliance with the Service Levels**  
    Â 
    1. In the event of **Unscheduled Downtime,** TWIPLA agrees to use economically reasonable efforts to remedy the Unscheduled Downtime within a reasonable time period.  
        Â 
    2. If TWIPLA fails to meet the Service Levels set forth in Appendix 1 'Service Levels', Customer shall be entitled to the service credits set forth below ("**Credits**"), provided that Credits for Unscheduled Downtime shall not exceed 5% of the total charges paid by Customer to TWIPLA for all Services provided during the applicable Service Month.  
        Â 
        
        |     |     |
        | --- | --- |
        | Availability of services | Credit (% of the monthly fees for the services) |
        | < 99.0% | 2.5% |
        | < 98.0% | 5.0% |
        | < 97.0% | 10.0% |
        
    3. Receipt of Credits. In order to receive a credit, Customer must request such credit in writing from TWIPLA within five (5) business days of receipt of a report describing the Unscheduled Downtime ("**Service Level Report**") for the period for which the credit is alleged to have occurred. Customer's written request must detail the date(s), time(s), and duration(s) of any Unscheduled Downtime claimed by Customer. If TWIPLA approves Customer's written request for a credit after review, TWIPLA will notify Customer of this fact and how to receive the credit. Credits cannot be applied retroactively. Any Customer who fails to timely submit a written request for a credit will forfeit all rights to receive a credit for that month. Credits payable by TWIPLA will be credited against any claim for damages Customer may have under the Agreement based on such Service Level violation.  
        Â 
    4. Customer must notify TWIPLA immediately if any Unscheduled Downtime occurs. Unscheduled Downtime shall be deemed to have occurred when TWIPLA receives sufficient notice to that effect from Customer or when TWIPLA first becomes aware of such Unscheduled Downtime, whichever occurs first.
