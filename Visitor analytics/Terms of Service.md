Details are contained in the data processing Contract concluded between the parties ([https://www.twipla.com/en/support/legal-data-privacy-certificates/twipla-website/privacy-policy](https://www.visitor-analytics.io/en/support/legal-data-privacy-certificates/twipla-website/privacy-policy); "**DPA**").  
        Â 
12. **Defects**  
      
    If and insofar as the contract is to be qualified as a contract for work and services or a rental contract, the customer has the statutory rights in the event of a defect. The following applies to Premium Editions: The right to a reduction in the subscription fee is excluded, with the exception of reductions in the form of credit notes in accordance with Annex 1, Section 2 "Rights in the event of non-compliance with the service levels".  
    The free basic version is provided "as is" with certain downtimes. TWIPLA does not promise any specific service levels as part of the Free Basic Version. TWIPLA shall use its best efforts to minimize downtime when using the Free Basic Version. TWIPLA excludes any warranty for the Free Basic Version and shall only be liable for fraudulently concealed defects. The service levels listed below in Annex 1 Service Levels shall not apply.  
    Â 
13. **Limitation of liability**  
    Â 
    1. Limitation of liability  
          
        TWIPLA's liability for damages caused by slight negligence, regardless of the legal grounds, shall be limited as follows:  
        Â 
        1. For each case of damage, TWIPLA shall be liable for annual subscriptions up to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage, which the parties shall set at a maximum of the amount of the annual fee volume, and for monthly subscriptions up to the amount of the monthly fee.
        2. TWIPLA shall not be liable for slightly negligent breach of any other applicable duty of care.  
            Â 
    2. Unlimited liability  
          
        The above limitations of liability shall not apply to mandatory statutory liability and liability for culpably caused personal injury. Furthermore, these limitations of liability shall not apply if and insofar as TWIPLA has assumed a special guarantee.  
        Â 
    3. Damage minimization  
          
        The customer is obliged to take appropriate measures to avert and minimize damage.  
        Â 
14. **Force majeure**  
    Â 
    1. Cases of force majeure  
          
        Neither party shall be liable to the other party for any failure to perform (in whole or in part) or for any delay or failure in performance to the extent that such delay or failure is caused by a force majeure event, such force majeure being external, unforeseeable events, an absolutely insurmountable and unavoidable event such as an earthquake, volcanic eruption, storm, tsunami, flood, fire, typhoon, pandemic, war, terrorist attack or national crisis, unless these disasters are a common phenomenon in the territory in which the contracting party is located.  
        Â 
    2. Consequences  
          
        For so long as a Force Majeure Event continues, the affected party shall be relieved from liability to the other party for failure to perform its obligations under the Contract and the contractual obligations of both parties shall be suspended until performance can be resumed (provided that the affected party could not have prevented the failure or delay by reasonable precautions or measures). The affected party shall immediately notify the other party as soon as it becomes aware that it is unable to perform under this Contract as a result of a Force Majeure Event.  
        Â 
    3. Right of termination  
          
        If a force majeure event lasts longer than one (1) consecutive month, either party may terminate the contract with four (4) weeks' notice.  
        Â 
15. **Choice of law and place of jurisdiction**  
    Â 
    1. Choice of law  
          
        The contract shall be governed exclusively by the law of the country in which TWIPLA has its registered office, excluding conflict of laws principles and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  
        Â 
    2. Place of jurisdiction  
        The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract shall be the competent court at TWIPLA's registered office.  
        Â 
16. **Other provisions**  
    Â 
    1. Invalid regulations  
          
        Should any provision of this contract be or become invalid in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.  
        Â 
    2. General terms and conditions of the customer  
          
        General terms and conditions provided by the customer as part of an order, invoice or purchase order shall not apply and are hereby rejected by TWIPLA.  
        Â 
    3. Use of subcontractors  
          
        TWIPLA may commission subcontractors to provide the contractually agreed services. In this case, TWIPLA shall be responsible for ensuring the proper performance of these subcontractors in accordance with the Terms of Service. Provisions in the DPA shall remain unaffected by this.  
        Â 
    4. Compliance with laws  
          
        Each party agrees to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the performance of its obligations under the Contract.  
        Â 
    5. Complete Contract  
          
        Except as stated in this section or as expressly agreed in writing between the Customer and TWIPLA, the Contract constitutes all terms and conditions agreed between the Customer and TWIPLA and supersedes all prior Contracts, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of these Terms.  
        Â 
    6. Possible additional Contract  
          
        The customer shall note that certain aspects of the use of the TWIPLA Services and their Visitor Recordings function (if ordered) may be governed by additional Contracts. This may be the case, for example, in the case of access to the TWIPLA Service via a gift voucher or by using it together with other services. If an offer for such use is made to the customer, a corresponding additional Contract shall be presented to the customer and the customer may have the opportunity to agree to additional terms and conditions. Some of these additional terms are listed on TWIPLA's website. To the extent that there is an irreconcilable conflict between additional terms and these Terms of Service, the additional terms shall prevail.  
        Â 

**Annex 1 to the TWIPLA Service Contract - Service Levels**

1. Service level description  
    Â 
    1. The service levels of the platform and other available functions are defined as follows:  
        Â 
        
        |     |     |
        | --- | --- |
        | System availability of the platform per month \[average availability\] |     |
        | Service level | 99.75% availability |
        | Calculation | Availability is calculated as follows:<br><br>System availability (%) = (Annual total time - Unplanned downtime)/Annual total time<br><br>"Availability" is the customer's ability to access the functions of the platform as agreed in the contract.<br><br>"Scheduled Downtime" means the total time (in minutes) in a calendar year during which the Platform is unavailable due to scheduled system maintenance or other scheduled downtime. TWIPLA shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the scheduled system maintenance takes place between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. CEST and that such system maintenance is announced in a reasonable time.<br><br>The "system availability" in relation to the availability in a calendar year is the ratio expressed as a percentage when the customer subtracts the unplanned downtime in that calendar year from the total annual downtime in that year and then divides this difference by the total annual downtime in that year (see formula above).<br><br>"Total annual time" includes all minutes of the relevant calendar year during the term of the contract.<br><br>"Unplanned Downtime" means the total time (in minutes) of unavailability in a calendar year excluding planned downtime and downtime caused by circumstances beyond TWIPLA's control. Such circumstances include, without limitation, (i) breaches of the terms of this Contract by the Customer, (ii) non-compliance by the Customer with the terms of this SLA, (iii) incompatibility of the Customer's hardware or software with the agreed requirements relating to the use of the Services, including the requirements set out in the Access Protocols, (iv) poor or inadequate performance of the Systems or the Customer, (v) use of the Services by the Customer that significantly exceeds the agreed volume, or (vi) Force Majeure (as defined in the Contract). |
        | Measuring point | TWIPLA Service - handover point for the platform and/or other available functions for the Services |
        | Timekeeping | calendar year during the term of the contract |
        
          
        Â 
    2. Support  
          
        TWIPLA offers worldwide support by e-mail. Email support can be reached at [support@twipla.com](mailto:support@twipla.com). We endeavor to respond to your request within 48 hours on weekdays.  
        Â 
2. **Rights in the event of non-compliance with the service levels**  
    Â 
    1. Unplanned downtime  
          
        In the event of an **Unplanned Downtime,** Visitors Analytics undertakes to use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the Unplanned Downtime within a reasonable period of time.  
        Â 
    2. Credits  
          
        If TWIPLA fails to meet the service levels set out in Annex 1 - Service Levels, the customer shall be entitled to the service credits listed below ("**Credits**"), whereby the Credits for Unplanned Downtime shall not exceed 5% of the total costs for all ordered Services paid by the customer to TWIPLA for all Services provided in the respective Service Month. The entitlement to a credit note of 10.0% of the monthly fees in the event that the availability of individual services is not met shall remain unaffected by this.  
        Â 
        
        |     |     |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Availability of services** | **Credit (% of the monthly fees for the service)** |
        | < 99.0% | 2.5% |
        | < 98.0% | 5.0% |
        | < 97.0% | 10.0% |
        
          
        Â 
    3. Service level report  
          
        Receipt of Credits. In order to receive a credit, the Customer must submit a written request to TWIPLA within five (5) business days of receipt of a report describing the Unplanned Downtime ("**Service Level Report**") for the period for which the credit is claimed to have been incurred. The Customer's written request shall specify the date(s), time(s) and duration(s) of each Unplanned Downtime claimed by the Customer. If TWIPLA approves the customer's written request for a credit after review, TWIPLA shall inform the customer of this fact and how the customer will receive the credit. Credit notes cannot be applied retroactively. Any customer who fails to submit a timely written request for a credit note shall lose all rights to receive a credit note for the month in question. Credits payable by TWIPLA shall be applied to any claim for damages that the customer may assert under the Contract as a result of such breach of service level.  
        Â 
    4. Customer's obligation to notify  
          
        The customer shall notify TWIPLA immediately if an Unplanned Downtime occurs. Unplanned Downtime shall be deemed to have occurred when TWIPLA receives sufficient notice thereof from the customer or when TWIPLA first becomes aware of such Unplanned Downtime, whichever occurs first.
