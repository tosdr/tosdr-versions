ðŸŒˆ About Me
-----------

Hello, I'm Connor Slade. Welcome to my little place on the internet, [connorcode.com](https://connorcode.com/) _version 7.1.0_!  
  
I'm interested in [Photography](https://photos.connorcode.com/), [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/), [Software development](https://github.connorcode.com/) and some Web development. My favorite The Best programming language is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)! Like just look at the cute [mascot](https://rustacean.dev/ ":ferris:"). I use it for most of my projects. In fact, I'm hosting this site with Rust and my own dependency free web server framework [afire](https://crates.io/crates/afire).  
  
I started my _programming journey_ around 2014 with the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). Then I learned how to make basic websites with HTML and CSS, then how to make them interactive with JavaScript. After that, I got into Python and eventually started to learn much more about Linux, Docker, different programming languages. After trying NodeJS, Nim, Assembly, C#, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Lua and many more I eventually settled on _Rust_ for most of my projects.
