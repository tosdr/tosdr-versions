Terms of Service
================

The Trevor Project (“**The Trevor Project**” or “**we**” or “**us**” or “**our**”) is a 501c3 nonprofit organization with a charitable mission of ending suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) young people. We carry out our mission through providing suicide prevention and crisis intervention services for LGBTQ youth and serving as a leading voice in education, advocacy, and research relating to LGBTQ youth and mental health.

We offer programs and services to LGBTQ youth that create safe, accepting, and inclusive environments (i) within this website at TheTrevorProject.org (this “**Website**”) and (ii) by providing crisis counseling over the phone, online, and through text (collectively and individually, our “**Crisis Services**”).

Crisis Services Terms
---------------------

(for [Crisis Services](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-help/))

**IF YOU ARE IN DANGER OR BELIEVE YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY, OR VISIT THE NEAREST HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.** 

The Trevor Project offers certain crisis services to LGBTQ youth to create safe, accepting, and inclusive environments by offering crisis counseling over the phone, online, and through text (collectively and individually, “**Crisis Services**”).  BY USING OUR CRISIS SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO THESE CRISIS SERVICES TERMS, THE [GENERAL LEGAL TERMS](#general-legal-terms), AND THE [PRIVACY POLICY](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/privacy-policy/), AND YOU CERTIFY THAT YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. These Crisis Services Terms, [General Legal Terms](#general-legal-terms), and [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/privacy-policy/) govern (i) your access and use of Crisis Services and (ii) your use and receipt of information through our Crisis Services. 

Each time that you start a conversation with us via text, you will receive an automated message with a link to our Website, and a link to our Crisis Services Terms is also included in the pre-chat submission form for TrevorChat, so you may review them before continuing to use the Services; using Crisis Services after receiving this message will constitute your acceptance of the Terms then in effect.

### Description of Services 

The Trevor Project offers 24/7 life-saving, life-affirming programs and services to LGBTQ youth, including the following Crisis Services:

* **Lifeline**—The only national 24/7 crisis intervention and suicide prevention lifeline for LGBTQ young people under age 25, available at 1-866-488-7386.
* **Chat**—A 24/7 free instant messaging service for LGBTQ youth that provides live help from trained counselors, open daily. 
* **Text**—A 24/7 free service through which LGBTQ young people can text a trained counselor of The Trevor Project for support and crisis intervention, available daily by texting START to 678678. 

### No Professional Advice

The counseling made available through our Crisis Services cannot replace or substitute for the services of trained professionals in any field, including medical or legal matters. YOUR USE OF OUR CRISIS SERVICES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MENTAL HEALTHCARE OR TREATMENT AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A THERAPIST-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP OR ANY SIMILAR PRIVILEGED RELATIONSHIP. OUR CRISIS SERVICES ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARE, MENTAL HEALTHCARE TREATMENT, PSYCHIATRIC CARE, OR THERAPY OF ANY KIND. We do not assume any liability for any direct, indirect, consequential, special, exemplary, or other damages that may result from your use of our Crisis Services, including economic loss, injury, illness, or death.

Our Crisis Services are not intended for anyone in need of immediate medical services or in the case of a life-threatening emergency. **IF YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL YOUR DOCTOR OR 911 IMMEDIATELY, OR VISIT THE NEAREST HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.** 

### Risk of Using the Services

You assume all risk for your use of our Crisis Services. Neither The Trevor Project nor any of our employees, volunteers, or agents will be or is responsible for any decisions, or results of the decisions that you make while, as a result of, or after contacting us. This includes whether you choose to seek or not seek professional care, or to modify or terminate specific treatment that you are currently receiving based on the information provided by our Crisis Services.

### Artificial Intelligence

We may use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing (“**AI**”) in connection with our operation of Crisis Services. For instance, we may use AI as part of the Crisis Services intake process in order to determine the appropriate place for you in the queue if all of our counselors are occupied. We may also use AI for analysis during and after conversations in Crisis Services, such as for detecting conversation themes. While we will only use AI that we believe functions well, and we apply high ethical and anti-bias standards in our use of AI, we cannot control or predict the outcome of AI in any particular case. AI may not accurately predict your individual risk level and may not assign you to a place in the queue that reflects your particular case. Neither The Trevor Project nor any of our employees, volunteers, or agents will be or is responsible for any outcomes of AI. Note that we do not use AI as a substitute for trained counselors once you are connected with a counselor through our Crisis Services – our counselors are real people.

### Rules of Use

You agree to use Crisis Services only for lawful and legitimate purposes, in accordance with these Crisis Services Terms, subject to the following rules:

* DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL SERVICES.
* Please DO NOT start more than one chat or text session at a time. Please remember to conclude and close your chat or text conversation when it ends and make sure you are in a private area if needed.
* DO NOT prank call, chat, or text us. Our Crisis Services are available to young people who may be in crisis, and pranks take time away from your peers who may really need help. “Swatting” or making similar malicious prank calls, chats, or texts is illegal, and we may report this to the authorities.
* DO NOT embed material in chat or text messages using HTML, whether images, sound, or video.
* DO NOT send, in chat or text messages, any images, videos, or links to any other websites.
* DO NOT impersonate or attempt to impersonate another person, whether famous or otherwise. 
* DO NOT attempt to interfere with the proper working of The Trevor Project or the Crisis Services.
* DO NOT communicate with, or attempt to identify, seek out, or communicate with, our crisis counselors outside of our Crisis Services.
* DO NOT threaten, harass, or otherwise inappropriately abuse The Trevor Project, its employees, partners, agents, subcontractors, volunteers, or others.
* DO NOT use our Crisis Services for sexual gratification.
* DO NOT use our Crisis Services in any way that violates the law.
* DO NOT copy, adapt, decompile, reverse engineer, attempt to discover the source code of, or make a derivative work from our Crisis Services.

The Trevor Project reserves the right to terminate your access to Crisis Services at any time, for any reason, including for violating any of the rules above or any other term within these Crisis Services Terms. Conversations may be terminated immediately if, in the sole opinion of The Trevor Project or its employee, volunteer, or agent, any rules are violated. In addition, The Trevor Project may restrict the frequency of conversations or adjust your access if we determine that you would be better served by a different kind of support.

### Text Messaging

As part of our Crisis Services available via text, we offer the ability to communicate with you via text (SMS) messages through our dedicated short code program. To use our text Crisis Services, you must agree (or “opt-in”) to receiving the communications through our short code program. Your opt-in will apply only for the duration of a specific conversation.  

We will collect and use information through our Website only in the ways disclosed in these Crisis Services Terms. This statement applies solely to information collected in connection with the Crisis Services through the short code 678678, and cannot be extended to third-party websites. 

We do not sell mobile numbers or address material. We do not share your mobile number or any of the information you provide during your use of our Crisis Services with third parties, except as described in these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/privacy-policy/).

You may opt-in to our short code program via keyword, by texting “START” to 678678. Messages and data rates may apply. Message frequency may vary by user depending on the conversation. 

If you are waiting to speak to a counselor, you can cancel the short code program by texting “STOP,” “STOPALL,” “UNSUBSCRIBE,” “CANCEL,” “END,” or “QUIT” to 678678. After you send the message to us, we may send you a reply message to confirm that you no longer wish to receive related text messages from us. After this, you will only receive text messages from us if you opt in to rejoin the queue, or if we feel further texts are necessary for your health and safety.

If at any time you need technical support, forget what keywords are supported, or require assistance with our short code program, just text “HELP” to 678678. After you send the message “HELP” to us, we will respond with instructions on how to use our service as well as how to unsubscribe.

We may terminate or suspend your access to all or part of our short code program, without notice, for any conduct that is in violation of these Crisis Services Terms, or that we, in our sole discretion, believe is in violation of any applicable law or is harmful to the interests of any other person, other third-party entity, or our Crisis Services.

Participating carriers include AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Boost Mobile, MetroPCS, Virgin Mobile, Cricket, and most other carriers available in the United States. Participating carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages with respect to the short code program.

Alerts and messages sent via SMS may not be delivered to you if your phone is not in range of a transmission site, or if sufficient network capacity is not available at a particular time. Even within a coverage area, factors beyond the control of your wireless carrier may interfere with message delivery, including your equipment, terrain, proximity to buildings, foliage, and weather. You acknowledge that urgent alerts may not be timely received and that your wireless carrier does not guarantee that alerts or messages will be delivered.

### Technical Limitations

You understand and acknowledge that the Crisis Services may not be, and some are not, fully compatible with certain mobile devices, and you may experience technical issues with smartphones, tablets, and other devices. We would suggest you use Lifeline or text if you are contacting us from a mobile device, and only use our chat services from a computer because service interruptions on chat are more likely to occur when using chat from a mobile device.

### Privacy and Security

We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your Personal Information. These Crisis Services Terms must be read in conjunction with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/website-privacy-policy/), and the provisions of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/website-privacy-policy/) are incorporated into these Crisis Services Terms. To the extent these Crisis Services Terms conflict with the terms of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/website-privacy-policy/), the terms of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/privacy-policy/) will control.

### Disclosures to Third Parties

We are committed to the privacy of our users, and we will not share or disclose personal or sensitive information that we learn in the course of Crisis Services, other than as described in these Crisis Services Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/website-privacy-policy/). We value transparency and would like our users to understand how, when, and why their information may be shared, and would like to call attention to a few specific situations where personal or sensitive information may be disclosed (in addition to other permitted disclosures described in these Crisis Services Terms or Crisis Services [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/privacy-policy/)). 

Crisis Interventions. The Trevor Project cares deeply about the health and wellbeing of our community, and thus we make disclosures as needed to protect LGBTQ youth and others, and our policy is to alert law enforcement, state authorities, or emergency services if your communications with The Trevor Project indicate that you are at imminent risk of death or serious injury (i.e., if you have suicidal desire, a plan, access to means, and an imminent timeline).

Abuse and Imminent Threat Reports. If your communications indicate that a minor or vulnerable dependent adult has been or is currently being subjected to emotional or physical abuse or neglect, we may report this to the applicable state agency or other authority, which may include disclosing information relating to the particular situation, and may include personal or sensitive information you disclose to us. 

We may also make a report to an appropriate party, and make any disclosures we reasonably believe necessary, to prevent another person’s death or serious injury. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or in response to a subpoena that we reasonably believe is valid, we will not disclose personal or sensitive information to parents, legal guardians, or other individuals.

Our counselors are located in multiple states in the United States; while all of our counselors are trained, they are not working as licensed mental health workers and may not be trained in your state’s law. Other state laws may apply to your communications, and those state laws may not protect your communications to the same degree, or in the same way, as the laws of your state.

Research and Innovation. We may use information, including the content of conversations occurring within Crisis Services, to create, or permit a third-party researcher or partner to create, aggregate information, that does not include names or other personal identifiers, for the purpose of promoting suicide prevention research and the advancement of crisis intervention, and to produce statistics and metrics that will help us and others better understand and analyze the impact of our Crisis Services. We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information and any content of conversations occurring on the Service, with our partners, researchers, or third-parties for these purposes. We may also publicly publish the results of our research efforts, including statistics and metrics, such as in white papers and other research reports, and otherwise provide information about our innovation efforts and use of our services. Individual users will not be linked or identified by sharing this aggregate information.

Advocacy. We are passionate about saving LGBTQ lives, and our work involves various efforts, such as advocating for laws that protect LGBTQ youth from conversion therapy and advancing LGBTQ-inclusive suicide prevention policies in schools. The information we collect relating to our Crisis Services can be used as valuable evidence in supporting these efforts. We may use and disclose personal and sensitive information, in an anonymized form without using names or personally-identifying information, for these purposes, including using this information in amicus briefs, litigation, legislative testimony, and other activities.

Additional Disclosures. We may also disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you to third parties if we believe such disclosure is necessary: (i) to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process; (ii) to protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of The Trevor Project (including Crisis Services via phone, text, or chat), our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, volunteers, representatives, other related parties, or the individuals we serve; (iii) to enforce our Terms; (iv) in connection with a sale, merger, or corporate reorganization of The Trevor Project or our affiliates, or the transfer of any of our operations, including our Crisis Services, or (v) to address fraud, security (physical and cybersecurity), technical issues, or to operate the Crisis Services or its infrastructure systems properly.

### Internet Risks

We are committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and we take security measures to protect your information. However, no transmission or electronic storage of information is guaranteed to be secure. We therefore urge you to always use caution when transmitting information over the internet. Despite all of The Trevor Project’s security procedures, the internet is not a perfectly secure environment, and The Trevor Project cannot guarantee protection from intruders or interceptors. You agree that your use of, and any submission of information to, Crisis Services is at your own risk. You further agree that The Trevor Project has no liability regarding unauthorized access to Crisis Services.

### Your Information

Protecting Your Own Information. Always be careful and responsible regarding your own personally identifiable information. We are not responsible for, and cannot control, what others not affiliated with The Trevor Project do with information you provide to them. You may also choose to delete The Trevor Project conversations from your device, clear us from your history, and not save our number in your contact list to try to ensure that your relationship to The Trevor Project remains private.

Monitoring. Calls, chats, and texts to The Trevor Project’s Crisis Services may be monitored for training and quality assurance purposes.

Your Access to Information. Subject to applicable law and the [Privacy Policy](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/privacy-policy/), The Trevor Project may, but is not obligated to, provide you with access to any information from your account or call, chat, or text history within Crisis Services.

### Additional Terms

Any information that you share with a third-party provider in connection with your Donation to The Trevor Project will be subject to the terms of service and privacy policy of that third-party provider processing your Donation on The Trevor Project’s behalf.
