‍  
If you wish to contract Innovation Refunds to proceed, a consulting agreement and CPA engagement letter will be offered with further details, fees, and expectations. Innovation Refunds does not accept any project unless it determines your Company qualifies for the refunds.  
‍  
All the documentation is prepared so that your Company can apply the credits to past or current tax liability. Credits arrive in the form of a refund check. The credits may also be carried forward to offset tax liability in the future. If any credit we calculated is denied for any reason, Innovation Refunds will refund that portion of its fee.  
‍  
You certify that you have the required authority to sign and submit this questionnaire on behalf of the Applicant.  
‍  
You certify that the information provided in this questionnaire and in all supporting documentation true and correct in all material respects. You make this certification after reasonable inquiry people, systems, and other information available to the Applicant.

‍  
Your access and use of the website may be interrupted from time to time due to third party failures outside of our control (such as unavailability of general Internet infrastructure). Access and use may also be interrupted for periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the website. While we will make reasonable efforts to make the website available to you, we do not promise that it will be available at all times.
