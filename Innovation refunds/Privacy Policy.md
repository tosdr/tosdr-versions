Selling/Sharing
---------------

Although we do not disclose your personal information for any monetary consideration, our use and disclosure of the categories above (i.e., identifiers and contact information, categories of personal information described in [Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.80.), Internet or other electronic network activity information, professional or employment-related information, and inferences drawn from such information) to marketing partners within the last 12 months, could fall within California’s definitions of “selling” or “sharing.” “Sharing” is referred to as “targeted advertising” in some states.  
‍  
To the extent we use your personal information across non-Innovation Refunds businesses, websites, and applications for targeted advertising purposes, you may opt-out of such use (“opt-out of selling/sharing”). To do so, you may email your request to [\[email protected\]](https://www.innovationrefunds.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), [complete this form](https://qualify.innovationrefunds.com/partner-share-opt-out), or use an opt-out preference signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC) on browsers and/or browser extensions that support such  a signal. To download and use a browser supporting the GPC browser signal, click here: [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs). If you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.  
‍  
If you do not have an Innovation Refunds account or if you are not logged into your Innovation Refunds account, your request to opt-out of selling/sharing will be linked to your browser identifier only and not linked to any account information because the connection between your browser and the account is not known to us. If you would like us to make the connection between your browser and your account, and you have not yet opted-out of selling/sharing your personal information, please [submit this form](https://qualify.innovationrefunds.com/partner-share-opt-out).  
‍  
Your decision will not alter the number of advertisements you see, only whether those advertisements are tailored to you.  
‍  
We do not use or disclose your sensitive personal information for any purposes other than those permitted by law (e.g., as necessary to file for your refund or for legal compliance purposes), and we do not disclose personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you consent.

Digital Technologies
--------------------

Innovation Refunds and its marketing partners may use various online tracking technologies such as pixels, web beacons, session replay technology, social sharing widgets, software developer kits, third-party libraries, cookies, and other similar online tracking technologies (collectively, “online tracking technologies”) to gather information when you interact with our websites, platforms, app(s), and email communications, as well as when you interact with other websites, apps, or advertisements.

We use online tracking technologies to maintain our Services (e.g., improving security, fixing bugs), improve your experience (e.g., preventing website crashes, saving your preferences), and guide our marketing efforts (e.g., generating leads and tailoring our marketing efforts). When you visit certain websites or use an app (including our website, platform, and app(s)), the online tracking technologies may collect identifiers (e.g., your Internet Protocol address or other online identifier), categories of personal information described in [Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.80.), Internet or other electronic network activity information, and inferences about you. Our partners (e.g., social media networks) may also supplement this data with information about your professional or employment-related information (e.g., job title) and other demographics. Our marketing partners disclose such information to us, and where we collect such information, we disclose it to them, for marketing purposes (e.g., targeting advertisements so individuals view more relevant ads).

Among other cookies, we use Google Analytics. You can learn more about how those cookies work by visiting “How Google Uses Data When You Use Our Partners’ Sites or Apps,” located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). If you prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your internet browser or other third party software on your workstation can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the type of browser you are using, you might be able to configure your browser: (i) to prompt you to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis; or (ii) to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for specific details about cookie security. For general information about how to manage cookies, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/) (please note that this website is not connected to us and we are not responsible for its content).

How Long We Keep Your Personal Information
------------------------------------------

We will not retain your personal information for longer than reasonably necessary for the purpose(s) we collected it. The retention period depends on criteria such as the nature of our relationship with you, whether we filed for a tax refund for you, when you last interacted with us, the type of personal information at issue, and legal considerations.

How We Protect Your Personal Information
----------------------------------------

Although no website, app, platform, or business is 100 percent secure, the security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to us. We do take administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the information you provide to us.

Your Choices
------------

In addition to the choices described above, we provide you with the:

* ability to know what personal information we have collected about you, including the categories of personal information, categories of sources from which we collected the personal information, the purpose for our collection, selling, or sharing of your personal information, the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information
* ability to access the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;
* ability to correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you;
* ability to delete personal information we have collected from you, subject to exceptions (like our legally required recordkeeping);
* ability to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information; and
* ability to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy choices.

How to Submit a Request to Know, Access, Correct, or Delete
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to submit a request to know, access, correct, or delete your personal information, you or your authorized agent may complete [this webform](https://forms.office.com/r/bPY4aen2px) or email your request to [\[email protected\]](https://www.innovationrefunds.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Once you submit your request, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity (e.g., via your Innovation Refunds account or asking you to provide us with information matching the information in our files about you (e.g., your email address and phone number)). If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of another individual, we will also verify that you have authority to act for the data subject (e.g., a signed authorization).

Once we have verified your request, we will make good faith efforts to evaluate and act on your request, but there may be circumstances in which we might not grant your request (e.g., if you submit a request to delete that would violate our recordkeeping obligations). If we deny your request, we will tell you why and provide you information regarding your ability to appeal that decision, if any.

Links to Third-Party Websites
-----------------------------

Our website, platform, and app(s) contain links to third party websites, applications, or materials and integrations to enhance the Services and your experience. These items may have their own privacy policies, or no policies at all. You should seek and review these third party’s policies before providing them information. We do not guarantee and are not responsible for the privacy or security of these other websites, apps, or integrations, including the accuracy, completeness or reliability of their information.
