This career engagement platform site including any mobile applications hereof (“Site”) is owned and operated by Firsthand, an affiliate of Infobase Holdings, Inc. (“Firsthand”). By accessing or using this Site and the resources and services available herein (collectively, the “Online Services”), you agree to these Terms & Conditions (these “Terms”).  If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or use the Online Services. If you have any questions about the Terms, please contact us at [support@firsthand.co](mailto:support@firsthand.co).

* Your name, a valid e-mail address, and such other information as we may require from time to time; and
* A username and password.

Alternatively, you may be seamlessly logged into the Online Services through single-sign-on via your employer’s or academic institution’s intranet portal, and/or you may choose to be authenticated through a third-party social media or authentication service (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Google).

You may also choose to provide other types of information about your education and background in your Firsthand profile which you acknowledge may be publicly accessible through the Online Services.

You represent and warrant that any information you provide to Firsthand in connection with your Account will be true, accurate, current, and complete.  Your Firsthand Account is personal to you, and you may not share your Account information with, or allow access to your account by, any third party.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password(s) and for restricting access to your computer, and for all activities that occur under your Account or password.  You will be solely responsible for the losses incurred by us and others due to any unauthorized use of your account.  You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account and/or password(s) and any other breach of security relating to the Online Services.  We reserve the right to terminate any Account at any time in our sole discretion, including without limitation for any failure to comply with these Terms, any fraud or abuse, or any misrepresentation that you or anyone using your Account may make to us.

If you are accessing the Online Services through a school, university or other institution that has an active written agreement with Firsthand, your access to the Online Services expires with the expiration of your institution’s written agreement with Firsthand, unless your institution renews this agreement.

To ensure continuous access to the Online Services if you are an individual paying for access to the Online Services, unless you have turned the auto-renew off in your Account (or are otherwise accessing the Online Services under a separate written agreement with Firsthand through your institution), you agree that your subscription to the Online Services will automatically renew for successive renewal terms at the end of your current term at the then-prevailing subscription rate.

Firsthand reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Terms on behalf of itself and its licensors and suppliers. You acknowledge and agree that any feedback, comments, or suggestions that you may choose to provide to Firsthand in connection with the Site or Services will become the sole property of Firsthand and Firsthand will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.  All trademarks, service marks, and trade names (collectively the “Marks”) that appear in the Online Services are proprietary to Firsthand, or the other respective owners of such Marks. You may not display or reproduce the Marks in any manner without the prior written consent of Firsthand, and you may not remove or otherwise modify in any manner any trademark notices from any content offered or received through the Online Services.

The Online Services are intended for your individual use and may not be resold or redistributed to third parties. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any of the content or communications featured or displayed in the Online Services ("Content"), including without limitation text, graphics, photographs, images, moving images, sound, illustrations, information, software, products or services and the arrangements thereof, except as expressly permitted hereunder. You acknowledge that any unauthorized use of any Content could cause irreparable harm to us and agree that in the event of any such unauthorized use, we will be entitled to an injunction in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity. Subject to any expressly stated restrictions or limitations stated in the Online Services relating to specific material, you may electronically copy and/or print hard copy portions of Content solely for your own noncommercial use, or to place an order with us. Any other use of Content, including the modification, reproduction, distribution, republication, display or transmission of any Content, without our prior written permission is strictly prohibited.

You agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Site or use or access to the Online Services, including without limitation any "scraping" or using any robot, spider or other automated means (provided that nothing herein shall prohibit an Advisor from conducting paid Advisee services through the functionality of the Site as permitted herein). Running or displaying the Online Services or any information or material displayed on this Site in frames, via "in-line" linking or through similar means on another website without our prior written permission is prohibited. Any permitted links to the Online Services must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. You may not use any meta tags or other "hidden text" utilizing our name or any of our trademarks, or those of any manufacturer of products featured on this Site, without express written permission. Additionally, you agree that you will not: (a) take any action that, in our sole discretion, imposes, or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (b) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any activities conducted on the Site; or (c) bypass any measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site.

**Making a Purchase**

If you wish to purchase Resources (as hereinafter defined) available through the Online Services and free access to such resources is not available through your school, university or institution, you will be asked to supply certain information, including but not limited to your credit card or other payment information and your shipping address for any tangible products. You agree that all information that you provide to us will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred through your Account and/or any credit card or other payment mechanism issued to you, including without limitation any applicable taxes and shipping, handling and processing charges, if any, relating to such purchases and transactions. We will charge your credit card when your item is purchased. Credit card orders shipped to a location other than your billing address may require additional verification. All monetary transactions through the Online Services shall take place in U.S. dollars. You are not permitted to purchase products or services through the Online Services that are intended for resale. Firsthand currently uses third parties to process payments. Our third-party payment processors accept payments through various credit cards, including, but not limited to: Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as detailed on the applicable payment screen.

Firsthand also does not issue refunds for memberships and career services (like resume reviews by an expert) that are purchased through the Online Services.

**Mentoring Sessions and Career Placement Services**

The Online Services are a resource to students (“Students”), alumni (“Alumni”), job seekers and employers.  The Online Services provide various resources, networking opportunities, and a communication platform for Advisors and Advisees (as such terms are defined below) to connect. The Online Services enable communications between Students, Alumni or other job seekers (collectively, “Advisees”) and registered career advisors (“Advisors”) that are selected by the Advisee through the Online Services to receive career mentorship and advice during mentoring sessions. Although Firsthand provides the platform, the Advisor and Advisee negotiate and enter a contract regarding the price for the sessions.  Many Students and Alumni will be provided access to the Online Services through their academic institution (“Institution”), which may include access through a co-branded solution accessible through their Institution’s intranet portal and which may also include the mentoring sessions at no additional cost. In such instances, the written Subscription Agreement between Firsthand and the Institution shall control in the event of any conflicting terms with these Terms.  For all other Advisees, the cost of the mentoring sessions shall be established by the selected Advisors and all payments for the mentoring sessions must occur through the Online Services. The Online Services also offer a variety of career placement services including member directories, events, fairs, job postings, alumni groups, discussion forums, direct messaging capabilities and other career-oriented content and resources (“Resources”). 

Firsthand makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to (a) the willingness or ability of any specific Advisor to give advice or provide opportunities, (b) whether the Advisee will find the advice or opportunities given by an Advisor satisfactory, (c) whether the advice or opportunities the Advisor offers will provide an adequate answer to the Advisee’s question(s) or (d) whether the Advisor’s advice will otherwise be suitable to the Advisee’s needs.  Advisee acknowledges and agrees that Firsthand does not screen, refer, endorse, recommend, verify, evaluate or guarantee any advice, opportunities, information or other services provided by Advisors. Advisees should not consider anything to be a referral, endorsement, recommendation or guarantee by Firsthand of an Advisor’s advice, opportunities, information or other services. Firsthand does not guarantee the validity, accuracy, completeness, safety, legality, quality or applicability of the Resources on the Site and anything spoken or written by its Advisors, including any information contained in an Advisor profile which is the sole opinion of the Advisor.

**User Submissions**

The Online Services allow users to upload, post, and transmit text, resumes, survey results, photographs, images, posts, communications, personally identifiable information, video/audio/sound recordings, ratings, reviews or other materials or information ("Submission"). You own and retain all rights to your Submission and you grant to Firsthand a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, fully sublicenseable and transferable right and license to access, use and display your Submission to enable your use of the Online Services and as otherwise permitted by these Terms. You agree to the following:

* your Submission does not contain programming or materials containing any Trojan horses, viruses, worms, harmful code, or other potentially damaging information, programs, or file; and
* Firsthand’s use of your Submission does not violate these Terms and will not cause injury to any person or entity.

Firsthand does not and cannot review all Submissions posted to or created by users accessing the Online Services and is not in any manner responsible for the content of these Submissions. Firsthand will have no obligation to review or post any Submission(s). Firsthand reserves the right to block or remove Submissions and/or users at any time in its sole and absolute discretion.

By submitting your Submission, you agree to release, hold harmless and indemnify on behalf of yourself and your successors, assigns and representatives, Firsthand and each of its respective officers, directors and employees from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, demands, liabilities and damages of any kind whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the use of your Submission, including, without limitation, any and all claims for false advertising, copyright infringement, invasion of privacy, violation of the right of publicity or of moral rights, and/or defamation. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event will you be entitled to, and you waive any right to, enjoin, restrain or interfere with use of your Submission or the exploitation of any of the Firsthand's rights as noted above.

You acknowledge that you may not terminate or rescind the grants of rights and licenses and/or the releases contained in these Terms at a later time. Firsthand does not guarantee that you will have any opportunity to edit or delete your Submission. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the contents of your Submission(s).

**Data Protection**

Firsthand shall implement and maintain appropriate technical, physical and organizational controls to protect the integrity and security of the Online Services. In order to access and use the Online Services, you will need to submit and transmit certain personally identifiable information to Firsthand and the Online Services and you hereby acknowledge and agree that such personally identifiable information will be subject to the [Firsthand Privacy Policy](https://firsthand.co/about-pages/newco-legal-docs/firsthand-privacy-policy/)  (“Privacy Policy”) and these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into, and forms an integral part of, these Terms and if you do not agree to, and comply with, the Privacy Policy, you may not access or use the Online Services. You further acknowledge and agree that you will be solely responsible for the following: (i) the accuracy, quality, and legality of personally identifiable information submitted and transmitted to the Online Services; (ii) complying with all necessary transparency and lawfulness requirements under applicable law for the collection and use of the personally identifiable information, including obtaining any necessary consents and authorizations; and (iii) ensuring you have the right to transfer, or provide access to, the personally identifiable information to Firsthand and the Online Services. You are not permitted to submit or transmit to the Online Services, or otherwise provide Firsthand, with any “sensitive” or “special categories” of personally identifiable information that are afforded heightened legal protection (e.g., social security numbers), unless otherwise agreed to separately by Firsthand, you are solely responsible for reviewing the Online Services, including any available security documentation and features, to determine whether they satisfy your requirements, business needs, and legal obligations.

California Users. To the extent that the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (“**CCPA**”) applies to your use of the Online Services, this clause shall apply. Unless defined elsewhere in these Terms, each capitalized term that is used, but not defined, in this clause shall be ascribed the meaning set forth in the CCPA. Each party acknowledges and agrees that you shall be considered a Business and Firsthand shall, in its role of providing the Online Services, be considered a Service Provider for purposes of the CCPA. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that the collection and disclosure of Personal Information submitted and transmitted to the Online Services (i) does not constitute, and is not the intent of either party for such disclosure to constitute, a Sale of Personal Information under the CCPA, and (ii) if valuable consideration, monetary or otherwise, is being provided by you to Firsthand, such valuable consideration, monetary or otherwise, is so being provided for use of the Online Services and not for the disclosure of Personal Information. You hereby represent to Firsthand that you shall only disclose Personal Information to Firsthand and the Online Services for a permissible Business Purpose and you have the consent or other lawful basis to so furnish such Personal Information to Firsthand and the Online Services. Firsthand shall only Process your Personal Information in accordance with these Terms, unless otherwise required by law, or judicial or administrative order or rule. Without limiting the foregoing, Firsthand shall not retain, use, or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Online Services, or as otherwise permitted by law or these Terms, including retaining, using, or disclosing your Personal Information for a Commercial Purpose other than providing the Online Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Firsthand shall not Sell your Personal Information or authorize or otherwise permit any third party subcontractor to undertake the same.  Upon written request from you, Firsthand shall promptly provide you access to, and/or delete, your Personal Information in Firsthand’s custody or control, or in the custody or control of a third party acting on Firsthand’s behalf, or otherwise provide you the technical controls necessary to satisfy the same. In the event Firsthand is unable to delete your Personal Information for reasons permitted under law, Firsthand shall (i) promptly inform you of the reason(s) therefor, (ii) continue to protect the privacy, confidentiality, and security of such Personal Information in accordance with these Terms, and (iii) delete such Personal Information promptly as soon as reasonably practicable.

European, Swiss, and UK Users.  You acknowledge and agree to notify Firsthand of any intent you have to submit or transmit personally identifiable information to Firsthand and the Online Service that is subject to, or otherwise afforded protection under, European Union (EU), Swiss, or United Kingdom (UK) data protection laws. In the event you are permitted by Firsthand to submit or transmit such personally identifiable information to the Online Services, each party shall comply with its obligations and responsibilities set forth in Exhibit 1 (**Data Processing Addendum**). Notwithstanding any other provision within this Agreement, to the extent Firsthand collects and processes, on your behalf, any personally identifiable information that is subject to, or otherwise afforded protection under, EU, Swiss, or UK data protections laws, such collection and processing shall be subject to Exhibit 1 only (and not the Privacy Policy). In the event of a conflict between these Terms and Exhibit 1, the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit 1 shall supersede and control with respect to such conflict. For the avoidance of doubt, each party understands and agrees that Firsthand’s collection and use of business contact data of your employees, personnel, or third parties involved in performance or use of the Online Services does not constitute processing on your behalf for purposes of Exhibit 1 and in the event Firsthand collects and processes such business contact data, it shall comply with its [Privacy Policy](https://firsthand.co/about-pages/newco-legal-docs/firsthand-privacy-policy/). You shall immediately, and within ten (10) days after execution of these Terms, provide written notice to Firsthand with respect to the supervisory authority responsible for ensuring your compliance with, as applicable, EU, Swiss, or UK data protections laws and such supervisory authority(ies) shall be incorporated into the Standard Contractual Clauses (as defined in Exhibit 1), including at Clause 13 and Annex I.

2.1         This DPA only supplements the provisions of the Terms in relation to the Online Services provided by the Data Processor to the Data Controller pursuant to the Terms.

1.           DATA PROCESSING OBLIGATIONS

3.1         With respect to Personal Data uploaded to the Online Services, the Data Controller will be responsible for complying with all requirements that apply to it under Applicable Data Protection Laws. In particular but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Data Controller acknowledges and agrees that it will be solely responsible for the following: (i) the accuracy, quality, and legality of Personal Data uploaded to the Online Services; (ii) complying with all necessary transparency and lawfulness requirements under applicable law for the collection and use of the Personal Data, including obtaining any necessary consents and authorizations; (iii) ensuring the Data Controller has the right to transfer, or provide access to, the Personal Data to the Data Processor for Processing in accordance with the Terms (including this DPA); and (iv) ensuring that its Processing instructions comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws. The Data Controller will not input into the Online Services, or otherwise provide the Data Processor, with any Special Categories of Personal Data, unless otherwise agreed to separately by the Data Controller. The Data Controller will inform the Data Processor, immediately and without undue delay, if Data Controller is not able to comply with its responsibilities set forth in this DPA.

3.2         The Data Processor agrees to Process the Personal Data in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this DPA, and in particular the Data Processor undertakes: (i) to Process the Personal Data only on behalf of the Data Controller and at all times in compliance with the Data Controller’s Instructions as defined in this DPA, and all Applicable Data Protection Laws; (ii) to ensure that any personnel entrusted with Processing the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; and (iii) to implement and maintain commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to appropriately protect Personal Data against a Personal Data Breach, and which shall include security requirements no less stringent than the ones the Data Processor implements and maintains to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its own proprietary information.

The Data Processor will not respond directly to that request, except to notify the Data Subject that it is acting on behalf of the Data Controller and to furnish the Data Subject with the contact information of the Data Controller. The Data Processor, taking into account the nature of the Processing, will assist the Data Controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Data Controller’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject’s rights.
