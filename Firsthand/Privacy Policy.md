We may collect personal information about you from third parties, which we may combine with other information we already retain in order to provide the Online Services or promote our legal or business interests.  For example, Institutions that partner with Firsthand may provide personal information to us so we can create user accounts for their students. In addition, employers may provide us with personal information and other background data on their job applicants so we can assist with their employment recruitment process.  If you provide personal information about a third party, then you expressly represent and warrant to Firsthand that you have the full right and lawful authority to provide Firsthand with the information.

1. **How We Use Your Information**

We use, process and retain your personal information to provide the Online Services, and to promote and defend our business interests. This includes:

* Providing and administering the Online Services, including executing transactions and enabling you to access the services therein.
* Delivering to you notice about job opportunities and communications from potential employers.
* Analyzing your use of the Online Services to personalize them to you (e.g., suggest employers to you based on your Resume Data).
* Contacting you directly and providing you information about the Online Services or on our other products or offerings and answering service requests.
* Tracking and updating your orders and invoices.
* Furnishing you technical notices and security alerts, and support and administrative messages.
* Performing analyses that help us to develop and improve the quality of our Online Services, and other products, and offerings.
* Furnishing you questionnaires and conducting research and analysis to help us better understand your purchasing preferences, identify the products and services that best meet your requirements, measuring the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing, or to otherwise improve our business.
* Enforcing security and legal requirements, such as detecting, preventing and responding to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our **Terms of Service**, violations of law or other misuse of our Online Services, products, or facilities.
* Administering and protecting our business and our Online Services, including system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data.
* Protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, and others in our community.
* Promoting, defending or protecting our legal, regulatory, or business interests, including enforcing contracts and other agreements.
* In any other way with your consent.

**Survey Data**

In important part of our Services is to undertake professional surveys to better understand employer and employee needs, capabilities, and business models and develop ratings for certain types of categories related thereto.  In the event you participate in such a survey, we will use the information derived therefrom for the following purposes:

_Employer Profiles_. As part of our Employer Profile surveys, you have an opportunity to provide us feedback about your workplace experience with a particular employer. Our editors consolidate, review, and analyze your feedback (and the survey results of other participants) and write a summary of these experiences within an Employer Profile on our Site. Firsthand editors may also select quotes from within your survey feedback to include as part of an Employer Profile. Please be aware that Employer Profiles, including your feedback therein, may be published to the general public and therefore you should avoid including in your feedback any personal information or other details that might compromise your own anonymity or that of any other individual.

_Employee/Intern Reviews_. For our Employee/Intern Review surveys, you have an opportunity to provide us feedback about your workplace experience with a particular employer and your feedback may be published within an Employer Review on our Site. Your feedback may be posted without any editorial review by us. In addition, you may register with Firsthand in order to submit reviews, insights, and opinions about your current or former employers or schools. In either case, while your name is not associated with a quotation or review, the review may be accompanied by general identifiers, where provided, such as office location, position/level, department, or year in which the survey was conducted. The review also identifies whether you are a “verified employee” or “verified intern” to indicate that the comment was collected through Firsthand’s survey process and distinguish it from other user-generated reviews.

_Blog Posts, Career Advice, and Other Forums_. Firsthand may use anonymous comments and/or aggregated scores provided to our surveys for the purposes of publishing blog posts or articles; making presentations; or participating in public or private forums or other discussions on employee satisfaction, perceptions of employers, and industry trends.

_Research Reports_. Firsthand may use aggregated and de-identified data from our surveys for the purposes of client research, to help employers benchmark employers against the industry and their peers and/or to gauge relative levels of satisfaction among their own employees. In the event these research reports include the survey’s text feedback, Firsthand reviews and edits, as necessary, such feedback to seek to minimize the personal information associated with your comments. However, you should be aware that their comments may be published or used for research and avoid including details that might compromise their anonymity.

1. **Sharing Your Personal Information With Others**

We may also share your personal information with our third party professional advisors and consultants (e.g., outside counsel, tax advisors).

Corporate Restructuring. If we (or our assets) are acquired by another legal entity, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that legal entity would receive all information gathered by Firsthand via the Online Services, including your personal information retained thereon. To the extent practicable, we will notify you of any such change in corporate ownership by posting a notice on the Site or taking similar actions.

Compelled Disclosure. We will use or disclose your personal information if required by law, statute, or regulation, or judicial or administrative order or decree, or any other demand submitted by a government, regulatory, or judicial entity that has the force and effect of law.

1. **Third Party Links, Single Sign On (SSO)**

Firsthand may include in the Online Services certain links to other websites, including websites operated by unaffiliated third parties. Each such third party website has its own privacy policies and practices, which may be different than the policies and practices described herein; we urge you to read any privacy policy posted on a third party website carefully as such third party privacy policy (and not this Privacy Policy) controls with respect to the collection, use, and processing of your personal information thereon. Additionally, to the extent that you follow a link to a website operated by an independent third party, please be aware that Firsthand exercises no authority or control over that third party and we cannot be, and are not, responsible for any information that you may submit at that website or how it is used.

You may log into our Online Services through or from a third party social media or authentication service (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Google).

In all other cases, we retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Firsthand is based in the United States and the personal information that we (and our third party service providers) collect and process is retained and stored in the United States. Please be aware that (i) the United States may not provide the same level of protection of personal information as in your country, state, or jurisdiction of residence or nationality, (ii) the European Union and other foreign authorities have determined that, in some circumstances, the United States does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, and (iii) when transferred to the United States, your personal information may be accessible by, or otherwise made available to, government authorities and officials pursuant to regulatory, judicial, and/or administrative orders, decrees, and demands, and/or other domestic laws, statutes, and regulations, applicable in the United States.

You hereby consent to your personal information being transferred to, and stored in, the United States and the other jurisdictions where we (and our service providers) operate.

1. **Information Security**

We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, no information system can be fully secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Online Services over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks, and you provide us with any information and data at your own risk. To the extent permitted by law, Firsthand shall not be liable or otherwise responsible for any data incident that compromiseS OR MAY COMPROMISE the confidentiality, SECURITY, integrity, or AVAILABILITY of your personal information. The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a username and password to access the Online Services, you are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of those credentials and not revealing them to others.
