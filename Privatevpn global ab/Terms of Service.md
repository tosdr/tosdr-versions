Terms of Use
============

1\. General
-----------

These terms and conditions of sale (the “Terms”) apply for the VPN services provided by PrivateVPN Global AB, reg. no.  559282-2182 (the “**PrivateVPN**”). By accessing and/or registering on PrivateVPN's website, installing, and/or using Service (as defined below) you are agreeing to have read and understood, and agree to comply with and be legally bound by the Terms in their entirety. The Terms constitute a legally binding agreement (the “**Agreement**”) between you and PrivateVPN. If you are using the Service (as defined below) on behalf of a legal entity, you are agreeing to commit to these Terms on behalf of that legal entity.

  

The Terms govern your use of and access to our website, customer support, any interactive areas, software, applications and other service (the “**Service**”). These Terms also govern the use of and access to PrivateVPN’s content (the “**Content**”), which includes the PrivateVPN’s website (the “**Site**”), applications (the “**Apps**”), and any software provided by PrivateVPN (the “**Software**”).

  

Please read the Terms carefully as they contain important information about the Service as well as your and PrivateVPN’s respective obligations and rights. The Terms include a dispute resolution clause that governs how possible disputes will be resolved. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use the Service.

  

By registering on PrivateVPN, you represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age or that you are a valid legal entity, and that the registration information that you have provided is accurate, current and complete and that your will promptly notify us if your information changes.

  

By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the [Privacy Policy](https://privatevpn.com/privacy-policy) (“Privacy Policy”).

  

  

2\. About the Service
---------------------

The Service provided by PrivateVPN is normally called VPN and it protects personal information with the use of encryption and masks user metadata by hiding your IP address and replacing it with one of ours. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a way for you to remain anonymous on the Internet by using only secure computer connections. The security is due to the Internet traffic being encrypted in such a degree that only your computer and the computer communicating with you can interpret the data sent between computers. The traffic can still be bugged, but the person intercepting it will not be able to understand the collected information.

Your use of the Service is at your own risk.

  

  

3\. Privacy Policy
------------------

During your registration and during your use of the Service, PrivateVPN may collect some sensitive personal information. For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a separate document known as the Privacy Policy, which is available on the Site. Please review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your data.

  

  

4\. Subscription and pricing
----------------------------

PrivateVPN’s Service is available to you upon registration on the Site. By paying a fixed price in advance for your selected subscription plan, you agree to become a subscriber for the period you have elected.

  

A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site. PrivateVPN reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site or sent via email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect your current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies.

  

You can choose between the following subscription plans (as amended from time to time):

  

* 1 month;
* 3 months;
* 12 months.

  

Subscriptions plans above (“**Subscriptions**”) renew automatically by default at the completion of the initial subscription term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the relevant Subscriptions, accordingly. The prices are determined on the Site, whereas the prices may vary when purchasing through the App Store or an official reseller. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method you last selected. If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may sign in to the Site and turn off auto-renewal before the new subscription period begins. By default, auto-renewal is turned on when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or Paypal), and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such as Bitcoin). 

  

Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use on up to 10 different devices at any given time. If you want to use the Service on more than 10 devices at a time, then you can either (i) use PrivateVPN on your router, (ii) purchase additional subscription plans.

  

  

5\. Access to the service and payment method
--------------------------------------------

To access the Service, you must first create an account by providing your email address. You pay the price for the requested Service prior to downloading od the application. As soon as PrivateVPN has received confirmation that payment has been made, you will receive an email confirmation that the payment has been made. After you have received the email, you gain access to the App.

Payment must be made in advance and paid through Paypal, Stripe, or with Bitcoin, using one of the payment methods listed on the Site.

  

  

6\. Duration of the Agreement
-----------------------------

This Agreement takes effect when you pay the fee and gain access to the Service. The Agreement will expire at the end of the Agreement period that the customer paid for, subject to Section 4 (Subscription and pricing) above.

  

  

7\. Refund policy
-----------------

The Distance and Doorstep Sales Act (2005:59) provides that a purchaser of a service has the right to cancel the service in some cases. We offer a 30-day return when you buy our Service (“**Refund**”).

  

Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or purchasing of additional licenses under the same account, shall constitute a waiver of the Refund option. To request a Refund, send an email with your request to the following email address: [support@privatevpn.com](mailto:support@privatevpn.com). You agree to provide PrivateVPN with reasons for requesting the Refund.

  

The Refund will be made without undue delay and in any case no later than 14 days from the day we were notified of your decision to withdraw from the Agreement. We will use the same means of payment for the Refund that you have used for the initial purchase, unless you have expressly agreed with us otherwise. In any case, the Refund will not cost you anything.

  

If your subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchase through the App Store/iTunes, you do not have access to the PrivateVPN 30-day money-back guarantee. Instead, you can request refunds through the App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple Support

  

This provision is not applicable on contractual amounts lower than SEK 400/ USD 45. In addition, this provision is not applicable for the renewal of the purchased Service (i.e. Subscriptions after their automatic renewals)

  

Bitcoin payments or other cryptocurrencies are non-refundable.
