**Information on how we process your personal data**

1. ****Introduction  
    ****
    
    This Privacy Policy (the “**Policy**”) describes how Starbreeze AB, reg. no. 556551-8932 (“**Starbreeze**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”), at the address c/o STARBREEZE STUDIOS AB, Box 7731, 103 95, Sweden, processes your personal data when you visit and use our website, or come into contact with us because of our business and services – usually because you represent a corporate customer, supplier or a partner of ours. Please note that we have separate privacy policies for each game we provide.
    
    We are responsible for the processing of your personal data as described in the Policy in the capacity of data controller. If you would like to know more about our processing of your personal data, you are welcome to contact us through our data protection officer at [\[email protected\]](https://www.starbreeze.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
    
    It is important to us that you feel comfortable with how we process your personal data, and we therefore ask you to read through this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we make changes to the Policy, the new version will apply from the time it is published on our website. At the top of the page, you can see when the Policy was last changed.
    
2. ****How we collect your personal data  
    ****
    
    The personal data we process relating to you is mainly collected from you when you visit and use our website or when we come into contact with you – e.g. via email, telephone or personal meetings, conferences, conventions or similar occasions. We may also collect your personal data from a third party, usually from the company you represent.
    
3. ****How we process your personal data  
    ****3.1  ****Introduction****
    
    We only process your personal data to the extent permitted in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. This means inter alia that we need to have a legal basis for the purposes for our processing of your personal data, which in our context generally means one of the following legal basis.
    
    **Performance of a contract** – the processing is necessary in order for us to provide you with our services or otherwise perform a contract between us (this applies if you conduct your business in a sole proprietorship), or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.
    
    If you are acting on behalf of someone else, e.g. in the capacity of representative of a company (which usually is the case), our processing is carried out with reference to our legitimate interest balanced against your interests or fundamental rights or freedoms, where our legitimate interest is to conclude and perform the contract with the company you represent.
    
    **Performance of legal obligations** – the processing is necessary in order to fulfil our legal obligations according to law or other statutes that we are subject to, or if we are subject to orders or decisions by courts or authorities, which require us to process your personal data.
    
    **Legitimate interests** – the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, provided that they are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights or freedoms (in which case the processing would not be allowed).

    We have taken measures to ensure that your personal data is handled in a safe way. For example, access to systems where personal data is stored is limited to our employees and service providers who require it in the course of their duties. Such parties are informed of the importance of maintaining security and confidentiality in relation to the personal data we process. We maintain appropriate safeguards and security standards to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure or misuse. We also monitor our systems to discover vulnerabilities. In addition, data processing agreements have been entered into with our suppliers of systems and services (see further Sections 5 and 6 below).
    
5. ******How we share your personal data******
    
    Access to your personal data is limited to persons who require such access for the purposes described in Section 3 above. Your personal data will therefore be shared with the following categories of third party recipients:
    
    1. Companies within our group: We will share your personal data with other companies within our group. If we share your personal data with other companies within our group, we will ensure that the personal data continues to be processed in line with this Policy.
    2. Service providers: We use third party service providers to manage parts of our business operations. We will share personal data with such third parties in order for them to supply us with services, e.g. IT services or other administrative functions or provide services as sub-contractors in connection with our own services. When we use such service providers, we enter into data processing agreements and take other suitable measures to ensure that your personal data is processed in line with this Policy.
    3. Our partners: We will from time to time cooperate with external parties in order to improve our services and business. Such parties either process your personal data as data controllers according to their own terms and policies for handling personal data, or as our data processors according to our instructions. In the latter case, we enter into data processing agreements and take other suitable measures to ensure that your personal data is processed in line with this Policy.
    4. Sale or transfer of business or assets: We will share your personal data with a buyer/investor or prospective buyer/investor in the event of a sale, assignment or other transfer of all or parts of our shares, assets or operations. When such transfer occurs, we will take actions in order to ensure that the receiving party processes your personal data in accordance with this Policy. The purpose of such sharing or processing of your personal data is to allow a (potential) buyer/investor to carry out an assessment of us as a company and, where necessary, take actions and make preparations in the event a sale, assignment or other transfer should occur, where such sharing or processing of your personal data is carried out with reference to the legitimate interests of allowing such assessment, actions and preparations by the (potential) buyer/investor.
    5. Public authorities: We will share your personal data with public authorities such as the Swedish Police or the Swedish Tax Agency when we are required to do so by e.g. applicable law or other legal statutes or orders or decisions by courts or authorities in order to fulfil the legal obligation specified therein.
6.  ******Where we process your personal data******
    
    We strive to always process your personal data within the EU or EEA. However, we will transfer your personal data to service providers who, either themselves or by their sub-contractors, are located or have business activities in a country outside the EU or EEA. In such cases, we are responsible for ensuring that the transfer is made in accordance with applicable data protection legislation before it occurs, e.g. by ensuring that the country in which the recipient is located ensures an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission, or by ensuring appropriate safeguards based on the use of standard contractual clauses that the European Commission has adopted and other appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms.
    
    You may access a list of the countries that the European Commission has decided provide an adequate level of data protection at https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions\_en.
    
    You may access the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses at [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32010D0087).
    
    The countries outside the EU/EEA to which our suppliers currently transfer personal data are: USA and United Kingdom.

    **You have a right to object to our processing of your personal data when it is based on our or another party’s legitimate interest.

    **7.6 Right to data portability  
    **If our processing of your personal data is based on the performance of a contract with you or your consent, you have the right to receive the personal data you have provided us relating to you in an electronic format. You also have the right to have the personal data transferred from us directly to another data controller, where technically feasible.
    
    We ask you to observe that this right to so called data portability does not cover personal data which we process manually.
    
    **7.7 Right to withdraw consent  
    **If our processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you always have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. A withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing that took place based on the consent before your withdrawal.
    
8.  ****Complaints with the supervisory authority  
    ****
    
    In Sweden, the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (_Sw._ Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) is the authority responsible for supervising the application of current data protection legislation. If you believe that we process your personal data in a wrongful manner, we encourage you to contact us so that we can review your concerns. However, you may file a complaint with the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection at any time.
