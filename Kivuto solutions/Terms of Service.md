2. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, that provision shall be deemed severable and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.
3. You acknowledge that Kivuto will be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Agreement by You or by Your unauthorized use of the Website, Website Content, the Materials or the Kivuto Products, as applicable, and, further, that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for such harm. You agree that Kivuto shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies and without further demonstration of irreparable harm or the inadequacy of monetary damages, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in the event of any breach of this Agreement by You.
4. This Agreement is the entire agreement between Kivuto and You with respect to the Website, Website Content, the Materials and the Kivuto Products, as applicable. Headings in this Agreement are for Your convenience only and do not have any legal meaning or effect. If Kivuto waives or fails to enforce any term or condition of this Agreement on any one or more occasions, whether by conduct or otherwise, its waiver or failure to enforce will not mean that it must waive or cannot enforce such term or condition on any other occasion, or any other term or condition of this Agreement. In addition to being a part of the registration form, this Agreement resides on Kivuto’s main website under the “Terms of Use” link so that You may reference it at any time.
5. It is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and all related documents be drawn up in English. C’est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que tous les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.
6. Kivuto’s licensors for the Materials are the only Third-Party beneficiaries to this Agreement, and each licensor is entitled to enforce these provisions directly to the extent it deems such enforcement is necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of the Materials’ authors hereunder.
