### INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE

Operation Smile, like most website owners, receives and records information from various sources as it relates to your interaction with Operation Smile owned sites and digital properties. The type of information we and/or our third party providers collect depends on the interaction between you and us. This could be when making a donation, applying for a job/to volunteer or through an online purchase. We gather information through postal communications, visits to our websites or apps, participation with our business/corporate partners, electronic communications, volunteering or communications through social media.

This information is used solely for our own data analysis, audits, enhancing or improving user experience and donor acquisition and retention purposes. We will not sell, share (except possibly with another Operation Smile affiliate when it is required to carry out the transactions you initiate), or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We will use reasonable efforts to (1) undertake a privacy impact assessment whenever there is a fundamental change in the way we process data, (2) implement records management systems, and (3) log data security incidents.

### CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Personal information is information that can identify a person, such as name, address, telephone number, and email address.

We strive for accurate, respectful and relevant communications with our constituents. We occasionally exchange mailing addresses with select non-profit groups. We will not sell, rent or share your email address or telephone number. If you would like to correct or update your personal information, modify your mailing preferences, or if you do not wish to participate in mailing address exchange activities, please call 1-888-OPSMILE (1-888-677-6453) or email [\[email protected\]](https://www.operationsmile.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Please also understand marketing campaigns are scheduled in advance so while we will remove you from the mailing list in a timely manner, you may still receive materials from campaigns which were in process prior to your request to be removed for up to 90 days.

We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our emails. However, you may modify your email preferences at any time. Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to change your expressed interests, or to cease receiving email from us altogether. If you would like to modify your preferences, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email you receive from us, contact us directly or visit your online account page [http://ww2.operationsmile.org/account/](http://ww2.operationsmile.org/account/).

You have the right to request us to update your personal information in the event it is incorrect or out dated. You can do this by contacting [\[email protected\]](https://www.operationsmile.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or calling 1-888-OPSMILE (1- 888-677-6453).

### THIRD PARTY REQUESTS TO CHANGE DATA

Except in exceptional circumstances (as outlined in this process) requests to change user information including changes to direct debits, standing orders or any other kind of donation, can only be authorized by the user. We can only take instructions from a third party with the express consent of the user or on evidence of the relevant power of attorney. This is to safeguard the interests of the user with whom we have a relationship.

A request by a third party to remove a user from our mailing list or change mailing preferences may be considered exceptionally if we are convinced the third party is acting in the best interests of the user. This may be a judgment based on the user’s history of giving, any unusual changes in the level of their giving or frequency of giving and any communication we have had with the user regarding their gifts or mailing preferences. Any direct communication from the user (verbal or written) which gives concern that the user may lack capacity to make a sound decision and/or judgment could be taken as support on this. In this context our telemarketing agencies who call on our behalf in fundraising campaigns record conversations with prospective users and where there is a concern relating to mental capacity these recordings could be used by Operation Smile for final decision making.

### IS MY INFORMATION SECURE?

Keeping your personal information secure is a top priority for Operation Smile. Personal information is private and confidential; accordingly, the information provided is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated employees, trained in the proper handling of customer information, and is used only for the purpose for which the information is collected.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling donation receipts and sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Whenever Operation Smile should hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and allow us to audit them for compliance.

### CREDIT CARD INFORMATION SECURITY

At Operation Smile, we sincerely care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use high grade encryption and the HTTPS security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Companies we work with to process credit card transactions also use high grade encryption and security protocols. Contributions may also be made by calling 1-888-OPSMILE (1- 888-677-6453).

### PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY

Operation Smile employs error checking procedures to make sure certain transactions are processed completely and accurately. As necessary, changes are made to improve our systems. And, independent external and internal audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site. During business hours, staff is available to answer questions about your financial donation or personal information at 1-888-OPSMILE (1- 888-677-6453).

Operation Smile sites and affiliated digital properties are based and operated in the United States.

By creating content about Operation Smile or from any of our medical programs, you agree to the following policies.

* Above all else, you will respect the privacy and dignity of our patients.
* Your posts will not be discriminatory, offensive, hateful, defamatory or otherwise illegal.
* Your posts will be culturally sensitive.

* You will obtain informed, verbal consent prior to capturing images of patients, volunteers or Operation Smile staff, and be clear about the way that you will use their image and information.
* You will not publish patients’ personal information, including their last names.
* You will not publish images of patients who look uncomfortable, frightened or in pain.  
* You will not publish images of patients who are having their blood drawn, being intubated or extubated, or who have blood around their stitching, face and or medical gown.
* You will not post patient PIT photos. These are photos are part of a patient’s medical records.  
* You will not post immediate post-operative photos of patients.  
* You will respect the privacy patients who are undergoing anesthesia or who are waking up from anesthesia.
* You will respect the privacy of patients who are partially clothed or unclothed.
* You will be mindful of the words used in your post. You will not refer to a patient as a “cleft patient.” Say instead, “a patient born with a cleft condition” or something similar. In posts, do not refer to their cleft condition as a “deformity.” While this may be a medical term, our patients have told us they do not appreciate this word being used casually. Think about how you contribute to patient dignity and respect.
* You understand that Operation Smile provides “renewed hope,” not “hope”; “new smiles,” not “smiles” and will use the appropriate language. You agree to refer to “patients with cleft conditions” (or another variant), never “cleft patients.” You agree to reference “developing countries,” never “third-world.” You agree to use “cleft condition” or “cleft lip and cleft palate,” never “deformities,” “defect” or “malformation.”
* Our name is Operation Smile and must appear in the same type style, color and size as the surrounding text. It may not be emphasized by underlining, increasing its size or setting the font appearance to bold or italic. Publicly, we’re “Operation Smile,” never “OpSmile” or “OSI” or “OS” or another variant.
* You will not publish images of patients who have poor lip revision scars. Often, these patients did not receive surgical care from our medical teams, and without the proper context, this could be a poor reflection of our work. You will not criticize the work of other surgical organizations.
* You will not post political views or discuss political issues within any host country.  
* You will not post your travel itinerary.  
* You will not post your personal opinions of other Operation Smile staff or volunteers.  
* You will not post inappropriate photos of yourself, team members or patients that may be perceived as unprofessional, culturally insensitive or offensive, or violating a patient’s right to privacy.  
* You will check-in during emergency situations.
