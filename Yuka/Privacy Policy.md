Information on opting out of interest-based advertising
-------------------------------------------------------

In addition to any opt-out feature provided by any of the services listed in this document, Users may follow the instructions provided by [YourOnlineChoices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (EU), the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/) (US) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/consumers/) (US), [DAAC](http://youradchoices.ca/understanding-online-advertising) (Canada), [DDAI](http://www.ddai.info/optout) (Japan) or other similar initiatives. Such initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.

Further information about the processing of Personal Data
---------------------------------------------------------

* * ### Unique device identification
        
        Yuka may track Users by storing a unique identifier of their device, for analytics purposes or for storing Users' preferences.
        
    * ### Rights for registered California Users under the age of 18
        
        California's "Online Eraser" law, part of California's Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services targeting minors to allow registered Users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of content they post.
        
        If a registered User fits that description and posted content on Yuka, they may request removal of such content by contacting the Owner or its privacy policy coordinator at the contact details provided in this document.
        
        In response to this request, the Owner may make content posted by the registered User invisible to other registered Users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content may remain on the Owner's servers. It may also be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted this content.
        
    * ### Push notifications
        
        Yuka may send push notifications to the User to achieve the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
        
        Users may in most cases opt-out of receiving push notifications by visiting their device settings, such as the notification settings for mobile phones, and then change those settings for Yuka, some or all of the apps on the particular device. Users must be aware that disabling push notifications may negatively affect the utility of Yuka.
        
    * ### The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13
        
        Users declare themselves to be adult according to their applicable legislation. Minors may use Yuka only with the assistance of a parent or guardian. Under no circumstance persons under the age of 13 may use Yuka.

* ### Unique device identification
    
    Yuka may track Users by storing a unique identifier of their device, for analytics purposes or for storing Users' preferences.
    
* ### Rights for registered California Users under the age of 18
    
    California's "Online Eraser" law, part of California's Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services targeting minors to allow registered Users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of content they post.
    
    If a registered User fits that description and posted content on Yuka, they may request removal of such content by contacting the Owner or its privacy policy coordinator at the contact details provided in this document.
    
    In response to this request, the Owner may make content posted by the registered User invisible to other registered Users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content may remain on the Owner's servers. It may also be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted this content.
    
* ### Push notifications
    
    Yuka may send push notifications to the User to achieve the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
    
    Users may in most cases opt-out of receiving push notifications by visiting their device settings, such as the notification settings for mobile phones, and then change those settings for Yuka, some or all of the apps on the particular device. Users must be aware that disabling push notifications may negatively affect the utility of Yuka.
    
* ### The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13
    
    Users declare themselves to be adult according to their applicable legislation. Minors may use Yuka only with the assistance of a parent or guardian. Under no circumstance persons under the age of 13 may use Yuka.

* provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
* processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;

* processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

### Further information about retention time

Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal obligation or based on the Users’ consent.

#### Details about the right to object to processing

**Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.**

**Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.**

#### How to exercise these rights

Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in this document. Such requests are free of charge and will be answered by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month, providing Users with the information required by law. Any rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing will be communicated by the Owner to each recipient, if any, to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.
