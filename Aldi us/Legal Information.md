Information We Collect
----------------------

We collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Services and sometimes from third parties. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” or “personal data”, and some of which may be considered “sensitive”, under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, phone number, e-mail address, etc.), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal information so that it is non-personal, either by combining it with information about other individuals and/or by hashing the information or otherwise removing characteristics that make the information personally identifiable to you. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements.

We may ask you to provide personal information when you interact with us, including contact information and other personal information, payment information (for example, credit card or gift card information), demographic information (for example, your gender, age or similar information), and other information as set forth below. Certain features on our Services may also collect personal information about your preferences and interests. We may also collect personal information from you when you interact with our customer service team, whether by phone, email, webform submission or physical mail, or if you respond to our text messages.

Information We Collect By Automated Means
-----------------------------------------

When you visit or otherwise interact with our Services, we and partners may collect certain “Usage Information” by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, web server logs, image pixels, web beacons and JavaScript (collectively referred to as “**Tracking Technologies**”). Usage Information may include your device IP address or other unique device identifier, web browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, clickstream data, and dates and times of website visits. In some cases, we may directly collect location information through your device. You may be able to turn off the collection of location information through the settings on your device.

We use the following types of Tracking Technologies to automatically collect information when you interact with us online:  

**Cookies and Local Storage.** A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. These technologies may be used for many purposes by us, our service providers, and our third-party business partners, such as automatically collecting Usage Information, enabling features, serving advertisements to you online, and remembering your preferences. We may use cookies and other technologies to help keep your use of the Services more secure, to study traffic patterns on the Services, to study the effectiveness of our customer communications, to maintain the integrity of the Services, to measure crash analytics and other maintenance related information, to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Services, and to personalize your experience through the Services, such as to recognize you when you return to the Services. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser, or depending on your location, via settings we make available on our Services. You can find more information about cookies and how they work at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**Web Beacons.** Web Beacons (also known as clear GIFs and pixel tags) are small pieces of code used to collect usage analytics.  They help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish when an email is opened.

**Embedded Scripts.** An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with our Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily used by our server or a third-party service provider or business partner while you browse or interact with our Services and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from our Services.

**Software Development Kits (SDKs).** An SDK is a software package that contains a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps. These tools can be used to create and operate features that collect information from your device. 

**Mobile Applications.** When you use our mobile applications (“**Apps**”), we also may collect certain information by automated means, such as through device logs, server logs and other technologies. The information we collect in this manner may include the device type used, the mobile operating system and version, device identifiers and similar unique identifiers such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, device settings and configurations, IP addresses, battery and signal strength, mobile network information, usage statistics, referring emails and web addresses, dates and times of usage, actions taken on the Apps and other information regarding use of the Apps. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes. We may also collect your mobile device’s geolocation information. With your permission, we may receive the precise geolocation and other location information of your mobile device through GPS, Bluetooth and WiFi signals, and other technologies to provide you with the Apps, facilitate online orders and offer you personalized coupons and other offers. Your device’s operating platform may provide you with a notification when the App attempts to collect your precise geolocation. Please note that if you do not allow the App to collect your precise geolocation, you may not be able to use all the Apps’ features or the offers available through the Apps. However, also note that we may still be able to collect or infer your approximate location through other information we collect, such as IP address. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Services.

ALDI may record session interactions with Service user interfaces, including what pages you visit on the Services, how long you visit those pages, the links you click, and your path through the Services, for website analytics purposes, solely for our internal business purposes, to improve the Services and our products and services.

[Back to Top](#c831931)

Information We Collect From Third Parties About You
---------------------------------------------------

We may receive information about you from third parties, such as business partners (including companies that assist us with online advertising and analytics), data providers who enhance the information we have about you, sources of publicly available information, our parent company, affiliates and subsidiaries, and other users of the Services (such as when they provide your information to send you one of our products or participate in a “refer a friend” or similar programs that we may offer). And we may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties, such as public databases, publicly available Social Media pages, and third parties who enhance the information we have about you.

We use this information to better provide you with information and products, to tailor our content and the offers we show you, and for other business purposes.  

**_Social Media Interactions:_** We may facilitate interactions with social media platforms, like Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram. You may also have the opportunity to log in through or otherwise connect your social media account. When you interact with social media through the Services, we will receive information about you from the social media service and you will be choosing to share information about your interactions with ALDI with that social media service.

In addition, the social media service may set their own cookies and collect information about your use of the Services, including your IP address or other device identifiers, and which pages you visit on the Services. These social media platforms may be able to collect certain information on your visits to the Services regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the social media platform. If you are logged out or do not have an account and visit a page with a social plug-in, your browser sends a more limited set of information. Like other sites, the social media platform will receive information about the webpage you are visiting, the date and time of your visit, and other browser-related information. They may use that information to help them improve their products or for other purposes set forth in their privacy policy. We may also receive information about you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or "friends."

The information we collect is subject to this U.S. Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature but may retain the information previously collected.

If you choose to post information to a third-party platform, that information may be public.

[Back to Top](#c831931)

How We Use The Information We Obtain

We may use non-personal information for any purpose allowable by law, including for advertising, research, and marketing purposes. We use information collected from or about you, including personal information and Usage Information, as disclosed in this U.S. Privacy Policy, including to:

Third Party Advertising & Analytics
-----------------------------------

ALDI works with third party business partners (such as network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics providers, and other advertising partners) to serve ALDI ads online, to serve third party ads on the Services, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons), and they may otherwise collect or have access to Usage Information and other information about you, some of which may be personal information under various state laws. Some of these parties may collect personal information over time when you visit the Services or other online websites and services. We may share information, typically information that has been hashed or otherwise de-identified or pseudonymized (including hashed email addresses), Usage Information, and location information, with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other third parties for the purpose of serving you more relevant ads on and off the Services.

We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to [https://policies.google.com/privacy/google-partners](https://policies.google.com/privacy/google-partners), and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We may use a variety of companies to serve our advertisements. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and you may want to visit the following webpages, which provide “opt-out” mechanisms for participating companies: [https://optout.networkadvertising.org](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/).

Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking advertising and/or analytics. In addition, the digital advertising industry has provided the ability for mobile users to register their intent not to receive targeted advertising at [http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices).

Please note opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising and you will continue to receive generic ads while online.

**Other California Privacy Rights**

California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27) allows California residents to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as ALDI does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt in or opt out) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marking purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice.  As stated in this U.S. Privacy Policy, ALDI provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at the time we offer that choice, we do not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please write to us at ALDI Inc. Attention:  Customer Service 1200 N. Kirk Rd. Batavia, IL 60510, or call **1-833-602-2534**. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address.
