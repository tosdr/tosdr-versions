 **Privacy Notice**

**_Effective Date: July 1, 2023_**

**Darden Global Privacy Statement**

Darden is based in the U.S., and its collection and use of Personal Information is processed subject to U.S. Data Protection laws. Personal Information is information that identifies you or reasonably can be linked to information that identifies you. For example, when you place an order online, to fulfill your order, we collect personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information. Some laws define “personal information” differently, and we use those definitions when they are applicable.

Darden does not store data collected through our websites or mobile apps in any location outside of the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union (“EU”) or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, by providing your Personal Information on our websites or mobile apps, you are acknowledging that such collection may occur and expressly grant permission to do so. Darden will take appropriate steps to ensure that your Personal Information is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Policy (the “Notice”).

Please note that this Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee, Domestic or International. For more information on Franchised Operators and Licensees, please visit [https://franchisedarden.com/](https://franchisedarden.com/) for more information.

**Your Privacy** 

Our Notice describes the information we collect from and about you during your visit to our online interfaces (including websites, mobile applications, social media, or other digital channels), via your in-restaurant interactions, and through your interaction with in-restaurant devices owned or controlled by us (collectively, the “Sites”). It also describes how we use information about you and with whom we disclose it. This Notice applies only to those Darden interfaces that link directly to this Notice.

The terms "we," "our," and "us" in this Notice refer to Darden and its family of companies. It's important to know that our websites or mobile apps may contain links to third-party sites not controlled by Darden or covered by this Notice. We recommend that you check the privacy statements of other sites you visit before providing any Personal Information.

**What Information Is Collected and How Is It Collected?**

**Personal Information We Collect**

We may collect Personal Information about you from a variety of ways depending on how you interact with our restaurants, websites, or mobile services. This information includes:

·       Personal Identifiers such as name, address, phone number (including mobile), email address, and username and password to access Darden products and online services;   

·       Other Personal Identifiers such as names, postal addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers of others to whom you ask us to send information;

·       Demographic Information such as date of birth, marital status, family structures, educational levels, employment status, household income and dwelling, and characteristics of protected classifications under state or federal law, such as gender, race, and military status;

·       Financial Information such as payment card details, financial account information, billing address, and home mortgage.

·       Internet/Network Information such as Internet Protocol (IP) Address and/or domain, internet service provider, internet click activity on our websites or mobile apps, analytics data, browsing history, and search history;

·       Commercial Information such as online order and reservation history, records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies;

·       Geo-location information of your computer or mobile device, such as your city, state, province, and country. When you access the mobile app, we may collect precise geo-location information if you permit the app to access such information so that we may provide you with directions based on your location and proximity to the nearest Darden family restaurant;  

·       Audio/Video information, such as CCTV images, photograph; and

·       Other Personal Information you may provide to us, such as comments, chats, opinions, and mobile carrier.

**How We Collect Information**

We may collect your Personal Information provided directly by you or a member of your household when you:

·       Create an account on one of our websites or mobile services;

·       Place an in-person or on-line to go order, or other transaction, with us;

·       Enable your Geolocation services;

·       Make a payment for products or services;

·       Participate in our eClub or any loyalty programs;

·       Make a reservation;

·       Purchase a Gift Card;

·       Participate in promotional sweepstakes;

·       Provide feedback or participate in a survey;

·       Contact us with a question or request; and

·       “Like,” “Follow” or otherwise connect with or post to one of our Social Media Pages.

We may collect your Personal Information from a device associated with you or your household:

·       Desktop Information:  We collect technical information when you visit our websites or services. This may include information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device operating system and browser type, a unique device identifier, the address of referring websites, the path you take through our websites, and other information about your session on our websites.

·       Mobile Information:  When you use or access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location. If you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number, as well as any other Personal Information specified by the App in its terms or notices.

·       Geolocation information: We may collect or infer information about your general or precise location when you access or use the Services, visit our restaurants or support center, or turn on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other geolocation functionality on your device.

·       Device-Based Advertising:  We may also use device information, particularly in mobile advertising, to help deliver our ads and measure ad campaign effectiveness. Darden and the companies we work with may collect some certain information when you visit one of our sites or see our ads. Compiling and comparing this information creates a unique ID for individual devices and can be "matched" to the same information on other sites or mobile applications. Some companies we work with are also able to associate related devices into households based on common characteristics, such as IP addresses.

·       Device Usage Research:  We may participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op. This helps us understand how you use our website and apps across your devices so that we can better tailor promotions to you.  

We may collect your Personal Information using automated technologies:

·       Cookies:  We use a variety of technologies, including cookies, to collect information about your online/mobile activity when you visit our site(s). Cookies are small text files that a website server stores on your computer or device. They’re typically used to remember your account login preferences, monitor website traffic, provide customer support like live chat, and help us better customize our site for your individual preferences.

·       Pixels/Beacons:  We or third-party ad servers, including Facebook, may use cookies or invisible pixels or beacons on our websites or mobile apps to count how many users visit certain pages or take certain actions to collect or receive information from our websites, mobile apps and elsewhere on the Internet. We may use this information to improve our marketing programs and content and target advertisements on this website and/or other sites.

·       Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA):  There are ways we use OBA on third-party websites and mobile apps that are not affiliated with Darden.

·       Interest-Based Advertising:  The third parties we contract with may use cookies or other technologies to gather interest-based information to customize the ads you see. This information may be combined and linked with data from other sources. Neither the third parties nor Darden collects any Personal Information through these cookies. We may also use aggregate data to display ads or content that may interest you.

Darden has adopted the use of the AdChoices Icon (also known as the Advertising Options Icon) on our interest-based advertising (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). You can learn more about AdChoices by visiting [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) to learn more and control whether or not you receive this type of advertising from participating companies.

·       Do Not Track Signals:  We do not respond to Web browser "Do Not Track" signals at this time. To prevent us or third parties from tracking, you can access your browser settings and disable or delete your cookies.

·       Link to Websites:  The Services may have links to other websites and other services that we do not operate or maintain. We have no control over how these websites may collect your information, and we are not responsible for the practices, policies, and security measures implemented on these websites.

We may collect your Personal Information from our Darden family of restaurants such as:

·       Olive Garden

·       LongHorn Steakhouse

·       Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen

·       Yard House

·       The Capital Grille

·       The Capital Burger

·       Seasons 52

·       Bahama Breeze

·       Eddie V's.

·       Ruth’s Chris

We may collect your Personal Information from other sources:

·       Third Parties:  We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you from third-party sources from whom we collect or purchase Personal Information in order to enhance our ability to serve you, tailor content to you, and offer you products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we received from those sources with the information provided directly by you.

·       Vendors:  Our vendors may disclose your Personal Information to us. For example, if you order food or catering, order gift cards, make a purchase for merchandise, make a payment, or provide feedback on your experiences, you may submit Personal Information to one or more vendors that may disclose your information to us.  Our vendors may also receive information from geolocation data providers to help us understand aggregate visit patterns in restaurant markets of interest, but these providers get the location data from sources other than our own apps and websites.   Additionally, for certain features of the online services, you may log in through your third-party social media account or share content from the online Services through third-party social media platforms. When you submit information to a third party, you are subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policies, for which we are not responsible.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

We collect and use your Personal Information for the following purposes:

·       Create and manage your account;

·       Offer and provide products and services to you;

·       Process and collect payments for goods and services;

·       Communicate about, and administer your participation in special events, programs, rewards, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, and other offers or promotions;

·       For targeted advertising and marketing services;

·       Send information to others if you ask us to do so;

·       Respond to and communicate with you about your requests, concerns, questions, and comments;

·       Operate, evaluate, and improve our business;

·       Perform data analyses;

·       Protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims, and other liabilities;

·       Collect location data to enable check-in notification for curbside to-go orders when you arrive at the restaurant, even when the app is closed or not in use; and

·       Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, and our policies.

We comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, and our policies. For example, we may use the information you provide when you complete an online order, transaction, or reservation. When you sign up with our eClub or rewards and provide us with your contact information, we may also use that information to contact you with news and special offers.

To the extent permitted by applicable law and with your consent where required, we also use information collected through automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users’ visits to our site, (ii) delivering content (including advertising) tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users browse our site, and (iii) managing our site and other aspects of our business. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may use this information to provide you with ads about our products when you browse this and other websites or use our mobile apps.

**How Your Personal Information Is Disclosed**

·       Darden Family:   We may disclose your Personal Information within the Darden family of restaurants. The Darden Family currently includes Darden, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, The Capital Grille, The Capital Burger, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, and Eddie V's, as well as our affiliates and subsidiaries. Members of the Darden family who receive this information from us are not authorized to use or disclose the information except as set out in this privacy statement.

·       Third Parties:  In order to serve you, we disclose your Personal Information to service providers or third parties that perform functions on our behalf.  We may disclose your Personal Information with vendors or third parties who provide services to us, such as fulfilling orders, facilitating reservations, providing data processing and other information technology services, managing promotions, managing any rewards programs, surveys, contests, prize draws, and sweepstakes, carrying out research and analysis, and personalizing individual Darden customer experiences. We do not allow these vendors to use this information or to disclose it for any purpose other than as allowed by law or to provide services on our behalf or on an aggregated basis for statistical, benchmarking, or other analytical services.

As permitted by law, we also disclose information collected about you with companies with whom we have formal agreements to conduct analysis, engage in customer research, benchmarking, and improve our products or services.

We may decide to sell or transfer all or part of our business for strategic or other business reasons. As part of that sale or transfer, we may pass the information we have collected and stored, including Personal Information, to anyone involved in the sale or transfer.

·       Compliance With Laws:  We may disclose your Personal Information and other information to third parties, including governmental authorities, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Darden, our customers, or the public as required or permitted by law (especially in emergency situations).

**Your Choices and Rights**

·       Changing or Updating Your Personal Information:  You may request that any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information held by us or on our behalf is corrected by contacting [privacy@darden.com](mailto:privacy@darden.com) or as set forth under "How Can You Contact Us?" below.

o    If you use our mobile applications that collect your device’s precise location, you can change preferences on your mobile device to prevent the apps from collecting that information. If you do, you may lose some mobile apps features, such as locating the nearest restaurant from your current location.

**How We Retain Your Personal Information**

We will retain your Personal Information for the purposes for which the information was collected, as outlined in this Notice. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to manage your relationship with us, personalize and improve your overall customer experience, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this Statement.

 

**How We Safeguard Your Personal Information**

We will take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide us from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure your information. Unfortunately, no security system is 100% secure, thus, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you provide to us via the Services.

**How We Protect Children’s Privacy Online**

We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information about children under the age of 13 unless the Personal Information is provided by a parent, legal guardian, or authorized adult. Our websites or mobile apps are not intended for children under 13. If we learn that the online Services have received Personal Information directly from a child who is under the age of 13, we will delete the information in accordance with applicable law. Visit the Federal Trade Commission website for more information on the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

**Notice to Nevada Residents**

Nevada residents have the right to submit a verified request directing us not to sell their Personal Information. If you are a Nevada resident and would like to submit such a request, please send your request to [privacy@darden.com](mailto:privacy@darden.com)

**Your California Consumer Rights**

If you are a California resident, the processing of your Personal Information may be subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and you may have certain rights with respect to that information.  In order to exercise some of these rights, you must submit a verifiable consumer request.  The verifiable consumer request must:

·       Provide sufficient information that allows us to verify, to a reasonably high degree of certainty, that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information. This may include requesting that you provide us with at least two or more pieces of Personal Information to match against Personal Information about you that we may or may not maintain and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verification.

·       Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it properly.

We cannot honor certain requests or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. You may request any or all of this information up to two times in a 12-month period.

You may also make a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request on behalf of your minor child.

If you wish to have an Authorized Agent make a request on your behalf, they will need to provide us with sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your Authorized Agent, and we will still require you to provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information.

**The Right to Know**

You have the right to request access to Personal Information collected about you and information regarding the source of that Personal Information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we disclose it.

**The Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information Processing**

Darden uses and discloses sensitive personal information only for purposes permitted under California law.  We therefore do not offer a right to limit the use and disclosure of such information.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
