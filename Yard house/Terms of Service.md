**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:**

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU SEND OR RECEIVE DURING YOUR USE OF THE SITES MAY NOT BE SECURE AND MAY BE INTERCEPTED BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES.

THIS DISCLAIMER APPLIES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY ARISING FROM ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECTS, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUSES, FILE CORRUPTION, COMMUNICATION-LINE FAILURE, NETWORK OR SYSTEM OUTAGE, YOUR LOSS OF PROFITS, OR THEFT, DESTRUCTION, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OF, LOSS OR USE OF ANY RECORD OR DATA, AND ANY OTHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE LOSS.

**INDEMNIFICATION:**

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Darden and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, service providers, subcontractors and suppliers from and against any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising or resulting from your use of the Sites and any violation of these Terms of Use. If you cause a technical disruption of the Sites or the systems transmitting the Sites to you or others, you agree to be responsible for any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising or resulting from that disruption. Darden reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with Darden in the defense of such matter.

**JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW:**

Unless your state provides broader rights, the laws of the State of Florida govern these Terms of Use and your use of the Sites, and you irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the County of Orange for any legal proceeding, claim, arbitration, or action arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use. We recognize that it is possible for you to obtain access to the Sites from any jurisdiction in the world, but we have no practical ability to prevent such access. The Sites have been designed to comply with state and federal law of the United States. If any material on the Sites, or your use of the Sites, is contrary to the laws of the place where you are when you access it, the Sites are not intended for you, and we ask you not to use the Sites. You are responsible for informing yourself of the laws of your jurisdiction and complying with them.

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION; AGREEMENT TO MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTION:**

These Terms create a binding contract between you and us and are considered a transaction in interstate commerce.  As such, the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the US Code) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.  Any issue concerning the validity or enforcement of this arbitration provision, or whether it applies to any specific claim or dispute will be determined by the arbitrators.

You agree that by accessing and using our Site(s) or agreeing to these Terms, you and Company are each waiving the right to trial by jury and the ability to participate in a class action. We will work with you in good faith to resolve any issue you have with Company of our Site, including interaction with any functionality of the Site or with products and services ordered or purchased through the Site, if you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department.

In the absence of such a resolution, any and all disputes Company has or you have relating in any way to your relationship with the Company (including without limitation with respect to your transactions with the Company, your use of our Site(s), your interaction with any functionality of the Site(s), Company's advertisements and disclosures, email and mobile SMS (text) messages Company sends to you, the use or disclosure of any information about you, these Terms, privacy notices, or other terms of use) will be submitted to confidential binding mandatory arbitration in the city or county in which you reside, except to the extent that you have, in any way, violated or threatened to violate any Company intellectual property right. The parties agree all hearings and proceedings in connection with the arbitration shall be conducted telephonically (or commonly used online communication service), unless either party believes there is a compelling reason to hold one or more hearings in person.  If an in person hearing is scheduled, the parties agree to request the arbitrator to schedule the hearing in the city or county where you reside, and an alternative arbitrator may be appointed for this purpose if necessary. Claims required to be submitted to and resolved in binding mandatory arbitration include claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or the Company's negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other source of law.

If you intend to seek arbitration, you  must first send to the Company, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("**Notice**"). The Notice to Company should be mailed to:

Attention: Legal  
1000 Darden Center Drive  
Orlando FL 32837

The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought. The parties agree to discuss and cooperate in good faith to resolve the dispute for a minimum resolution period of thirty (30) days (the “**Resolution Period**”) after Company’s receipt of the Notice.  We realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a customer's satisfaction. If after using good faith efforts, you and we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within the Resolution Period, you or we may commence arbitration.

All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the applicable Arbitration rules (e.g., Commercial or Consumer Arbitration Rules, whichever is applicable or more applicable) of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules to the extent applicable. Additional information regarding the AAA, its procedures, rules, and filing fees can be found at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). The arbitrator's award is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration brought under, or with respect to, claims is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless permitted by the applicable rules and Company and You agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.

The filing fee(s) for the arbitration shall be paid and allocated in accordance with the current AAA rules, including the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules to the extent applicable. Either party may request a Process Arbitrator with respect to the dispute(s) and claim(s).  Company agrees to pay all Initiation Fees, Per Case Fees, and other filing fees that it is legally or contractually required to pay.  Unless provided for otherwise by the applicable law or rules, or the arbitrator, Company will pay its and you will pay your, lawyers', experts', and witness fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims.

**YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** To the extent permitted by law, you will not agree to act as a representative or a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or participate as a member of a class of claimants in any lawsuit against Company in any court, or in arbitration, with respect to any program claims. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. This section (confidential arbitration) will survive the termination of the relationship between you and Company.

If this agreement to arbitration and waiver of class action is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts located in and for Orange County, Florida.

**NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS COMPANY LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.**

**CHANGES TO THESE TERMS OF USE:**

Darden reserves the right in its sole discretion to change, modify, add or remove any portion of these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time, by posting revised terms on the relevant Sites. There is no duty on Darden to send you additional methods of notice of changes. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we make to the Terms. Your continued use of the Sites after that point signifies that you accept the changes.

**ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND ADMISSIBILITY:**

This agreement and any policies or operating rules posted on the Sites constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and Darden with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. A printed version of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based on or relating to use of the Sites to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

**SEVERABILITY:**

If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the agreement will remain in place.

**HOW TO CONTACT US:**

If you have any questions or comments about these Terms or the Sites, please contact us by emailing us at: [iplaw@darden.com](mailto:iplaw@darden.com)
