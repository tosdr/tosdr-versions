### 5\. Use of Cookies

Like many commercial websites, we analyze how visitors use our Site with “cookie” technology. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you access our website and allows us to recognize you each time you visit the website. We may use cookies to (1) enhance or personalize your website usage and experience; (2) monitor website usage; and (3) improve the website and our services, including providing you with interest-based ads.  We may work with service providers that help us track, collect and analyze this information.  We may combine the information we collect through cookies with other information we have collected from you or information from other sources. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual cookies or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions.  Please refer to your browser instructions or to www.aboutcookies.org to learn more about how to adjust of modify your browser settings.  However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features on our website. Please note that browser-management tools for cookies are outside of our control, and we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. Many advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members, visit [https://youradchoices.com/](https://youradchoices.com/ "Go to website YourAdChoices.com"), and [https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices "Go to website AboutAds.info") for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see [https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "Go to website NetworkAdvertising.org").

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit [https://www.allaboutdnt.com](https://www.allaboutdnt.com/ "Go to website AllAboutDNT.com"), but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information.
