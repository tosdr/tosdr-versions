**13.** **PRODUCT DATA**

There are various forms of data that are generated and collected from your use of products. Reasonable efforts are made to encrypt or encode Personal Data where we know it is present in Product Data.

Broadly, the data generated and collected from your use of products can be categorised as follows:

**13.1. Data Types: In-Product Analytics**

We analyse behaviour patterns in order to develop product improvements. Such data is exclusively used in order to improve our Services. Adaptavist Group Ltd may capture information such as the page that is viewed, the referrer, or the actions performed (such as a clicked button). Note that:

\- IP addresses may be supplied and in some cases can be resolved to a person, which would render them Personal Data.

\- In some cases, We track the software instance that data comes from. In the Atlassian context, this ties to an Enablement ID or a SEN number.

\- You can also set your firewall to disallow (block) this traffic.

**13.2. Data Types: Diagnostic Data (Error Logs data)**

Our Cloud Apps track errors of our Cloud Apps' resources executed in the end users' browsers in real-time. This includes for example AddOnKey, ClientKey, BaseUrl, anonymised TrackingID, error messages and information about the environment such as browser type, browser version and operating system. It is exclusively used in order to improve our service.

Additionally, web services hosted in our own infrastructure log information, warning and error messages that may contain information about specific web requests or actions taken as part of a Cloud App's usage. AddOnKey, ClientKey, BaseUrl, AccountId and other context specific information including references to entities within Jira Cloud or Confluence Cloud are included. These logs are stored for 90 days (or as specified in the applicable product technical documentation at [https://docs.adaptavist.com/](https://docs.adaptavist.com/)) and are used for diagnostic and service improvement purposes only.

Errors from JavaScript in our cloud applications are sent to Sentry to alert Adaptavist Group Ltd support. The data sent to Sentry includes organisational data but no individual data. Sentry is running in browser and will diagnose issues. An End User’s IP address is included in the data sent to Sentry, and this in theory can be traced to an individual user (and hence may be considered Personal Data).

In addition, by seeking product support, you may provide log and other information, voluntarily, to our Support staff for analysis and review. It is possible that this can contain Personal Data depending on how you use and configure your products and systems. Application logs may be sent to sub-processors or stored.

**13.2.1 Log and supplied information**

This is information given voluntarily by a client to our support staff by a client. In theory, this could contain Personal Data embedded within user generated content. This depends on how the client manages Personal Data.

Some of this data may be processed and stored on Adaptavist Group Ltd’s AWS based servers.

**13.2.2 General Diagnostics**

This includes error detection and alerting data. Sentry is running in browser and will diagnose issues. An End User’s IP address is included in the data sent to Sentry, and this can at times be resolved to an individual, which means it can be Personal Data.

This information is sent to Sentry for processing and storage. Depending on configuration, information may also be sent to Slack as there is a slack add-on for notifications.

**13.2.3 Aggregated Diagnostics and Session Data**

This includes data from each customer’s use of products, for example, usage statistics of product functionality such as the total number of product functions used per day. This data is anonymised. Therefore, we cannot identify the end user this data relates to.

Datadog is used for monitoring synthesized values and metrics such as those outlined above, or CPU usage and requests per second.

**13.2.4 Metrics**

Application metrics are sent to Datadog or AWS for analysis and reporting in order for us to monitor the application’s performance. This will include anonymised organisational data and aggregated data, but no Personal Data by design.

**13.3. Data Types: General Data**

This includes user generated or configured content or data such as scripts or configuration of cloud based products.

We store customer scripts for specific Cloud Apps such as ScriptRunner for Jira Cloud, Enhanced Search (JQL and Subqueries), ScriptRunner Connect, ScriptRunner for Confluence Cloud, as well as queries (encrypted), inside our own infrastructure hosted on AWS and managed and operated by Adaptavist Group Ltd. There may be a few exceptions where, for example, select low-risk ScriptRunner Cloud data is still hosted on Jira Cloud (Atlassian) storage.

By design there is normally no Personal Data contained in this data category, though an end user may at their choice configure the products otherwise.

**13.4. Data Types: Administrative data**

If you are using our Hosted Services for Atlassian Cloud products, we may have access to data available to an administrator based on the specific applications scopes granted (please see [https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/atlassian-connect-app-scopes-445186491.html](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/atlassian-connect-app-scopes-445186491.html) for more information on application scopes). Access to this information is strictly controlled and will only be used for specific application functionality which requires it and support services such as initial configuration, routine maintenance such as backups and changes to server configuration and also any bespoke content production or alterations We make upon your request.

In addition, [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) will have to retain a copy of your contact details and license key of the Atlassian products for their own records, along with any correspondence you may have with them directly.

**13.5. Data Types: Personal Profile Data**

Integrated Partners such as Atlassian have very specific ways of defining Personal Data. For Atlassian, this includes data held in a specific set of tables and for a narrow purpose of logically identifying users. Such data may also be processed by service providers such as AWS Cognito or Auth0 or Clerk in order to enable profile related product features for Adaptavist Group Ltd offerings.

This data does not include information which may still resolve to an individual (i.e. Personal Data within the definition prescribed by the GDPR) and which may be embedded in content throughout various applications.

In order to ensure we harmonise in certain instances with our Integrated Partners from a policy standpoint, we recognise this distinctive category of data as Personal Profile Data.

**13.6. On-premises products versus Hosted Services (including Cloud Apps)**

Adaptavist Group Ltd provides on-premises products for which you can acquire a license to use. Use of such products is governed by the [Adaptavist End User License Agreement](https://www.theadaptavistgroup.com/policy/adaptavist-eula). On-premises products include Atlassian-based "Server" and "Data Center" variants of our products. These products, by their nature, will be installed in an environment that a client controls.

Adaptavist Group Ltd also provides hosted products for Atlassian Cloud and in addition, Adaptavist Group Ltd provides products for Slack and Trello and other SaaS products including ScriptRunner Connect, apps for monday.com, and Venue.sh; all together, these are our "Cloud Apps" and Cloud Apps are part of "Hosted Services," which also contain other online services that may be made available by Adaptavist Group Ltd.

**Regarding Cloud Apps:**

For a further breakdown of how Personal Data may be processed, please see the [Data Processing Addendum](https://www.theadaptavistgroup.com/policy/dpa), which is included as part of this Privacy Policy.

**13.7. Hosted Services: Note on Slack apps**

When you install Slack apps created by Adaptavist Group Ltd into your Slack workspace, you acknowledge and understand that other users of your Slack workspace may be able to interact with Adaptavist and as such their Personal Data may be visible to Adaptavist Group Ltd. Adaptavist Group Ltd does not record, disseminate or share with third parties any personally identifiable data from other users of your workspace. However, statistical data (such as the number of users in the Slack workspace) is monitored for the purposes of improving, tracking and developing the software only.

**14\. INTERACTION DATA**

We collect Personal Data if you provide it voluntarily when you contact us (data that arises from interactions with us on the phone, by email, via the website or in other ways). This includes, but is not limited to, any information you may provide us through our website(s), through any communications you may have with any Adaptavist Group Ltd employee in the course of their employment, or through any social media platform. You warrant not to provide Adaptavist Group Ltd with any Special Category Data through such Interactions.

We use the Personal Data you provide to process your enquiries. The legal basis for data processing is the fulfilment of our legitimate interest in the proper processing of contact enquiries. The provision of Personal Data is necessary in order to be able to properly allocate enquiries. If you contact us in connection with an existing or upcoming contract with you (data generated by an actual order or sale of a product or service), data processing is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.

**15\. TRANSACTIONAL AND COMMERCE DATA**

Data regarding any orders / purchases for use of our Services is referred to as Transactional and Commerce Data. This includes (but is not limited to) orders / purchases of:

\- licenses to use our software (including products) in whatever form,

\- licenses to use 3rd party software, or services, sold through Adaptavist Group Ltd.

Transactional and Commerce Data may be provided to us via your placing an order on the phone, via our own online marketplace facilities, via 3rd party marketplace facilities such as the Atlassian Marketplace, our website, officially authorised 3rd party partners or representatives, or other sources.

When placing orders / making purchases, it is important to note and agree to any terms and conditions imposed by third parties, such as Service Providers with whom we may be working to facilitate the order or purchase.

We process the data to protect our legitimate interests in an optimised presentation of our offer and effective communication with you and interested parties, which prevail in the context of a balancing of interests. If you purchase an Adaptavist Group Ltd product that is integrated with third-party products, we process the data in order to fulfil the contract with you or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into the contract.

**16\. NEWSLETTER**

You can subscribe to our newsletter ("AdaptaNews") on a voluntary basis. After confirming your registration for the newsletter, you will receive interesting information about our services and products, etc., at the e-mail address you have provided. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter by contacting us. You can find the contact details in the [Legal Notice](https://www.adaptavist.com/impressum).

The Adaptnews contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a thumbnail image embedded in emails sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This facilitates a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Using the embedded pixel code, we can recognize whether and when an email was opened by a data subject and which links in the email were clicked by the data subject.

Such Personal Data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and evaluated by the data controller in order to optimise the newsletter subscription and to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.
