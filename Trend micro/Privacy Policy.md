                Crowdstrike provides effective cybersecurity through its cloud-native platform, but its pricing may stretch budgets, especially for organizations seeking cost-effective scalability through a true single platform

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Group Statement
---------------------------------------

**This Statement Covers Financial Year 1st January 2022 to 31st December 2022** 

This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and sets out the steps that Trend Micro has taken and is continuing to take to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our business or supply chain.

Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights and encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour all of which have in common one person depriving another of their liberty in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. Trend Micro has a zerotolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to putting effective systems and controls in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the business or our supply chain. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners. As part of our contracting processes, we include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone held in slavery or servitude and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards. This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalfin any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners.

**About Trend Micro:**

Trend Micro is engaged in designing and licensing security software and related services. Find out more at: [https://www.trendmicro.com/en\_gb/about.html](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_gb/about.html) 

**Supply Chain:**

Trend Micro and its operating affiliated companies take steps to verify, evaluate and address risks of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.

Due to the nature of our business, we deem ourselves to have a low risk of modern slavery in our business and supply chain, however, with our supplier selection and on-boarding procedure we do undertake appropriate due diligence establishing relationships of trust and integrity with our suppliers and enter into contracts in order to provide contractual commitments to be made by the companies involved.

**Our Policies:**

We operate a number of internal policies to ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner. The following policies are available to employees via our intranet and HR departments:

* _Recruitment policy.  
    _We have in place a robust recruitment process which clearly outlines the ethical stance that we take in relation to employee intake and treatment. 
* _Whistleblowing policy.  
    _We encourage all employees, customers, and suppliers to report any suspicions. We provide a confidential helpline to protect the identity of whistle-blowers. 
* _Code of Conduct.  
    _Our code encourages employees to do the right thing by clearly stating the actions and behaviour expected of them when representing the business. We strive to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when operating and managing our supply chain.

**Our Practices:**

We continue to embed the principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 through:

* Providing awareness training to our employees on the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and ensuring they are aware of the appropriate actions to take should they suspect a case of slavery of human trafficking.
* Ensuring that consideration of the modern slavery risks and prevention are an integral part of our policy review process.
* Taking consistent action to strengthen and sustain our zero-tolerance policy towards modern slavery.
