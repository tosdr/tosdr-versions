We may disclose your Personal Information to:

* Affiliated Entities. We may disclose your Personal Information within the Misfits Market family of companies which are under common ownership and/or control to provide the Services, operate our business, and enhance our Services and your customer experience. For example, Imperfect Foods is a subsidiary of Misfits Market, and Imperfect Foods may disclose Personal Information to, and receive Personal Information from, Misfits Market and its affiliates. Additionally, Personal Information collected by Imperfect Foods may be combined with Personal Information about Misfits Market customers, and that combined information may be used by both Misfits Market and Imperfect Foods to operate, provide, develop, and improve Imperfect Foods’ and Misfits Market’s products and services.
* Service Providers. We use select third-party vendors to enable us to operate our business and provide our Website and Services to you, as described in this Privacy Policy. These service providers provide a variety of services to us, including customer service, payment processing, shipping, sales, direct marketing (including via direct mail and TV), product design and development, data storage, security, fraud prevention, research, legal services, and other technical services to keep our Website running and safe, as well as to make our Services available to you. These service providers are permitted to access and use your Personal Information for purposes of performing services for Misfits Market or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
* Online Advertising Partners.  We may disclose your Personal Information to certain (i) online advertising and related analytics partners who perform certain types of targeted online advertising and other related services for us and (ii) direct marketing partners. For example, our online advertising partners may serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and analyze interactions with our advertisements.
* Entities for Business Transactions.  We may disclose your Personal Information to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us about our users is among the assets transferred.
* Entities for Legal Purposes.  We may disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement agencies, government officials, or other third parties if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for the purposes of (i) complying with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; (ii) preventing fraud and providing credit risk reduction; (iii) investigating potential unauthorized access or misuse of our Website or other breach of our [Terms of Service](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/terms-and-conditions) and other agreements; (iv) protecting the assets or property, and enforcing the rights of Misfits Market, including for billing and collection purposes; and (v) protecting the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.

4\. Cookies and Similar Technologies 

We may use cookies, beacons, and similar technologies, now or in the future, to support the functionality of our Website. This provides a better experience when you visit our Website and allows us to improve our Website. Our service providers may use cookies and beacons to collect and disclose certain Personal Information about your activities both on our Website and on other websites. In addition, third parties that are unaffiliated with us may also collect information about you, including tracking your browsing history, when you use our Website. If you wish to minimize these third-party collections, you can adjust the settings of your browsers, install plug-ins and add-ins, or use the opt out mechanisms noted below.  Examples of the types of technologies we use on the Website include:

* Browser Cookies. A browser cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. That cookie then communicates with servers (both ours and those of other companies that we authorize to collect data for us) and allows recognition of your personal computer or other device. You may use the tools available on the device you use to access the Website to set your browser to refuse or disable all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being set. However, if you refuse or disable all browser cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts or use certain features or functionality of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it refuses all cookies, we may use cookies when you direct your browser to our Website. 
* Beacons. Our Website and emails may contain small electronic files known as beacons (also referred to as web beacons, clear GIFs, pixel tags and single-pixel GIFs) that permit us to, for example, count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other website-related statistics. Beacons in email marketing campaigns also allow us to track your responses and your interests in our content, offerings, and web pages. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns and help us tailor the content we deliver to you. You may use the tools in your device to disable these technologies as well.

Google, Inc. (“Google”) is one example of a partner of ours that uses cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your visit to our Website. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google that uses first-party cookies to track users' interactions and collect other information about how you use our Website. We then use the information to compile reports, including usage trends, to help us improve our Website. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our Website. For more information on how Google collects and uses this data, go to [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), or review the Google Analytics Terms of Service at [https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/).

5\. Your Rights and Choices

We offer you certain choices in connection with the Personal Information we collect from you.

* Email Communications. When you provide us with your email address, you will receive certain email communications from us related to our Website and Services. You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of our emails, but note that it may take some time, in accordance with our legal obligations, to fulfill your request. Please also note that certain emails may be necessary for the operation of our Website and Services. You will continue to receive these emails, if appropriate, even if you unsubscribe from our optional communications.
* Text Communications. When you provide us with your phone number while signing up for our Services, you will receive certain transactional and informational text messages from us related to your account and orders. You may also have the option to receive certain automated marketing and promotional messages. If you provide us with your phone number in order to receive text message communications, you may opt out of receiving text messages at any time by replying “STOP”, and you can contact us [here](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact) if you need additional help. If you unsubscribe from one of our text message programs, you acknowledge that you may continue to receive text messages from Misfits Market through our other text message programs you may have joined until you separately unsubscribe from those programs. We do not disclose your opt-in data and consent preferences with any third parties other than our text message provider. For additional information about our text messaging program, please review our [Terms of Service](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/terms-and-conditions). 
* Cookies and Similar Technologies. If you wish to minimize information collected by cookie or beacon, you can adjust the settings of your browsers to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it. You can also set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. You may also be able to install plug-ins and add-ins that serve similar functions. However, please be aware that some features and services on our Website may not work properly after you adjust certain cookies. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. Please note that most cookie-based opt-outs will only affect the specific computer and browser that is used to submit an opt-out request. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device.
* Network Advertising Initiative. Certain websites you visit may provide options regarding tailored advertisements you receive when on those websites. If you wish to minimize the amount of targeted advertising you receive, you can opt out of certain network advertising programs through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out) you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you. For more information or to opt out of certain online behavioral advertising, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info](https://youradchoices.com/). Additionally, many advertising network programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories that they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.

If you are resident of certain states in the U.S., you may also have the following rights regarding your Personal Information (each of which are subject to various exceptions and limitations):

General Rights

* Right to Request Access to Personal Information. You may have the right to request access to the specific pieces of Personal Information we hold about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Additional information about the categories of Personal Information we have collected from or about you, the categories of sources from which we have collected that information, the business or commercial purpose for the collection, selling, or sharing of such information, and the categories of third parties to which we have disclosed this information are all described in this Privacy Policy. 
* Right to Delete Personal Information. You may have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions permitted under applicable law. For example, if your information is necessary to complete your order, protect against fraud, or complete other lawful purposes recognized under the law, we may deny your request or retain certain Personal Information as required or permitted by law. 
* Right to Correct Personal Information. The accuracy of the information we have about you is very important. To review or correct your Personal Information, please visit the “Account Details” section of the Website and following the prompts, or contact us [here.](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact) 
* Right to Nondiscrimination. Misfits Market will not discriminate against you in any way if you choose to exercise any of the above rights. However, please keep in mind that some of our Services cannot be provided if we do not have your Personal Information.

You (or an Authorized Agent acting on your behalf as detailed below) may exercise these rights by clicking [here](https://privacy-misfits-market.us.fides.ethyca.com/). If you have additional questions or need help exercising your rights, you can contact us by clicking [here](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact).  

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states and we deny your request to exercise the rights described above in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal our decision. If you are a resident of one of these states and you wish to make such a request, please contact us by clicking [here](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact).

Right to Opt-out of Targeted Advertising and Sale/Sharing of Personal Information

As we described in the Online Advertising Partners section above, we disclose your Personal Information with certain third-party partners that provide us with online advertising and related analytics services, as well as certain direct marketing services.  In certain states, these activities may be considered the “sale” of Personal Information or the “sharing” or “processing” of Personal Information for purposes of online targeted advertising. If you would like to exercise your right to opt-out of online targeted advertising, as well as the sale of your Personal Information, please submit a request [here](https://privacy-misfits-market.us.fides.ethyca.com/). If you have additional questions or need help exercising your rights, you can contact us by clicking [here](https://www.imperfectfoods.com/contact).

Some browsers offer you the ability to opt out of cookie-based and other online tracking, which may be considered the “sale” of Personal Information or the “sharing” or “processing” of Personal Information for online targeted advertising. At this time, we endeavor to respond to browser-based opt-out signals sent through the Global Privacy Control: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/. We do not respond to “do not track” or other browser-based signals.

Please note that in order to exercise the rights described in this section, you will need to verify your identity to protect your security and Personal Information. Only you or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf (an “Authorized Agent”) may submit a request. If an Authorized Agent submits a request on your behalf, we may require written proof of authorization and verification of identity directly from you.

6\. Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as we reasonably consider it necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or for as long as we are required or permitted to retain it under applicable law (including to satisfy our legal, accounting, or reporting obligations). To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information, and applicable legal requirements.

7\. Securing Your Personal Information

The security of your information is important to us, and we have established administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized alteration, access, loss, theft, use, or disclosure. Unfortunately, no system can guarantee complete security of your information. As a result, Misfits Market cannot ensure or warrant that your information, including your Personal Information, is secure from unauthorized third parties. Thus, your use of the Website and communication with us about them is at your own risk.

You are responsible for protecting your password and for the security of information that you transmit to us over the Internet. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with the Website is no longer secure (for example, if you believe that the security of your username or password has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us.

8\. Children’s Information

Our Website is directed to and is intended to be used only by persons who are 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect information from individuals under 18 and do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Information of anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18 years of age, you are not permitted to register for an account or otherwise submit any Personal Information to us, including your name, address, or email address. If we discover that we have collected any Personal Information from an individual under the age of 18, we will suspend the associated account and remove that information from our database as soon as possible. By registering for an account or submitting any Personal Information to us, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older.

9\. Third-Party Websites and Services

Our Website may contain links to third-party websites and services. Please note that these links are provided for your convenience and information, and the websites and services are owned and controlled by third parties, operate independently from us, and have their own privacy policies or notices, which we strongly suggest you review. This Privacy Policy applies to Misfits Market and our Website only. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the policies or practices of any third parties, and we do not endorse, screen, or approve of, the terms or policies of websites or services that we do not own or control. The inclusion of a link on the Website does not imply Misfits Market’s endorsement of the linked site or service. If you choose to access any websites or services linked from our Website, please check the applicable policies before you use or submit any personal data to such website or service. 

10\. Additional Privacy Information for California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purposes for which we use each category of Personal Information we collect and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such Personal Information for a business purpose, (b) “share” such Personal Information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such Personal Information.

While we do not “sell” your Personal Information in exchange for money, the definitions of “sell” and “share” under California law are very broad and include many common business activities involving the transfer of data, such as certain types of online advertising and related analytics activities as further described in the Online Advertising Partners section above. Therefore, some of these activities may constitute “sharing” or “selling” Personal Information under California law.  The following chart details these practices. 

![](https://images.prismic.io/melodious-taiyaki-9pkr2z/ZtuHDhoQrfVKlzu1_Screenshot2024-09-06at3.49.03PM.png?auto=format,compress)

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and third parties to which we disclose or sell/share Personal Information, please see the sections entitled What Personal Information We Collect, How We Use Your Personal Information, and How We Disclose Your Personal Information above. 

Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” And “Selling”

As described in more detail in the Your Rights and Choices section of our Privacy Policy, you have the right to opt out of Misfits Market’s sale/sharing of your Personal Information for purposes of online advertising, analytics, and related activities by clicking [here](https://privacy-misfits-market.us.fides.ethyca.com/).

Other CCPA Rights

Please see the Your Rights and Choices section of our Privacy Policy for information about the additional rights you have with respect to your Personal Information under California law and how to exercise them. 

Please see the Data Retention section of our Privacy Policy for more information about Misfits Market’s retention of your Personal Information.

The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for business purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA.
