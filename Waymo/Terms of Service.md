9\. Indemnification
-------------------

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Waymo and its affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “Waymo Parties”) from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, expenses or costs ("Claims") arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of our Services; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); and (e) your conduct in connection with our Services.

This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Waymo or the other Waymo Parties.

10\. Disclaimers
----------------

Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us, our Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, Waymo does not represent or warrant that our Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. While Waymo attempts to make your use of our Services safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Services or servers are free of viruses or other harmful components.

11\. Limitation of Liability
----------------------------

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Waymo and the other Waymo Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even if Waymo or the other Waymo Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.The total liability of Waymo and the other Waymo Parties, for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to use our Services.The limitations set forth in this section will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud, or intentional misconduct of Waymo or the other Waymo Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

12\. Release
------------

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Waymo and the other Waymo Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which says “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”

13\. Transfer and Processing Data
---------------------------------

By using our Services, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information about you in and to the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.

14\. Governing Law and Venue
----------------------------

Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of our Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in Santa Clara County, CA.

15\. Modifying and Terminating our Services
-------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of our Services at any time. You also have the right to stop using our Services at any time. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.

16\. Severability
-----------------

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

17\. Miscellaneous
------------------

The failure of Waymo to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
