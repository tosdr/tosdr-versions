[](#the-gist-2)The gist
-----------------------

We (the folks at Watch2gether) run a social video platform called Watch2Gether and would love you to use it. Watch2Gether’s basic service is free, and we offer paid upgrades for advanced features in the Watch2Gether +PLUS membership program. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on in your Watch2Gether chat rooms. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appear in your room.

If you find a Watch2Gether room that you believe violates these Terms of Use, please [contact us](https://community.watch2gether.com/t/impressum-imprint/594).

[](#your-watch2gether-account-4)Your Watch2Gether Account
---------------------------------------------------------

When you create a room on Watch2Gether, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your room and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur in the room and any other actions taken in connection with the room. You must immediately notify Watch2Gether of any unauthorized uses of your room, your Watch2Gether account, or any other breaches of security. Watch2Gether will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

[](#responsibility-of-contributors-5)Responsibility of Contributors
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you operate a room, participate in a room, post content into a room, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Watch2Gether, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms.

In particular, it is not allowed to share the following content in a Watch2Gether room:

* Content that shows or advertises illegal activities
* Content that violates the copyright of others
* Content that is not appropriate for the youngest member of a room

If you delete Content or a room, Watch2Gether will use reasonable efforts to remove it from Watch2Gether, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Watch2Gether has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Watch2Gether’s sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or room due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in Watch2Gether’s reasonable opinion, violates any Watch2Gether policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of Watch2Gether to any individual or entity for any reason. Watch2Gether will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

Our order process is conducted by our online reseller [Paddle.com](http://paddle.com/). [Paddle.com](http://paddle.com/) is the Merchant of Record for all our orders. Paddle provides all customer service inquiries and handles returns.

Optional paid services such as the Watch2Gether +PLUS membership are available (any such services, an “Upgrade”). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Watch2Gether the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Unless otherwise stated, payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.

### [](#automatic-renewal-9)Automatic Renewal

Unless you notify Watch2Gether before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Upgrades section of your user profile. Subscription fees are not refundable.

As Watch2Gether asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. Watch2Gether itself does not provide any content on its servers and does not offer its users any possibility to upload content. All content displayed in the player is integrated from other websites or services (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion …) via embed interfaces. If you believe that material located or linked on Watch2Gether violates your copyright, you are encouraged [to notify](https://community.watch2gether.com/t/impressum-imprint/594) Watch2Gether. Watch2Gether will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. Watch2Gether will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Watch2Gether or others. In the case of such termination, Watch2Gether will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Watch2Gether.

Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Watch2Gether or third-party trademarks.

[](#changes-14)Changes
----------------------

We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
