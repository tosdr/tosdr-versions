Please note you will continue to receive transactional messages related to our Services, even if you unsubscribe from marketing emails.

Newsletters
-----------

You acknowledge that all newsletter(s) released and distributed by Power Thesaurus are a privilege and not a right. We reserve the right to remove, refuse, or ban a user from our newsletter(s) at any time without prior notice.

Your acknowledgement and full acceptance of Power Thesaurus's terms and conditions is given by subscribing and maintaining a subscription to any or all of our newsletters.

You acknowledge that, as with Power Thesaurus, the views, opinions, and documents, such as newsletter articles or the entire newsletter itself, given do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Power Thesaurus. Many items on this site are written by other parties.

You acknowledge that, as with Power Thesaurus, you will hold harmless this site from any losses (including attorney fees), damages, claims, liabilities, or problems that may occur during your involvement with this site, submissions made to this site, dealings with others on this site, or any other actions performed on this site that may result in loss.

You acknowledge that, despite a newsletter being a different form of electronic content than a website, mobile application or browser extension, all other terms and conditions stated within this page or other policies of Power Thesaurus apply to newsletters or other forms of content.

Indemnity
---------

You shall indemnify, release and hold harmless Power Thesaurus and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors and suppliers, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any loss, liability (including settlements, judgments, fines and penalties) and costs (including reasonable attorney fees, court costs and other litigation expenses) relating to any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of your access to the Site, use of the Services or Software, violation of this Agreement, or infringement of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

Warranty disclaimers
--------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Power Thesaurus, its licensors and its suppliers expressly disclaim any and all warranties and conditions, express or implied, regarding the site, services, and software, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, noninfringement, satisfactory quality or arising from a course of dealing, law, usage, or trade practice, or regarding security, quiet enjoyment, reliability, timeliness and performance. You agree that your use of Power Thesaurus is at your own sole risk and that Power Thesaurus is provided on an “as is,” “where is,” “as available,” “with all faults” basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Power Thesaurus and its licensors and its suppliers do not warrant that the operation of Power Thesaurus will meet your requirements or will be uninterrupted or error-free.

Limitation of liability
-----------------------

In no event shall Power Thesaurus be liable with respect to the site, services and/or software for (i) any amount in the aggregate in excess of the fees you have actually paid to Power Thesaurus during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event(s) giving rise to such liability; (ii) any lost profits, lost or damaged user content or other data, or failure to meet any duty, including without limitation good faith and reasonable care; or (iii) any indirect, incidental, punitive, special, exemplary or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever.

You agree that this limitation of liability represents a reasonable allocation of risk and is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between Power Thesaurus and You. You understand that the site, services and software would not be provided without such limitations.

Certain states do not allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of this limitation of liability may not apply to you and you may have additional rights.

If you are a user from New Jersey, the foregoing sections titled “warranty disclaimers” and “limitation of liability” are intended to be only as broad as is permitted under the laws of the state of new jersey. If any portion of these sections is held to be invalid under the laws of the state of new jersey, the invalidity of such portion shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the applicable sections.
