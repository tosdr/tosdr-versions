How We Collect Personal Information
===================================

We collect and compile personal information from multiple sources, both online and offline, directly and from third-party sources using different devices, sources, and technologies.

You Provide it to Us
--------------------

When you interact with or visit one of our Sites you may provide us personal information while engaging in activities such as:

* Creating an account on, interact with, and/or provide search terms or preferences on one of our websites, mobile services, or interactive screens or directories at our retail shopping destinations (e.g., the Simon mobile app, Simon Search®, the Simon Mall Insider®, the Premium Outlets VIP Shopper Club®, or the Simon Mobile Shopper Club)
* Purchasing Simon® Giftcards;
* Signing-up and/or participating in our programs or promotions, such as the Simon® American Express® Credit Card program;
* Contacting us for customer support or any other purpose, including by the use of voicemail or call recording technology (in compliance with applicable law);
* Posting content to one of our websites, mobile services, or social media pages such as solicited or unsolicited content you generate, ratings, reviews, feedback, or contest or survey entries;
* Participating in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey;
* Signing-up to connect to the “# Free Simon Wi-Fi" network, which we provide for your use; and
* Interacting with or using services on our websites, mobile applications, or interactive screens or directories in our retail shopping destinations that rely on audio, video, or photographic images you supply though our device’s or your device’s camera(s) or microphone(s) or recordings you otherwise make and submit to us to provide you a service (e.g., promotional social media filters, virtual photo frames, product scanning, or voice search).

We Collect it Automatically
---------------------------

When you visit our Sites or interact with our advertising or other communications with you (such as clicking a link in an advertisement or e-mail), we automatically gather personal information about you such as device and account identifiers and internet or network usage information. 

Unless prohibited by applicable law, we gather precise geolocation information from your device using technologies deployed in our retail shopping destinations such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth beacons if your device’s location sharing settings (which you can change) allow it. Bluetooth beacons allow us to show you products that may interest you based on your preferences or other data we have collected about you.

If your device has GPS enabled and you have allowed your GPS location to be shared with us or you otherwise indicate your position or preferred retail shopping destination on an interactive map or drop-down on one of our Sites including services such as Simon Search, we can show you the Simon retail shopping destination(s) closest to you and can provide you a path to navigating through such retail shopping destination(s) to store(s) that contains item(s) of interest to you (based on search terms and results or preferences you provide to us). 

We Get it from Businesses Affiliated with Us
--------------------------------------------

Companies that share common ownership or management control or that are our partners in certain ventures (“**Affiliates**”) may share information with us about you.

We Get it from Unaffiliated Third-party Sources and Public Material
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We get additional personal information about you from third-party or publicly available sources (such as third-party device and browsing data, bot detection results, social media posts, and background and public record search results), with the aim of enhancing the accuracy and completeness of our records, verifying your identity, qualifying you for services, refining the quality and customization of our services, enhancing the attractiveness and relevance of our advertisements, to fight spam and abuse, and bolstering our fraud prevention efforts.

Who We Disclose Personal Information to and Why
===============================================

We disclose the types of personal information described in the [_Personal Information We Collect_](#personal-information-we-collect) section above with the types of third parties described below.

Businesses Affiliated with Us
