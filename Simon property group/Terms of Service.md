    -----------------------
    
    Simon will have the right (but not the obligation), in our sole discretion, to monitor, evaluate, and analyze Content, and any use of and access to the Sites, including to determine compliance with these Terms of Use and any other operating rules that may be established by Simon from time to time.

    The Simon Entities and Vendors may make available various Materials. The Materials are for educational and informational purposes only, and errors may appear from time to time. Before you act in reliance on any Materials, you should confirm any facts that are important to your decision. The Simon Entities and their Vendors make no warranty as to the reliability, accuracy, timeliness, usefulness, or completeness of any Materials. If you find an error or have a question or feedback regarding any of our Materials on the Sites, [contact us now](https://www.simon.com/contact). We appreciate your feedback!
    
    THE SIMON ENTITIES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENCE RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO ANY ACTION OR INACTION YOU TAKE BASED ON THE MATERIALS.
    
6. Vendor Products
    ---------------
    
    The Sites may make available listings, descriptions, and images of goods and services for sale by Vendors (collectively, “**Products**”) including as part of our Simon Search service. Product listings or information and order taking may be made available by us or by a Vendor. However, Product delivery is provided by the relevant Vendor and not Simon (NOTE: Simon Giftcards are not included in the term “Products” and are sold pursuant to separate terms and conditions). We make no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity, or timeliness of such Product listings, descriptions, or images (including any features, specifications, and prices contained on the Sites). Such information and the availability of any Product are subject to change at any time without notice by us or the relevant Vendor.
    
    We and our Vendors have made efforts to accurately display the attributes of Products, including the applicable colors. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we and our Vendors cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will accurately reflect actual product color or finish. In addition, certain weights, measures, and similar descriptions are approximate and are for convenience only.
    
    Simon has no liability to you for Products on the Sites that you find to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. If any Products are labeled with age restrictions or are intended for individuals of certain ages or “mature audiences” only, by ordering any such age restricted Product, you certify that you satisfy such age restrictions.
    
    Simon is not responsible for, and cannot provide any guarantee or warranty regarding the performance or manufacturing or design quality of, Products provided by Vendors, including any of Simon’s Affiliates, or other goods and services of other third parties to whose sites we link. While our goal is to provide accurate information, Product packaging and material may contain more or different (or both) information than that provided on the Sites, including the product description, country of origin, nutrition, ingredient, allergen, and other information. Always read labels, warnings, directions, and other information provided with the Products before using or consuming any Products. For additional information about a Product, please contact the manufacturer or Vendor of such Product. If you find a Product is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it (if eligible) in accordance with the applicable Vendor’s or manufacturer’s return policy. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all Applicable Laws and any applicable international laws (including minimum age requirements) regarding the purchase, possession, and use of any Products.
    
7. Third-party Sites and Materials
    -------------------------------
    
    References on the Sites to (i) any names, marks, Products, Materials, goods, services, or other content of Vendors or any other third party (“**Third-party Materials**”), or (ii) the sites, applications, social media accounts, other publications containing Third-party Materials, or App Platforms of any Vendor or third-party with which the Sites operate, link to, or otherwise interact (“**Third-party Sites**”), are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of such Third-party Materials or Third-party Sites. When you visit any Third-party Site, whether referenced on, linked to, or with which you interact on or related to one of our Sites, you are no longer accessing the Sites and the third-party that is providing such Third-party Site is responsible for the Third-party Materials on such Third-party Site. Simon is not responsible for the Third-party Materials on any Third-party Site or any link contained in any such Third-party Site nor is Simon responsible for the acts or omissions of any operator or owner of any such Third-party Site. Your use of any such Third-party Site is at your own risk and will be governed by such Vendor’s or other third party's terms and conditions (including its privacy policy) with which you should familiarize yourself prior to using such Third-party Site. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the disclaimer of warranties, limitations of liability, indemnifications, and dispute resolution provisions contained in Sections 14, 15, 16, and 17 shall apply regarding any claim against any of the Simon Entities or Vendors in any way relating to our Sites including claims relating to any references made on the Sites to any Third-party Materials or Third-party Sites.
    
8. Accounts and E-commerce
    -----------------------
    
    1. ### Account Creation and Termination
        
        In order to use certain features of the Sites, including the [Simon Mall Insider](https://www.simon.com/mall-insider)® or [VIP Shopper Club](https://www.premiumoutlets.com/vip), you may be required to register for an account (“**Account**”) by providing certain information about yourself as prompted by our registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all information you provide is truthful and accurate; and (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information in your Account at all times. Your registration information must not misrepresent your identity or your affiliation with any person or organization. You may request changes to your registration information and/or terminate your Account at any time, for any reason, by submitting a request to our [online privacy & data portal](https://click.simon.com/privacy-portal) making sure to select the "General User Request" type and providing the necessary information within the "Request Details" field. Without limiting anything set out elsewhere in this Agreement, we may, at our discretion, suspend or terminate your Account at any time for any reason without affecting our rights under this Terms of Use.
        
    2. ### Account Responsibilities
        
        You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information including your username and password and for all activities that occur under your Account, including the use of your Account by members of your household or anyone else. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use of your Account, or any other breach of security of your Account, by submitting a new investigation request to our [online privacy & data portal](https://click.simon.com/privacy-portal) making sure to select the "General User Request" type and providing the necessary information within the "Request Details" field. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to restrict access to your Account or if you lose or share access to your device.
        
    3. ### Order Acceptance and Billing
        
        You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other means of payment that you associate with an Account or otherwise provide to us if we have enabled the purchase of any Products through our Sites. By providing payment card information to us, you authorize us to store and use the card as a payment method for purchases made through your Account or otherwise through our Sites. Any agreement between you and the issuer of your credit card, debit card, or other form of payment you provide to us will continue to govern your use of such payment method on the Sites. You agree that Simon is not a party to any such agreement, nor is Simon responsible for the content, accuracy, or unavailability of any method used for payment. Simon may participate in account update services offered by some banks that will automatically update your card number or expiration date in our system when it changes. If you do not want to have your cards automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your issuing bank. All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate. Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information is a breach of these Terms of Use and may result in cancellation of your order. Prior to accepting an order we may also request additional information from you. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any purchase. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will attempt to contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. Simon may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
        
        By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the Products, as well as all shipping and handling charges (if applicable) and applicable taxes.
        
        If we have enabled the purchase of any Products through our Sites, Simon reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household, or per order for any reason. We will attempt to notify you should such limits be applied. Simon also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. For purposes of these Terms of Use, “reselling” will be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any Product(s) from Simon for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of the same Product(s) to a third party.
        
        In addition to any other remedies available to Simon, Simon may in its sole discretion restrict or terminate your Account, or cancel or refuse orders for violations of, or abuse of this Terms of Use or a Vendor’s returns policy.
        
    4. ### Pricing Information; Availability; Delivery
        
        If we have enabled the purchase of any Products through our Sites, Simon cannot confirm the price or availability of any Products until after your order is placed. Pricing or availability errors may occur on the Sites or through Vendors. The receipt of an order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product. Simon reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing or availability errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Simon. Simon may, in Simon’s discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

Shipping or pick-up instructions, tracking, or tax, shipping, or handling charges (if applicable) for any order through the Sites as provided by any Vendor are also subject to error and modification similar to Product pricing and availability as described above and any such error or modification may be due to your failure to supply accurate information or valid payment, which may result in cancellation of your order. Generally, any Vendor will not be responsible for any Product in an order once such Product has been placed with a shipping carrier (if applicable) or once you or a person with apparent authority from you picks-up such Product as instructed by the Vendor (which instruction may be provided through the Sites). Simon is not responsible for the shipping or delivery of any Product at any time whether ordered through the Site or any Third-party Site.

17. Dispute Resolution (Arbitration)
    --------------------------------
    
    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
    
    1. ### Arbitration Agreement.
        
        EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR AND ARE FILED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE SIMON ENTITIES, INCLUDING ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED OR SOLD BY SIMON, VENDORS, OR THE SIMON ENTITIES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND SIMON AGREE THAT EACH IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BY A JURY. This paragraph may be referred to as the Arbitration Agreement in these Terms of Use.
        
    2. ### Class Action and Mass Action Waiver.
        
        YOU AND SIMON AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION REQUIRED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. You and Simon each agree to waive the right to have any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a class arbitration, class action, collective action, or Mass Action to the maximum extent permitted by Governing Law. “**Mass Action**” means a situation in which a Party is represented by a law firm or other representative, or a collection of law firms or other representatives, that has initiated more than one hundred (100) arbitration Demands (as defined in the next paragraph) with common questions of law or fact against any of the Simon Entities within 180 days of initiating your arbitration Demand. This paragraph may be referred to as the “Class Action and Mass Action Waiver” in these Terms of Use. Nothing in these Terms of Use precludes you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local government agencies and, if Applicable Law allows, such agencies may seek relief against Simon for you.
        
    3. ### Initiating a Demand for Arbitration.
        
        Any arbitration required by the Arbitration Agreement shall be initiated by You or Simon by sending the other a written demand for arbitration (“**Demand**”) only via first-class mail, FedEx, or UPS within the statute of limitations period provided by Governing Law. Your Demand shall be delivered to **Simon Media Properties, LLC, Attention: General Counsel, 225 W. Washington Street, Indianapolis, IN 46204** and you shall send a facsimile copy of such Demand by e-mail at **sfivel@simon.com**. The Demand must include (i) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address of the person or entity seeking arbitration; (ii) a statement of the legal claims asserted and the factual basis for those claims; (iii) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy; (iv) the original personal signature of the Party seeking arbitration; and (v) the original personal signature of any legal counsel or other representative purporting to represent the Party seeking arbitration. For purposes of this paragraph, “original personal signature” does not include any digital, scanned, electronic, copied, or facsimile signature. An original personal signature on the Demand certifies the following: (i) the Demand is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing Applicable Law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing Applicable Law or for establishing new Applicable Law; and (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The original personal signature by the Party seeking arbitration shall verify under penalty of perjury that the factual statements contained in the Demand are true and correct. Compliance with this paragraph tolls any applicable statute of limitations as to any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement that is stated in the Demand.
        
    4. ### Filing a Demand for Arbitration.
        
        A Party seeking arbitration of any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement shall submit a copy of the Demand to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) sixty (60) or more days after the Demand is initiated pursuant to Section 17(c) of these Terms of Use. The arbitration will be administered by the AAA pursuant to the current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, except to the extent modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA rules and instructions are available on the AAA website at [www.adr.org/consumer](http://www.adr.org/consumer).
        
    5. ### Conduct of Arbitration.
        
        In any arbitration of a dispute or claim that is subject to the Arbitration Agreement:
        
        1. You or Simon may file such dispositive motions as would be permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure without obtaining permission from the arbitrator. Upon the filing of any dispositive motion, the arbitrator may stay all further action and deadlines in the arbitration until deciding such motion.
        2. The Parties shall have the right to conduct such discovery from the opposing Party or any third party that is proportional to the needs of the claim or dispute, considering the importance of the issues at stake, the amount in controversy, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Proportionality shall be decided by the arbitrator when requested by either Party.
        3. The arbitrator shall conduct any calls, conferences, or hearings by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is appropriate and necessary. Any in-person hearing will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to both Parties. You and an employee of Simon shall attend all arbitrator calls, conferences, and hearings.
        4. A Party may make a written offer of judgment at least seven (7) days before the date set for the arbitration hearing.
        5. If the arbitrator finds that a Party’s claim, counterclaim, or appeal was frivolous, asserted in bad faith, or pursued for purposes of harassment, the arbitrator shall award the opposing Party its attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses and all amounts charged by AAA for the arbitration.
        6. The arbitrator will follow these Terms of Use and Governing Law. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to commit errors of Applicable Law or legal reasoning. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual Party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual Party’s claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a Party, though the individual relief awarded by the arbitrator may incidentally affect non-Parties.
        7. You or Simon may appeal an arbitration award that manifestly disregards the law by filing a notice of appeal with the AAA within 30 days after an award is rendered and delivered to the Parties. The appeal shall be heard by a single arbitrator unless the Parties agree to a multi-arbitrator appellate panel. The arbitrator(s) assigned to the appeal shall be selected by agreement of the Parties from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. If the Parties are unable to agree, AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s) from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. An arbitrator who previously presided over any aspect of a case shall be ineligible from serving as an appellate arbitrator in that same case. The appeal, including briefing, shall be conducted pursuant to the Parties’ agreement or the appellate arbitrator(s)’ orders if the Parties are unable to agree.
    6. ### Process for Arbitration Bellwether Demands.
        
        If twenty-five (25) or more Demands for arbitration of a dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement are initiated (i) that involve common questions of law or fact and (ii) where the initiating parties are represented by the same law firm, the same group of coordinated law firms, or the same representative, then such Demands shall be coordinated pursuant to this paragraph. The group of claimants and group of respondents shall each select five (5) Demands, for a total of ten (10), to be filed with AAA (collectively the “**Bellwether Demands**”). Each of the Bellwether Demands shall be assigned by AAA to a different arbitrator chosen from its national roster. After ninety (90) days from the date all Bellwether Demands have been arbitrated and any appeals exhausted, any remaining Demands subject to this paragraph may be filed with AAA. The AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings shall apply to the extent they are not inconsistent with this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Terms of Use, you and Simon agree that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce the terms of this paragraph with injunctive or other relief.
        
    7. ### Severability.
        
        If (i) any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement is filed as a class arbitration, class action, collective action, representative action, or Mass Action and (ii) if the Class Action and Mass Action Waiver is held invalid or unenforceable as to such dispute or claim, then the Arbitration Agreement does not apply to that dispute or claim and such dispute or claim must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of Section 17 other than the Class Action and Mass Action Waiver is held invalid or unenforceable as to a particular dispute or claim, then such provision shall be severed from the Terms of Use, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Governing Law.
        
    8. ### Applicable Law.
        
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Terms of Use, the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of Section 17 of these Terms of Use (only) by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction deciding any matter pursuant to this Section 17. If the FAA is found not to apply to any portion of Section 17 of these Terms of Use by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, then the Governing Law shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of such portion of this Section 17.
        
    
18. Termination

    These Terms of Use are effective unless and until terminated by either you or Simon. You may terminate these Terms of Use at any time by discontinuing any further use of the Sites.

19. General
    -------
    
    These Terms of Use represent the complete agreement and understanding between you and Simon and supersede all prior agreements and representations between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and Simon. Headings used in these Terms of Use are for reference purposes only and in no way define or limit the scope of the relevant section. Except as provided in Section 17 above, if any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the other terms of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect. Except as provided in Section 17 above, these Terms of Use shall be interpreted and governed by the Governing Law.
