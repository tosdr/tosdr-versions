Self-Serve Subscription Agreement



Last Updated: March 6, 2024

This Self-Serve Subscription Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the use of Netlify’s software, solutions

and services (“Netlify Services”) to build, deploy, host, and manage web projects.

By clicking on the “Create Account” button (or any similar button) that is presented to you at the time

of sign-up or by using or accessing the Netlify Services (“Order”), you indicate that you agree to the

terms and conditions of this Agreement, and that will also be the effective date of this Agreement

(“Effective Date”).

You will be referred to in this Agreement as either “you” or “Customer.” If you are entering into this

Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity, you are agreeing to this

Agreement for that entity and representing that you have the authority to bind such entity to this

Agreement, in which case the terms “Customer” or “you” will refer to such entity. If you do not have

such authority, or if you do not agree with this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and

must not use the Netlify Services.

In appropriate cases, Netlify will enter into a written Enterprise Subscription Agreement with the

Customer which will govern instead of this Agreement.

A valid Netlify account may only be created and maintained by a Customer who provides valid

information about the Customer in the signup process. To maintain a valid account, the Customer

must regularly update such information to assure its accuracy. Netlify reserves the right to terminate

any account that does not include a valid email address on file.

Please be aware, however, that if the domain of the email address associated with your account is

owned or controlled by an entity and Netlify has now or in the future a direct subscription agreement

with such entity, your account may be rolled into and consolidated with that organization’s account

after notification to you. Following notice to you, if you choose not to change the email address

associated with your account, your account will be controlled by the entity.
