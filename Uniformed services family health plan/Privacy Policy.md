Privacy Policy 

Privacy, Security, Legal
========================

**Disclaimers**
---------------

The health-related information and resources on this website are made available to you solely for informational purposes. It does not constitute medical advice and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical care. Nothing on this site is intended to be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of your health care provider before beginning any new treatment or if you have any questions regarding a medical condition. If you are ill or need immediate medical care, please contact your health care provider or, in an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest medical facility.

US Family Health Plan will attempt to keep the information available through this website current and accurate, but makes no guarantees and disclaims any implied warranty or representation about the website’s accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose. Information on this website may be updated at any time and without notice.

When you access usfamilyhealth.org, conduct any transaction, use any functionality or tool, or access information on or through the website, you are agreeing to accept the legal disclaimers and adhere to the privacy and security policies set forth on the website.

**Limitation of Liability**
---------------------------

In no event shall US Family Health Plan be liable for any direct, indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages, or any damages whatsoever resulting from any loss of use, loss of profits, litigation, or any other pecuniary loss, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), product liability, or otherwise, arising out of or in any way connected with this website or the provision of or failure to make available any such products, goods, or services, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

**Privacy and Security on the Public Site**
-------------------------------------------

US Family Health Plan understands that privacy of information is of great importance to our members and the people who visit our website. We want you to know that US Family Health Plan does not sell information obtained through use of this website to anyone. In addition, we have established the following privacy and security practices with respect to the public portions of usfamilyhealth.org.

Because we want  the website to better serve visitors’ needs, we collect some basic information about visitors’ computers, including:

* IP address (the computer’s unique signature)
* Operating system (e.g., Windows Vista)
* Browser software (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox)
* Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL)
* Geographic location (e.g., Boston, Mass.)

The information we collect about visitors’ computers will not be used to identify individuals. Instead, we check which Web pages and services people use while they are here. For example, we use the browser information to help us design our website so that as many people as possible will be able to view the pages correctly. The information helps us determine what parts of the site people like and what parts they don’t, so that we can adjust information appropriately.

**Privacy and Security on the Secured Sites**
---------------------------------------------

The secure member portal that is password protected and requires individuals to register and log-in contains protected health information (PHI) and allows individuals to perform certain transactions (e.g., order an ID card). Because of this, a user’s activity needs to be linked back to the user’s identity. For example, when a member changes his or her PCP, we must be able to make that change within our systems and we cannot do that without linking the information back to the member. In addition, it is important for us to keep track of what functionality a member uses. Therefore, in the secure member portal, certain identifiable information is collected about users. This includes information about the user’s computer as listed above, and information related to the user, such as pages visited and PHI submitted or changed.

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your PHI are important to US Family Health Plan. To protect against unauthorized access to PHI that is accessible on the password-protected portions of our site, stringent security standards are followed. Data transmitted between your browser and the secure member portal is protected by 128-bit encryption.  
PHI that is collected from users on the secure member portal is confidential. All PHI US Family Health Plan has regarding our members is available only to authorized users and is protected from unauthorized access by multiple layers of security controls and monitoring. In addition, PHI that is collected and maintained by US Family Health Plan is used and disclosed only in accordance with our Notice of Privacy Practices in the [Member Handbook](https://www.usfamilyhealth.org/for-members/member-handbook/).

E-mail addresses are collected as part of the registration process for the secure member portal. These e-mail addresses are used to notify registrants of online activity related to the security and privacy of their accounts, such as retrievals of username. In addition, e-mail addresses may be used to send members health and wellness information and other updates that might be of interest to them as members of US Family Health Plan. Each time we send health and wellness information and other updates, the recipient will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving similar e-mails in the future. Please note that registrants cannot opt out of receiving e-mails that notify them of online activity, since these are necessary to protect the privacy and security of Web accounts.

**Cookies**
-----------

We use “cookies” on the public site and the secure member portal to help users better navigate the sites. They are used only for that distinct purpose. A “cookie” is a small piece of information sent by our Web server to store on your Web browser. We use this information to tell if you have been given important messages about the functioning of this site.

**E-mail**
----------

We welcome your comments or questions about our website and have provided an e-mail option for that purpose. We will share your comments and questions with our member services representatives and those employees most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. Remember, your e-mail may not be encrypted and may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge while in transit to us. For that reason, please do not send confidential health care or personal information to us by e-mail. US Family Health Plan disclaims any responsibility for any breach of confidentiality resulting from your transmittal of such e-mail. If you need to contact US Family Health Plan regarding confidential matters, please call Member Services at 1.800.818.8589.

------------------------

For your interest and convenience, we have provided some links from usfamilyhealth.org to other websites. The links are provided for your convenience only and do not constitute or imply that US Family Health Plan endorses these sites, any material or information contained in the sites, or of any products or services described on these sites.
