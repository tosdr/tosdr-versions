Privacy Policy

**Overview**

This Privacy Policy describes how Pinger treats information that it collects and receives related to your use of Pinger’s products, services, and websites. Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide and improve our products and services.

**Children’s Personal Information**

All Pinger products, services and websites are not intended for children under the age of 13, so children under the age of 13 should not use them at any time.

Pinger does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. In the event that Pinger discovers that it has received personal information from a child under the age of 13, Pinger will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.

**Information Pinger Collects and Uses**

Pinger collects information when you use and access Pinger’s products, services and website. We categorize the information we collect into three categories (collectively referred to as “Customer Information”): Personal Information, App Data and Share Data.

“Personal Information” is information about you that is personally identifiable, including your full name, business or residential address, email address, land-line or existing mobile phone number, or billing information.

“App Data” is information about the nature of your usage of Pinger’s website and products and services and non-personal information. App Data can include: IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system

information, unique device identifiers, such as UDID and/or Ethernet MAC address, date/time stamp, clickstream data and information about actions taken by you through interaction with Pinger’s products and/or advertising displayed within Pinger products, messages sent and received using Pinger services, information about those messages (date, duration, recipients, size, attachments), type of device, location information, age, gender, type of web browser, one or more cookies that identify your browser, and telecommunications carrier information.

“Share Data” is data and information you provide for use with Pinger’s products or services, such as text, audio, video and photos you make available through the Apps or contacts you add or import for use with Pinger products, and which may be made available to third parties by your actions when using Pinger products or services.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Pinger uses Customer Information to enhance your use of the Pinger services by processing such information for various purposes, including improving and providing Pinger’s products and services, product notifications, delivering advertisements and related links, for sending, sharing and storing your Share Data as you direct through use of Pinger products and services, and other purposes relating to offering you Pinger products and services.

If you provide your phone number as part of a request for information about Pinger products or services or in setting up an account, we may use that phone number and share that phone number with third parties to contact you about Pinger products and services and to provide advertisements to you about Pinger Products and services.

**Pinger does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information except as provided above and unless: you initiate the sharing through the Pinger products, services or website; you have provided your express consent; and in the following circumstances:**

(i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending requested postal mail and e-mail, SMS, MMS, and voice communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information), and providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner. These third parties may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes.

(ii) Pinger may share App Data and certain aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, but such information does not include your name, email address or any other Personal Information.

(iii) Pinger may share Customer Information to respond to legal requirements, when legally required to do so, or at the request of governmental authorities.

(iv) Pinger may share Customer Information to verify or enforce compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against fraud, to detect and prevent security or technical issues, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Pinger products, services, computing systems, or website, or to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Pinger, its subscribers or the public.

(v) Pinger may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization provided that use of Customer Information is in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

(vi) Pinger may share your Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from that third party through Pinger products or services. Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such user information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreements with you, if any, as well as their own privacy policies and as authorized and agreed upon by you as part of agreements for use of our products and services. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and

privacy policies. You acknowledge that Pinger shall have no liability to you for sharing of such information to such third parties as authorized by you and Pinger disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. If Pinger desires to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you the opportunity to opt out of such use for those other purposes.

**Cookies and Tracking**

When you visit Pinger or use Pinger applications, we may send cookies to your computer that uniquely identify your browser or use tracking pixels, agents or other visitor identification technology (collectively, “Tags”) that collect App Data. We may also include Tags in promotional materials in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

We use and share App Data as provided above.

Most browsers allow you to disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to utilize certain Pinger products and services.

We use analytics tools provided by Google, Facebook, Flurry, adjust, braze and Crashlytics (“Analytics Tools”) which also use Tags to collect and analyze information about your use of our desktop and mobile applications. We use Analytics Tools to collect App Data, which we use as provided above. That information is also used by the Analytics Tools providers according to their privacy policies.

In some Apps we use Google Signals, which is an extension to Google Analytics. If you have enabled personalized ads in your Google account, then Google Signals allows us access to data linked to your Google account for advertising reports, remarketing, cross-device reporting, and interest and demographic reports, and to use that data for cross-device remarketing.

You can find more details about how Google uses data it collects here: [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). Some applications may use Google Contacts API to allow access to your contacts using [https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts). That information is stored on your device and not uploaded to our servers, and is used solely to allow you to communicate with contacts using the features of those applications. For more, see [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and [https://console.cloud.google.com/tos?id=universal](https://console.cloud.google.com/tos?id=universal). To learn how Flurry collects, uses, and stores such information, see the Flurry privacy policy at [https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm](https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm). You may choose to opt out of the Flurry services via the Flurry Opt-Out Page, available at [https://dev.flurry.com/secure/optOut.do](https://dev.flurry.com/secure/optOut.do). To learn more about data collection with Facebook Analytics, see [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/analytics/overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/analytics/overview). To learn more about how braze uses data it collects, see [https://www.braze.com/terms/](https://www.braze.com/terms/). Crashlytics privacy policy can be found at [http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf](http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf). To opt out of Google Analytics and Google Signals, see [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

You hereby expressly consent that we are entitled to: (i) place Tags for the above-mentioned uses on your computer or device and to use the information gathered from Tags as provided in this Privacy Policy; and (ii) utilize information first party information and information provided by third parties for personalization and cross-device remarketing.

Currently, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” browser features.

**Security and Data Integrity**

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Customer Information under our control. Customer Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is accessible only by authorized Pinger personnel, contractors, and agents bound by confidentiality obligations and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Privacy Policy. Our processing of Personal Information is only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Periodically, Pinger undertakes a review of its privacy practices to ensure that that the information we collect is needed to provide or improve the services we provide.

**Links to Third Party Sites**

As a convenience to you, we may provide links and/or connections to third-party web sites or services from within our website or our products or services. Pinger is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.

**Access/Removal of Your Personal Information**

If you want us to remove your Personal Information from our database, or would like to access the Personal Information we have that was collected from you, you can contact us using the contact information provided below. Certain of our products and services require the use of App Data and such data is retained by Pinger and used as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Modifications of Privacy Policy**

Pinger reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such change, update or modification on the Pinger website and in the app stores from which Apps are made available. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon notice, which Pinger may provide by any means, including, without limitation, posting on the Pinger website, notifications within Pinger applications, or electronic mail. Your continued use of the Pinger website and/or any Pinger products and services following the posting of changes will mean you accept those changes. Use of information that we gather is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please send us an email at [info@pinger.com](mailto:info@pinger.com) or write to us at Pinger, Inc. 97 S. 2nd St, Ste. 210, San Jose, CA 95113. If we receive formal privacy-related complaints, it is our policy to use reasonable efforts to communicate with the complaining party about its concerns to resolve privacy complaints.

**Interest-Based Advertiser Opt Outs**

Pinger is not a member of any self-regulatory bodies for interest-based advertising like the DAA and NAI, but some of our advertisers and advertising services providers are members of self-regulatory bodies and require that we provide you with the following out links to the NAI and DAA opt out programs: for the NAI, see [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), and for the DAA, see [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

Privacy Notice

SOME USEFUL DATA PRIVACY FACTS FROM YOUR FRIENDS AT PINGER

We’ve provided this Privacy Notice to help you understand how Pinger, Inc. (“Pinger,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects and uses personal information and, for California residents, to inform them of the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which the categories of personal information will be used, as required under the California Consumer Privacy Act, as augmented by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, “CCPA”) and other relevant privacy laws.

The technologies we use process data for our products and services are complicated, but this Privacy Notice is meant to provide you with an easy-to-understand overview of the categories of personal information we collect, why we collect them, and how we use them. While this Privacy Notice provides a general overview, for a complete understanding about what personal information we gather and how we use it, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.pinger.com/privacy-policy/) and [Terms of Service](https://www.pinger.com/privacy-policy/terms-and-conditions/). Also, please review our “Notice of Financial Incentive” included below.

What does Pinger do?

Pinger offers software applications for iOS and Android mobile devices (and limited versions of those applications for internet-connected desktop computers), that enable end users to send SMS and MMS communications as well as to place or receive calls. Pinger licenses its applications to U.S.-based end users for use in the U.S. Pinger’s Canadian subsidiary, Dinopilot, offers the some of the same applications and functionality in limited markets outside of the U.S. If you’re an end user licensed by Dinopilot, references to “Pinger,” “we,” “us,” or “our” in this Privacy Notice mean Dinopilot.

Pinger’s mobile applications are: “Pinger,” “TextFree,” “TextFree Voice,” “Sideline”, and “Index” (collectively, the “Apps”). The Apps are available in iOS and/or Android versions for tablets and smartphones and are distributed through Apple’s “App Store” and the “Google Play” store (collectively, “App Stores”). Pinger, TextFree and TextFree Voice (collectively, “TextFree Apps”) are supported by advertising revenue and are free to use, with certain additional features, including an advertising-free feature, available for purchase as part of our TextFree Plus subscription. Sideline and Index require a paid subscription but may include promotional placements.

TextFree Apps provide end users with access to a Pinger-supplied phone number that becomes associated with an end user’s account. Receiving and sending SMS and MMS messages through the TextFree Apps are free to users as are inbound calls. However, placing outbound calls requires end users to either purchase license credits for outbound calling through App Stores, or earn license credits for outbound calling by viewing video ads (each ad view typically equates to one minute of license credits) or completing third party offers.

Sideline is a subscription-based, communications software platform intended for individuals. Specifically, Sideline provides phone numbers, voicemail, voicemail to text, inbound call routing functionality, multi-device call notification, text messaging, and telephone number management. Sideline provides its subscribers with communications tools to leverage their own devices and wireless plans.

Index is a subscription-based software platform intended for small businesses. Specifically, Index provides text-based tools such as booking appointments, sending invoices, collecting payments, and getting reviews. In addition, Index also provides phone numbers, voicemail, voicemail to text, inbound call routing functionality, multi-device call notification, text messaging, and telephone number management.

Sideline and Index may include promotional offers which may require that you allow use of your personal information. That information is only shared if you decide to pursue the offer, but you can opt out of receiving those offers by changing your “Content Preferences” through the “Settings” of the applicable App.

**What personal information does Pinger need to use?**

In order for inbound or outbound calls and messages to work for our Sideline, Index, and TextFree Apps, we need basic information about the sender and the recipient, namely their phone numbers. We also need to know how to associate all those calls and messages with a specific account for those Apps, so we require you to provide some basic information during signup. That’s how we can make sure that calls and messages are connected correctly. That information is required in order for us to provide our services, so please keep that in mind when deciding whether to use our Apps.

Since our TextFree Apps are supported by advertising, we -like other ad-supported companies (e.g. Facebook) – gather information about you, your mobile device from the TextFree Apps, and your use of TextFree Apps. That information is shared with Advertising Companies who process it and match it with other data and use algorithms to serve ads that are more relevant to you. That’s basically how we, and others, make money to support and offer TextFree Apps for free. Please keep in mind that some of that information, such as specific geo-location information, passes to Advertising Companies and may not be retained by us.

**Can I opt out of the sale of my personal information?**

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), provision of personal information to our advertising service providers may constitute a “sale” of that information, so for CCPA purposes, we consider that we “sell” your personal information to deliver ads in our TextFree Apps. If you don’t like that personal information is used to deliver ads to you in our TextFree Apps, then you can opt out by purchasing a TextFree Plus subscription from the applicable Apps Stores. For Sideline and Index, you can always opt out of receiving promotional offers and other content by going to your app settings and turning off content notifications.

**NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE:** If you’re a California resident, you should know that the TextFree Plus subscription is offered in compliance with Section 1798.125(a)(2) of the CCPA which allows us to charge a fee if we can’t generate any advertising revenue from your use of the TextFree Apps. That fee is a good faith estimate of the value of the advertising revenue for a typical user of the TextFree Apps as determined by an industry standard calculation of lifetime value of a user who views our ads as compared to the lifetime value of a typical user who purchases TextFree Plus.

When you purchase a TextFree Plus subscription, we don’t provide your personal information to Advertising Companies, but you have to maintain that subscription in order to continue using TextFree Plus because other versions of TextFree use your personal information for advertising purposes. If you wish to cancel your TextFree Plus subscription as a financial incentive to not have your personal information used for advertising, you will have to do so from the Apple or Google Play store. If you cancel or let the TextFree Plus subscription lapse, then your personal information will be used for advertising in the TextFree Apps and, by allowing the subscription to lapse, you are expressly consenting to our use of your personal information for advertising within the TextFree Apps.

**What categories of third parties does Pinger engage?**

While Pinger maintains its own data servers for the core data management for the Apps, we engage third parties to provide other services, as follows: (i) .”Backend Providers” provide the backend transmission systems necessary for the Apps to function and include local exchange carriers connected to the PSTN (Public Switch Telephone Network) who connect communications for us, data backhaul providers who transfer data across the continent, and hosting providers; (ii) “Service Providers” who provide analytics, calendar, user notification, and related business services and customer support platforms; and (iii) “Advertising Companies” who provide advertising services for our TextFree Apps. We have contractual agreements with those third parties that limit the use of personal information we control for the specific purpose identified in those agreements.

**What categories of personal information does Pinger collect?**

Some data we collect from our Apps and our websites at textfree.us, Pinger.com, Sideline.com, and Getindex.com (collectively, the “Site”) is “personal information” under the CCPA because it identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device. Currently, we collect this information from you and your device. Since paid features of our Apps are purchased through App Stores, we don’t collect any financial information from you, but we do collect other categories of personal information.

_Please note that as a company in the communications space, we receive regular requests from law enforcement and governmental authorities investigating wrongdoing or illegal activity and, accordingly, we retain specific information for longer periods, in part to honor the needs of law enforcement and governmental authorities._

Below is a summary of the categories of personal information we may have collected from consumers within the last twelve (12) months and the main purpose for its collection. Please note that we only collect personal information from you when you use our Apps, the Site or interact with our customer support personnel. Also, not all the information identified below is collected from every end user and not all information is personal to the user or is associated with a specific user.

Where users of our TextFree Apps have indicated that they are under the age of 16, we don’t sell their personal information and their account is terminated.

**What are other uses of personal information?**

As noted above, we use personal information to provide our services. In addition, we may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:

* To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.
* To provide you with alerts and other notices concerning our products or services.
* To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights under the Apps’ Terms of Service.
* For testing, research, analysis and product development to improve our Apps and Site.
* To protect the rights, property or safety of us, our subscribers or others and to respond to legal requests.
* As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.
* For the other purposes set forth in our Privacy Policy.

**Where is the data held?**

Pinger utilizes data centers in the United States, where all of our necessary systems are located. Some of our support programs leverage affiliated companies in the European Union (EU) to provide customer support, and those European-based customer support teams may have remote access to account information, but they do not store that information. Transfers of personal data to and among our affiliates are subject to terms of intercompany agreements governing the transfer of data to the United States and protection of that data under applicable law. Also, we require that you acknowledge and agree to allow us to transfer data to the United States, so if you’re not willing to provide that consent, you shouldn’t use our products and services.

**What safeguards does Pinger utilize to protect data?**

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures for our systems to comply with data privacy to ensure a level of data protection appropriate to the risk resulting from the processing of personal data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the severity and likelihood of realization of risks for the rights and freedoms of folks who’ve provided the data.

**Is Pinger a “controller” or a “processor”?**

Lots of companies are making distinctions between who is a “controller,” and who is a “processor,” when it comes to using personal data. That’s because the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) distinguishes a “controller,” (the party primarily responsible for protecting “personal data”) from a “processor” (which is essentially a subcontractor that has secondary, but important responsibilities to protect “personal data”). In the context of providing services to you, Pinger would be considered a “controller” if GDPR were to apply. However, currently you are not allowed to use our applications in the EU.

**What are my rights as a California resident?**

The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information, as described below.

_Opt Out of the Sale of Personal Information_

The CCPA requires that we notify you of your right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. As noted above, for our Sideline and Index mobile applications, we don’t sell your personal information as contemplated under the CCPA, so there’s no need for you to opt out of the sale of your personal information for those Apps.

For our TextFree Apps, as noted above you can opt out of the sale of personal information by purchasing a TextFree Plus subscription, subject to the conditions noted above.

_Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights_

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Note that you may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

* The categories of personal information we collected about you.
* The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
* The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
* If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose:
    * The categories of personal information that we’ve sold about you and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold.
    * The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose.

_Deletion Request Rights_

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

As discussed above, we can’t provide any services to you without your personal information, so if you ask us to delete your personal information, we will have to terminate your account and you will no longer be able to use the Apps for their intended purpose.

If you still want us to delete your personal information, you have to send us a verified request for us to do so. As with information requests, the only way for us to verify who you are is for you to log in and contact us using our Apps. TextFree, TextFree Voice, and Pinger users click on this link for how to contact us for deletion requests: [Delete My Data](https://messages.textfree.us/login?privacy=ccpa). Sideline users click on this link for how to contact us for deletion requests: [Delete My Data](https://messages.sideline.com/login?privacy=ccpa). Index users click on this link for how to contact us for deletion requests: [Delete My Data](https://app.getindex.com/login?privacy=ccpa).

Please note that the CCPA includes a number of exceptions that allow us to retain your personal data despite your deletion request, so we may retain your personal data under those exceptions.

**Why do I have to log in and contact you to make CCPA requests?**

As noted above, since we don’t require a lot of information for you to use our Apps, and since we may not verify the accuracy of the personal information you provide, we may not have sufficient data to verify who you are unless you log in and contact us using our Apps or provide us with the requested information. If you log in and contact us using our Apps, we can associate your request with a specific account and then take action on your request.

**What do I do if I have concerns about the use of my data?**

If you have concerns about the use of your data, contact us at [privacy@pinger.com](mailto:privacy@pinger.com). Please review our [Privacy Policy](https://pinger.com/privacy-policy/) for specific details about what is required of you when you contact us. And please remember that the choice to use our products is entirely yours: if you’re not comfortable with letting us use personal information as described in this Privacy Notice, in our [Privacy Policy](https://pingerdev.wpengine.com/privacy-policy/), and in our [Terms of Service](https://pingerdev.wpengine.com/privacy-policy/end-user-terms/#terms), then please don’t download our Apps.

Overview

This Data Protection Policy describes how Pinger treats data, including personal data, which it collects and receives related to your use of Pinger’s products, services, and websites.

Pinger collects data when you use and access Pinger’s products, services and websites. The information collected includes Personal Data, App Data, Traffic Data and Share Data (collectively, “Customer Information”). “Personal Data” is information provided by you which can be used to directly identify you, like your full name, address, email address, billing information, home phone number, and home and business addresses. No Personal Data is collected when you merely access the public areas of our websites. “App Data” is information about the nature of your usage of Pinger’s websites and products and services and non-personal demographic information. App Data includes: IP addresses, domain servers, referring/exit pages, operating system information, type of web browser, date/time stamp, and clickstream data; and for Pinger products and services App Data also includes device identifiers, messages sent and received using Pinger services, information about those messages, type of device, location information, user age and gender demographics, browser type, carrier information, and information and statistics about use of Pinger product features. “Share Data” is data you provide for use with Pinger’s products or services and which may be made available to third parties by your actions when using Pinger products or services.

**Use and Processing of Information; Sharing and Disclosure**

Pinger uses and processes Customer Information to provide, improve and modify Pinger products and services, to authenticate users, to provide customer service and support, to communicate with users through Pinger products and services, to publish and provide advertising through our products and services, for Pinger product notifications, for fraud detection and compliance with user agreements, and for sending, sharing and storing your Share Data as you direct through use of Pinger products and services. Pinger processes Customer Information, including Personal Data, on our servers in the United States of America and additional countries where we may add servers.  In some cases, we may process Customer Information on behalf of, through, or according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners, but only when you have provided your express, informed and revocable consent to allow us to do so.

Pinger does not rent, sell, or share any Customer Information unless we have your express informed consent and in the following circumstances:

(i) Pinger may engage a trusted third party to perform limited functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling newsletter subscriptions, sending and receiving requested postal mail, e-mail, SMS, MMS, and voice communications, analyzing and processing data (such as billing information) and ad serving, and providing customer service. We require that these parties agree to use such information in a confidential manner and in compliance with this Data Protection Policy. These third parties may have access to Personal Data needed to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use it for other purposes without your consent except as required by applicable law.

(ii) Pinger may share with third parties App Data and non-personal information which does not identify you individually.

(iii) Pinger may share Customer Information to respond to legal requirements, when legally required to do so, and at the request of governmental authorities.

(iv) Pinger may share Customer Information to verify or enforce compliance with user agreements and applicable laws, to protect against fraud, to detect and prevent security or technical issues, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Pinger products, services, computing systems, or websites, or to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Pinger, its subscribers or the public.

(v) Pinger may share Customer Information with a successor entity or in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization provided that use of Customer Information is in compliance with this Data Protection Policy.

(vi) Pinger may share Customer Information with a third party if you have consented to receive information from, or share it with, that third party through Pinger products or services. Such third parties will handle, store, retain and access such Customer Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of their agreements with you, if any, as well as their own data protection policies. It is your responsibility to carefully review such agreements and data protection policies. You acknowledge that Pinger shall have no liability to you for sharing of such information to such third parties and Pinger disclaims any and all liability relating thereto.

(vii) In order to provide software and services to you, Pinger may share Customer Information with its parent and/or subsidiary companies within and without the European Union and those parties may process and store Customer Information in any country in the world subject to this Data Protection Policy.

When you visit Pinger, we may send cookies to your computer that uniquely identify your browser or use pixel tags (sometimes referred to as web beacons) to record pages visited. We use cookies and tags to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking usage information. Most browsers allow you to disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. We may also include tags in promotional materials in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. You hereby expressly consent that Pinger is entitled to place these cookies and tags for the above-mentioned services on your computer or device.

Traffic data  

Telecommunications traffic data (“Traffic Data”) is collected in connection with your use of the Pinger services and is stored after the end of the communication for billing purposes up to the maximum periods authorized by applicable law and will be deleted thereafter, unless (i) you have raised objections against the billing, or (ii) if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraud or of other criminal activity. For the purposes of law enforcement, Traffic Data is also stored in compliance with applicable law for data retention. Traffic Data stored pursuant to this second sentence cannot be used by you for the purposes of a billing dispute.

**Security and Data Integrity**

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Customer Information under our control. Customer Information we collect is stored in a secure manner that is accessible only by authorized Pinger personnel, contractors, and agents bound by confidentiality obligations and is only disclosed under the provisions of this Data Protection Policy. Our processing of Personal Data is only for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise in accordance with this Data Protection Policy and applicable EU and national data protection laws. Periodically, Pinger undertakes a review of its privacy practices to ensure that that the information we collect is needed to provide or improve the services we provide.

Children’s Personal Information  

The Pinger websites comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Pinger does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13 through the Pinger websites. In addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the Pinger websites, Pinger will not collect, store or use any Personal Data of such user. Further, in the event that Pinger receives Personal Data that Pinger discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, Pinger will promptly delete such Personal Data in a secure manner.

**Links to Third Party Sites**

As a convenience to you, we may provide links and/or connections to third-party web sites or services from within our websites or our products or services. Pinger is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.

If you want us to remove your Personal Data from our database, or would like to access the Personal Data that was collected from you, you can contact us using the contact information provided below. Upon termination of the Pinger services, your Personal Data will be deleted. Certain of our products and services require the use of App Data and such data is retained by Pinger and used as described in this Data Protection Policy and in end user agreements for the applicable products and services.

**Modifications of Data Protection Policy**

Pinger reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, update or modify this Data Protection Policy at any time by posting such change, update or modification on the Pinger websites, which will be effective immediately upon notice, which Pinger may provide by any means, including, without limitation, posting on the Pinger websites, notifications within Pinger applications, or electronic mail. Your continued use of the Pinger websites and/or any Pinger products and services following the posting of changes will mean you accept those changes. Use of information that we gather is subject to the Data Protection Policy in effect at the time of use.

Contact Us  

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Data Protection Policy, such as what Personal Data is stored about you, please send us an email at [info@pinger.com](mailto:info@pinger.com). If we receive formal privacy-related complaints, it is our policy to use reasonable efforts to communicate with the complaining party about its concerns to resolve privacy complaints. For the purposes of this Data Protection Policy, “Pinger” shall mean either Pinger (UK) Ltd. or Pinger International Ltd., depending upon which entity’s user agreement you have accepted.

Generalidades

Esta Política de protección de la información describe la forma en que Pinger trata la información, incluso los datos personales, que es recopilada y recibida en relación con su uso de productos, servicios y sitios web de Pinger.

No se recopila información personal cuando usted solamente accede a las áreas públicas de nuestros sitios web. La “información de aplicaciones” es aquella sobre la naturaleza de su uso de los sitios web, productos y servicios de Pinger, así como información demográfica no personal. La información de aplicaciones incluye: Direcciones de protocolo de Internet (IP), servidores de dominio, páginas referenciales/de salida, información del sistema operativo, tipo de navegador web, sello de fecha/hora e información sobre el flujo de visitas; y para los productos y servicios de Pinger, la información de aplicaciones también incluye identificadores de dispositivos, mensajes enviados y recibidos utilizando los servicios de Pinger, información sobre aquellos mensajes, tipo de dispositivo, información de ubicación, edad del usuario y demografía de sexo, tipo de navegador, información de la portadora e información y estadísticas sobre el uso de las aplicaciones del producto de Pinger.

Pinger procesa la Información del cliente, incluida la información personal, que figura en nuestros servidores en Estados Unidos de Norteamérica y en los países adicionales donde podamos añadir servidores.  En algunos casos, podemos procesar Información del cliente a nombre de, a través de, o de acuerdo a las indicaciones de un tercero, como nuestros socios publicistas, pero solo cuando usted nos ha proporcionado su consentimiento expreso, informado e irrevocable para hacerlo. Pinger no alquila, vende o distribuye la Información del cliente, a menos que contemos con su consentimiento expreso informado y conforme a las siguientes circunstancias: (i) Pinger puede involucrar a un tercero de confianza para que lleve a cabo funciones limitadas en nuestra representación, como llenar suscripciones para boletines informativos, enviar y recibir correspondencia solicitada, ya sea por correo postal, electrónico, mensajes de texto telefónico e informático y comunicaciones de voz, así como brindar servicio al cliente, analizar y procesar información (como información de facturación) y suministrar información publicitaria. Nosotros exigimos que estas partes acepten utilizar dicha información en forma confidencial y en cumplimiento con esta Política de protección de la información. Estos terceros pueden tener acceso a la información personal necesaria para desempeñar sus funciones, pero no les permitimos utilizarla con otro propósito sin su consentimiento, excepto según sea exigido por la ley vigente. (ii) Pinger puede compartir información de aplicaciones e información no personal a terceros, la cual no lo identifique en forma individual. (iii) Pinger puede compartir Información del cliente para responder ante requerimientos legales, cuando le sea legalmente exigido hacerlo y a solicitud de las autoridades gubernamentales.

(v) Pinger puede compartir Información del cliente con una entidad sucesora o en relación con una fusión corporativa, consolidación, venta de activos u otro tipo de reorganización corporativa, siempre que el uso de la Información del cliente se haga en cumplimiento de esta Política de protección de la información. (vi) Pinger puede compartir Información del cliente con un tercero si usted ha consentido recibir información de, o compartirla con, ese tercero a través de los productos o servicios de Pinger. Tales terceros manejarán, almacenarán, conservarán y accederán a dicha Información del cliente de acuerdo a los términos y condiciones de sus acuerdos con usted, si los hubiera, así como de acuerdo a sus propias políticas de protección de la información. Es su responsabilidad revisar con atención dichos acuerdos y políticas de protección de la información. Usted reconoce que Pinger no tendrá responsabilidad ante usted por compartir dicha información a tales terceros y Pinger renuncia a toda responsabilidad relacionada con la misma. (vii) A fin de proporcionarle software y servicios, Pinger puede compartir Información del cliente con su casa matriz y/o subsidiarias dentro y fuera de la Unión Europea y esas partes pueden procesar y almacenar la Información del cliente en cualquier país del mundo, sujeto a esta Política de protección de la información.

**Huellas informáticas (cookies)**

Cuando usted visita Pinger, nosotros podemos enviar huellas informáticas a su computadora, las que identifican en forma única su navegador o etiquetas de píxeles (algunas veces denominadas balizas web) para registrar las páginas visitadas.

Pinger raccoglie dati quando l’utente accede ai prodotti, servizi e siti Web di Pinger. Le informazioni raccolte includono Dati personali, Dati di applicazione, traffico e condivisione (collettivamente, le “Informazioni del cliente”). I “Dati personali” sono informazioni fornite dall’utente che possono essere utilizzate per identificare direttamente la sua persona, come nome e cognome, indirizzo email, informazioni di fatturazione, recapito telefonico e indirizzo di abitazione e ufficio. I Dati personali non vengono raccolti quando si accede semplicemente alle aree pubbliche dei nostri siti Web.

I Dati di applicazione includono: indirizzi IP, server di dominio, pagine di riferimento/uscita, informazioni sul sistema operativo, tipo di browser Web, indicatore di data/ora, e dati clickstream; per quanto riguarda i prodotti e i servizi di Pinger, i Dati di applicazione includono anche identificatori di dispositivo, messaggi inviati e ricevuti usando i servizi Pinger, informazioni relative a questi messaggi, tipo di dispositivo, informazioni sulla posizione, dati demografici relativi all’età e al sesso dell’utente, tipo di browser, informazioni sul vettore, e informazioni e statistiche sull’uso delle funzionalità dei prodotti Pinger. I “Dati di condivisione” sono dati forniti dall’utente per utilizzare i prodotti e i servizi Pinger, e che potrebbero essere rese disponibili a terzi in seguito ad azioni dell’utente stesso durante l’uso dei prodotti o servizi di Pinger.

**Utilizzo ed elaborazione delle informazioni; Condivisione e divulgazione**

Pinger utilizza ed elabora le Informazioni del cliente per fornire, migliorare e modificare i prodotti e servizi di Pinger, per autenticare gli utenti, fornire assistenza e servizio alla clientela, per comunicare con gli utenti mediante i suoi prodotti e servizi, per pubblicare e fornire materiale pubblicitario mediante i suoi prodotti e servizi, per le notifiche sui suoi prodotti, per il rilevamento di frodi e la conformità ai contratti con l’utente, e per inviare, condividere e memorizzare i Dati di condivisione dell’utente mediante l’uso di prodotti e servizi Pinger. Pinger elabora le Informazioni del cliente, inclusi i dati personali, sui nostri server negli Stati Uniti d’America e in eventuali altri Paesi in cui potremmo aggiungere i nostri server. In alcuni casi, potremmo elaborare le Informazioni del cliente in nome e per conto di, o conformemente alle indicazioni di una terza parte, come ad esempio i nostri partner pubblicitari, ma solo se l’utente abbia fornito espressamente il proprio consenso informato e revocabile per agire in tal senso.

Pinger non cede, vende, né condivide le Informazioni del cliente a meno che non abbia ricevuto l’esplicito consenso informato dell’utente, e nelle seguenti circostanze:

(i) Pinger può assumere una terza parte di fiducia per svolgere funzioni limitate a suo nome, tra cui il completamento delle iscrizioni alla newsletter, l’invio e la ricezione di posta ordinaria, posta elettronica, SMS, MMS, e comunicazioni vocali, l’analisi e l’elaborazione di dati (ad esempio le informazioni di fatturazione), l’ad serving, e la fornitura del servizio clienti. Pretendiamo che tali terze parti accettino di usare dette informazioni in modo riservato e conforme alla Politica sulla protezione dei dati in oggetto. Le terze parti di cui sopra possono accedere ai Dati personali necessari per svolgere le loro funzioni; tuttavia non permettiamo loro di utilizzarli per altri scopi senza il consenso dell’utente, salvo quanto previsto dalle leggi in vigore.

(ii) Pinger può condividere con le terze parti i Dati di applicazione e le informazioni non personali che non identificano personalmente l’utente.

(iii) Pinger può condividere le Informazioni del cliente per soddisfare i requisiti legali, se previsto dalla legge, e su richiesta di agenzie governative.

(iv) Pinger può condividere le Informazioni del cliente per verificare o imporre la conformità ai contratti con l’utente e alle leggi in vigore, per applicare la protezione contro le frodi, rilevare ed evitare problemi tecnici o sulla sicurezza, per impedire l’uso improprio o non autorizzato dei prodotti, servizi, sistemi informatici o siti Web di Pinger, o per impedire la violazione dei diritti, delle proprietà o della sicurezza di Pinger, dei suoi utenti o del pubblico.

(v) Pinger può condividere le Informazioni del cliente con un successore o in relazione ad una fusione aziendale, consolidamento, vendita di beni o altri tipi di riorganizzazione aziendale, a condizione che l’uso delle Informazioni del cliente sia conforme alla presente Politica sulla protezione dei dati.

(vi) Pinger può condividere le Informazioni del cliente con una terza parte nel caso in cui l’utente abbia fornito il proprio consenso per ricevere informazioni da, o condividerle con tale terza parte mediante i prodotti o servizi Pinger. Tali terze parti potranno gestire, archiviare, conservare e accedere alle Informazioni del cliente conformemente ai termini e condizioni dei loro accordi con l’utente, ove presenti, oltre che alle relative politiche sulla protezione dei dati. È responsabilità dell’utente esaminare attentamente tali accordi e le politiche sulla protezione dei dati. L’utente conviene che Pinger non avrà responsabilità nei suoi confronti relativamente alla condivisione di tali informazioni con terze parti, e che Pinger declina qualsiasi responsabilità a riguardo.

Ai fini dell’applicazione di legge, i Dati di traffico vengono inoltre memorizzati conformemente alla legislazione vigente in materia di conservazione dei dati. I Dati di traffico archiviati ai sensi di questo secondo paragrafo non potranno essere utilizzati dall’utente per la risoluzione di una controversia relativa alla fatturazione.

**Sicurezza e integrità dei dati**

Disponiamo di sistemi di tutela fisica, elettronica e procedurale per impedire la perdita, l’uso improprio e l’alterazione delle Informazioni del cliente in nostro possesso. Le Informazioni del cliente da noi raccolte vengono memorizzate in modo sicuro e sono accessibili solo da personale, appaltatori e agenti autorizzati da Pinger, vincolati da obblighi di riservatezza; inoltre tali informazioni vengono divulgate solo ai sensi delle disposizioni contenute nella presente Politica sulla protezione dei dati.
