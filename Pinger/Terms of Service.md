* Licensor, Outbound Provider and Inbound Provider (both defined below) enable only the transmission of calls and messages through Apps and Services.
* If you send spam or initiate messages or calls in violation of applicable laws or this document, you could be liable for significant liquidated damages.
* If you have a subscription, you have to follow specific procedures to cancel the subscription.

**Apps are Not for Children under 16**. All Apps, Services and Pinger websites are not intended for children under the age of 16, so children under the age of 16 should not use them at any time. If you are under 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms. Licensor does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 16. In the event that Licensor learns that it has inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 16, Licensor will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such information.

**Applicability**. These terms incorporate by reference the terms made available by the particular app store from which you downloaded the App (“App Store”) applicable to apps downloaded from that App Store, if any (“App Store Terms”). These terms also incorporate by reference the Privacy Policy. These terms control in the event of any conflict with the Privacy Policy or the App Store Terms. Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider each, respectively, reserve the right to change, modify or update these terms and the License, the Inbound Terms and the Outbound Terms embodied herein, at any time by posting revised versions at [https://pinger.staging.wpengine.com](https://pinger.staging.wpengine.com/) (“Pinger Site”) and you agree that posting of such updates constitutes sufficient notice to you regarding such updates. Your download of other Apps or your continued use of Apps and Services following posting of updates on the Pinger Site constitutes your acceptance of the same.

**Construction**. Some Apps and Services have unique features and, as a consequence, these terms create three separate contracts: (i) a license between you and Licensor (the “License”) for your use of the Apps and communication features only available between App users (“On-Net Features”), (ii) where the App provides temporary use of a unique phone number, a separate agreement between you and the party identified as the “Inbound Provider” below, for the use of the Inbound Services described below (the “Inbound Terms”), and (iii) where the App allows for outbound SMS and/or calling features, a separate agreement between you and the party identified as the “Outbound Provider” below, for the use of the Outbound Service described below (the “Outbound Terms”). The term “SMS” as used in this document means a message of text only or text and graphics, photos, audio clips, or video clips as enabled by the applicable App. Depending on your App, it may not include functionality for including graphics, photos, audio clips, or video clips as part of messages.

**You are the Maker and Initiator of Calls and Messages**. Licensor, Outbound Provider and Inbound Provider (both defined below) enable only the transmission of calls and messages through Apps and Services.  They do not initiate or make calls or messages, and do not have any authority to do make or initiate calls or messages, whether express or implied, except through any auto reply features that you’ve enabled through the App.  You, as a subscriber, are the maker and initiator of the calls and messages sent by you through the Apps and Services, including auto replies that you enable through the App, and you are solely responsible for all of those calls and messages.

**Account Registration**. Use of most Apps requires that you create an account (the “Account”). When setting up an Account: (i) you may be prompted to provide a phone number to receive a call or SMS from us so that we may authenticate your Account registration and you acknowledge and agree that we may place, and that your provider may charge you for, that incoming call or SMS; and (ii) you are prompted for registration information, which may include your country of residence, name, age, email address, and account password, and a phone number.

Accounts are for your personal use and may not be transferred or assigned by you to a third party. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO MAKE YOUR CONTACTS AVAILABLE TO THE APP, YOU CANNOT REGISTER AN ACCOUNT AND YOUR USE OF THE APPS WILL BE LIMITED.

**Third Party Features; Open Source Software**. There may be times when App features are offered by third parties who provide those features under their own terms and conditions not included in these terms. Those separate terms and conditions would govern your use of such features.

The provisions of these terms up to and including this paragraph are referred to as the “Base Terms.”

You acknowledge and agree that international calls are subject to call time and geographic limitations and may be further limited and/or restricted by Licensor and/or Outbound Provider in its or their sole discretion at any time and without notice or liability to you.

Those features are not otherwise available in free versions of Licensor applications. Licensor may also make available account features which allow the use of multiple phone numbers by multiple individuals under one master account (“Sideline Enterprise”). The following provisions apply to such paid versions of Sideline and Sideline Enterprise (collectively, “Paid Accounts”).

a. Subscription Period: The subscription period for Paid Accounts shall be as stated when you elect to establish the Paid Account (“Subscription Period”). The Subscription Period shall automatically renew for additional Subscription Periods of equal duration until you cancel your Paid Account or Licensor terminates your Paid Account.

b. Account Setup: Sideline Accounts are established by the individual Sideline Account holder. Sideline Enterprise Accounts are set up by a group administrator (the “Admin”) who registers as the Admin, selects the quantity of phone numbers, and pays for the Subscription Fees. Licensor may limit, in its sole discretion, the number of Sideline Accounts that a single person or subscriber may establish or use, whether by preventing Account setup, by canceling Accounts, or otherwise. The Admin identifies members of the group by providing the name for each group member (each a “Group Member”) and other optional information for each Group Member. Each Group Member can then set up his/or her Sideline subaccount (each a “Group Member Account”) by following the account setup process for Group Members.

c. Subscription Fees. Paid Accounts are subject to fees based upon the account type and number of phone numbers allocated to your Paid Account (“Subscription Fees”). You agree to pay all applicable Subscription Fees. Depending on how you obtained your Paid Account, the applicable App Store or Licensor will charge your credit card the Subscription Fees for the type of account and number of phone numbers you’ve chosen, plus applicable taxes. Where you obtain a Paid Account from Licensor, Licensor or its billing processors collect billing information upon registration for a Paid Account and, as with other registration information, billing information is protected the Privacy Policy.

IF A FREE TRIAL IS OFFERED FOR THE APPLICABLE APP, YOU MUST CANCEL THAT SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL. For renewals, Licensor will automatically charge your credit card the amount of the then-current fee for your type of account and phone numbers used through your Paid Account, plus applicable taxes. Licensor reserves the right to charge value-added taxes, sales, or other taxes on the Paid Accounts as it deems appropriate, and reserves the right to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of Paid Accounts at any time (a) upon notice as allowed by applicable law, and, (b) if allowed by application law, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to you, either by (i) posting pricing plan changes on the Licensor website, or (ii) sending information regarding the pricing plan changes to the email address you provided Licensor. You are responsible for regularly reviewing such pricing information. Continued use of Paid Accounts or non-termination of your Paid Account after such notice constitutes your acceptance of the prices as modified. All payments are non-refundable. To the extent that payment mechanisms are provided through third parties, you agree that Licensor shall have no liability to you arising out of the acts or omissions of such third parties. BY CREATING A PAID ACCOUNT YOU CONSENT TO ALLOW LICENSOR, OR THE APPLICABLE APP STORE, TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ITS PAYMENT PROCESSORS, FOR THE AMOUNTS DUE FOR YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND FOR ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS UNTIL YOUR ACCOUNT IS CANCELED OR TERMINATED. IF YOU PURCHASE A SIDELINE SUBSCRIPTION DIRECTLY FROM LICENSOR (IF AND WHEN MADE AVAILABLE BY LICENSOR) UNLESS YOU NOTIFY LICENSOR OF ANY DISCREPANCIES WITH RESPECT TO PAID ACCOUNT BILLING WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THEY FIRST APPEAR ON YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT, YOU AGREE THAT THEY WILL BE DEEMED ACCEPTED BY YOU FOR ALL PURPOSES. IF LICENSOR DOES NOT RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD ISSUER OR ITS AGENT, YOU AGREE TO PAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE UPON DEMAND BY LICENSOR OR ITS AGENTS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY GOVERNMENTAL TAXES IMPOSED ON YOUR PURCHASES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SALES, USE OR VALUE-ADDED TAXES.

d. Sideline Enterprise Account Management: Using the Sideline Enterprise Account web management console, the Admin maintains exclusive control over the management of the Sideline Enterprise Account, such as adding or removing phone numbers. AS A GROUP MEMBER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT: (I) THE ADMIN MAINTAINS MANAGEMENT CONTROL OVER GROUP MEMBER ACCOUNTS; (II) THE ADMIN CONTROLS PORTING OUT OF PHONE NUMBERS FOR SIDELINE ENTERPRISE AND THAT NO GROUP MEMBER MAY PORT OUT PHONE NUMBERS CONTROLLED BY THE ADMIN; (III) THE ORGANIZATION WITH WHICH THE ADMIN IS ENGAGED IS THE HOLDER OF THE GROUP MEMBER ACCOUNT (THE “ORGANIZATION”) AND HAS RIGHTS TO VIEW AND ACCESS CALL DETAIL RECORDS, CONTACT DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH GROUP MEMBER ACCOUNTS, AND EACH GROUP MEMBER HEREBY GRANTS THE ORGANIZATION THE RIGHT TO DO SO, AND GRANTS LICENSOR THE RIGHT TO DISCLOSE SUCH INFORMATION TO THE ORGANIZATION UPON REQUEST; (IV) THE ADMIN CAN RETAKE THE PHONE NUMBER ASSIGNED TO YOUR SIDELINE ENTERPRISE GROUP MEMBER ACCOUNT; (V) THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP AND THE ADMIN CAN VIEW YOUR MESSAGES; AND (VI) LICENSOR, OUTBOUND PROVIDER AND INBOUND PROVIDER ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU FOR, ANY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE ADMIN WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, SIDELINE.

e. Sideline Enterprise Account Downgrades: The Admin can downgrade the Sideline Enterprise Account to a regular Sideline account by removing all phone numbers associated with the Sideline Enterprise Account. Downgrades are implemented immediately and there are no refunds of Subscription Fees. IF YOU ARE A GROUP MEMBER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION AS A GROUP MEMBER, AND YOUR GROUP MEMBER ACCOUNT, CAN BE TERMINATED BY THE ADMIN AT ANY TIME.

f. Cancelation. To cancel your Sideline subscription, you must cancel the recurring subscription through mechanisms made available by the applicable App Store provider. For subscriptions purchased through the Apple App Store, in the “Settings” feature, tap “App and iTunes Stores,” tap your Apple ID (you may need to sign in), under “Subscriptions” tap “Manage,” tap the subscription you want to manage, and use the options to manage your subscriptions. See [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) for detailed instructions on canceling your subscription. For subscriptions purchased through Google Play, go to payments.google.com, select “Bills and Accounts,” and select the subscription you want to cancel. See [https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2476088?hl=en](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2476088?hl=en) for details on canceling your subscription.

To cancel your Sideline Enterprise subscriptions, you must send a cancelation notice via email to [cancel@sideline.com](mailto:cancel@sideline.com).

IF YOU DEACTIVATE YOUR SIDELINE ACCOUNT USING THE MECHANISMS AVAILABLE IN THE SIDELINE APP, THE ACCOUNT BECOMES “INACTIVE” BUT IS NOT TERMINATED.  ONCE YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED, YOU MAY HAVE LIMITED USAGE OF THE APP (E.G. COMMUNICATION HISTORY) UNTIL YOUR RESTART A SUBSCRIPTION

IN ORDER TO COMPLETELY TERMINATE SIDELINE ACCOUNTS, FOR BOTH INACTIVE AND ACTIVE ACCOUNTS, YOU MUST SEND A CANCELATION NOTICE VIA EMAIL TO [CANCEL@SIDELINE.COM](mailto:cancel@sideline.com) STATING THAT YOU ARE TERMINATING YOUR USE OF SIDELINE COMPLETELY. 

AND IN ORDER TO TERMINATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MUST CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE APPLICABLE APP STORE AS PROVIDED ABOVE, UNLESS YOU PURCHASED A SUBSCRIPTION DIRECTLY THROUGH LICENSOR, IN WHICH CASE YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BY SENDING A SEND A CANCELATION NOTICE VIA EMAIL TO [CANCEL@SIDELINE.COM](mailto:cancel@sideline.com).

4\. Porting: Porting is enabled for Sideline only. By setting up a Sideline account, you are making a specific request to Licensor to establish a unique, confidential code to enable the porting process to port Inbound Provider’s number associated with your account, with the code only released to you upon a porting request initiated by you. Porting requests may be commenced through the App and, for Sideline Enterprise, through the Sideline Enterprise web management console and only by the Admin. For porting in of phone numbers you will be required to provide specific information in order for Licensor to submit the porting request to your carrier. For porting out of phone numbers, you may request a port-out PIN code through the App or, for Sideline Enterprise, through the Sideline Enterprise web management console, and then contact the carrier to which porting is to be made. Porting out requires that the number is for a Paid Account, with at least a Subscription Period of one month, or that the number you are porting out is a number that you previously ported into Sideline, and that you have not previously ported out a number for the Sideline Account or the applicable Group Member of a Sideline Enterprise Account. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) porting in or out may each be subject to an additional fee as allowed by applicable law and that you shall be required to pay such fees as required by Licensor; (ii) phone numbers belong to the Inbound Provider and are available for porting as a feature of a Paid Account; and (iii) porting is coordinated through Licensor’s local exchange carrier (the “CLEC”), so actual porting is not conducted by Licensor. Porting of phone numbers is subject to involvement, cooperation and consent of third parties, including the CLEC and the carriers from whom or to whom porting is requested.

Licensor reserves the right to charge value-added taxes, sales, or other taxes on the Paid Accounts as it deems appropriate, and reserves the right to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of Paid Accounts at any time (a) upon notice as allowed by applicable law, and, (b) if allowed by application law, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to you, either by (i) posting pricing plan changes on the Licensor website, or (ii) sending information regarding the pricing plan changes to the email address you provided Licensor. You are responsible for regularly reviewing such pricing information. Continued use of Paid Accounts or non-termination of your Paid Account after such notice constitutes your acceptance of the prices as modified. All payments are non-refundable. To the extent that payment mechanisms are provided through third parties, you agree that Licensor shall have no liability to you arising out of the acts or omissions of such third parties. BY CREATING A PAID ACCOUNT YOU CONSENT TO ALLOW LICENSOR, OR THE APPLICABLE APP STORE, TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ITS PAYMENT PROCESSORS, FOR THE AMOUNTS DUE FOR YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND FOR ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS UNTIL YOUR ACCOUNT IS CANCELED OR TERMINATED. IF YOU PURCHASE AN INDEX SUBSCRIPTION DIRECTLY FROM LICENSOR (IF AND WHEN MADE AVAILABLE BY LICENSOR) UNLESS YOU NOTIFY LICENSOR OF ANY DISCREPANCIES WITH RESPECT TO PAID ACCOUNT BILLING WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THEY FIRST APPEAR ON YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT, YOU AGREE THAT THEY WILL BE DEEMED ACCEPTED BY YOU FOR ALL PURPOSES. IF LICENSOR DOES NOT RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD ISSUER OR ITS AGENT, YOU AGREE TO PAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE UPON DEMAND BY LICENSOR OR ITS AGENTS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY GOVERNMENTAL TAXES IMPOSED ON YOUR PURCHASES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SALES, USE OR VALUE-ADDED TAXES.

d. Reviews. Your version of Index may include review request capabilities to solicit customer reviews from your customers on 3rd party services. If so, by using Index, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are the owner of the business for which you are soliciting customer reviews, (ii) you will not engage in deceiving practices to request reviews, (iii) you have the data privacy consent of the customer to solicit their review, and (iv) Pinger is not responsible for the reviews provided by your customers.

e. Appointments. Pinger will enable businesses to share their availability with their customers and to allow their customers to book appointments directly on their calendar. Pinger will also send appointment confirmations and reminders via email.

f. Payments. Your version of Index may include payment request capabilities to solicit payments from your customers via 3rd party payment providers. If so, by using Index, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you will only use Index to solicit payments for services that you have directly provided to your customers, (ii) any payment disputes with your customer shall be your responsibility to resolve and (iii) Pinger is not responsible for any payment collection or disputes.

g. Cancelation. To cancel your Index subscription, you must cancel the recurring subscription through mechanisms made available by the applicable App Store provider. For subscriptions purchased through the Apple App Store, in the “Settings” feature, tap “App and iTunes Stores,” tap your Apple ID (you may need to sign in), under “Subscriptions” tap “Manage,” tap the subscription you want to manage, and use the options to manage your subscriptions. See [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) for detailed instructions on canceling your subscription. For subscriptions purchased through Google Play, go to payments.google.com, select “Bills and Accounts,” and select the subscription you want to cancel. See [https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2476088?hl=en](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2476088?hl=en) for details on canceling your subscription.

IF YOU DEACTIVATE YOUR INDEX ACCOUNT USING THE MECHANISMS AVAILABLE IN THE INDEX APP, THE ACCOUNT BECOMES “INACTIVE” BUT IS NOT TERMINATED. ONCE YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED, YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE DELETED.

AND IN ORDER TO TERMINATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MUST CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE APPLICABLE APP STORE AS PROVIDED ABOVE.

4\. Porting: Porting is enabled for Index only. By setting up an Index account, you are making a specific request to Licensor to establish a unique, confidential code to enable the porting process to port Inbound Provider’s number associated with your account, with the code only released to you upon a porting request initiated by you. Porting requests may be commenced through the App. For porting in of phone numbers you will be required to provide specific information in order for Licensor to submit the porting request to your carrier. For porting out of phone numbers, you may request a port-out PIN code through the App and then contact the carrier to which porting is to be made. Porting out requires that the number is for a Paid Account, with at least a Subscription Period of one month, or that the number you are porting out is a number that you previously ported into Index, and that you have not previously ported out a number for the Index Account. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) porting in or out may each be subject to an additional fee as allowed by applicable law and that you shall be required to pay such fees as required by Licensor; (ii) phone numbers belong to the Inbound Provider and are available for porting as a feature of a Paid Account; and (iii) porting is coordinated through Licensor’s local exchange carrier (the “CLEC”), so actual porting is not conducted by Licensor. Porting of phone numbers is subject to involvement, cooperation and consent of third parties, including the CLEC and the carriers from whom or to whom porting is requested. Consequently, porting processes may take considerable time and may not be feasible or allowed, or may be blocked or withheld by third parties and that Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider shall not have any liability to you for any actions or failures to act by such parties. AS CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE INDEX APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT: (I) ANY PORTED OUT PHONE NUMBERS SHALL BE FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE AND WILL NOT BE RESOLD OR SUBLICENSED; AND (II) INBOUND PROVIDER, OUTBOUND PROVIDER, AND LICENSOR SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR THE INABILITY TO EITHER PORT IN OR PORT OUT A PHONE NUMBER, FOR ANY DELAY OR ERRORS IN FULFILLING A PORTING REQUEST, FOR ANY PHONE NUMBER SUBSTITUTION, OR FOR ANY LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE ARISING OUT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING. IN ADDITION, YOU MAY ONLY PORT OUT A NUMBER IF THE ACCOUNT IS ACTIVE AND THE PHONE NUMBER IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.
