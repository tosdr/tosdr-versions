* It is your sole obligation to comply with all laws, rules, regulations and governmental guidance in your use of the Apps and Services.
* You are the maker and initiator of the calls and messages sent by you through the Apps and Services, including but not limited to auto replies that you enable through the Apps, and you are solely responsible for all of those calls and messages.
* Licensor, Outbound Provider and Inbound Provider (both defined below) enable only the transmission of calls and messages through Apps and Services.
* If you send spam or initiate messages or calls in violation of applicable laws or this document, you could be liable for significant liquidated damages.
* If you have a subscription, you have to follow specific procedures to cancel the subscription.
* No warranties are provided to you, whether express or implied.
* If you provide Licensor with your cell phone number, you are providing your express consent to receive informational messages and to receive marketing messages from Licensor until you elect to opt out of receiving them.

**Apps are Not for Children under 16**. All Apps, Services and Pinger websites are not intended for children under the age of 16, so children under the age of 16 should not use them at any time. If you are under 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms. Licensor does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 16. In the event that Licensor learns that it has inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 16, Licensor will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such information.

**Applicability**. These terms incorporate by reference the terms made available by the particular app store from which you downloaded the App (“App Store”) applicable to apps downloaded from that App Store, if any (“App Store Terms”). These terms also incorporate by reference the Privacy Policy. These terms control in the event of any conflict with the Privacy Policy or the App Store Terms. Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider each, respectively, reserve the right to change, modify or update these terms and the License, the Inbound Terms and the Outbound Terms embodied herein, at any time by posting revised versions at [https://pinger.staging.wpengine.com](https://pinger.staging.wpengine.com/) (“Pinger Site”) and you agree that posting of such updates constitutes sufficient notice to you regarding such updates. Your download of other Apps or your continued use of Apps and Services following posting of updates on the Pinger Site constitutes your acceptance of the same.

**Construction**. Some Apps and Services have unique features and, as a consequence, these terms create three separate contracts: (i) a license between you and Licensor (the “License”) for your use of the Apps and communication features only available between App users (“On-Net Features”), (ii) where the App provides temporary use of a unique phone number, a separate agreement between you and the party identified as the “Inbound Provider” below, for the use of the Inbound Services described below (the “Inbound Terms”), and (iii) where the App allows for outbound SMS and/or calling features, a separate agreement between you and the party identified as the “Outbound Provider” below, for the use of the Outbound Service described below (the “Outbound Terms”). The term “SMS” as used in this document means a message of text only or text and graphics, photos, audio clips, or video clips as enabled by the applicable App. Depending on your App, it may not include functionality for including graphics, photos, audio clips, or video clips as part of messages.

**You are the Maker and Initiator of Calls and Messages**. Licensor, Outbound Provider and Inbound Provider (both defined below) enable only the transmission of calls and messages through Apps and Services.  They do not initiate or make calls or messages, and do not have any authority to do make or initiate calls or messages, whether express or implied, except through any auto reply features that you’ve enabled through the App.  You, as a subscriber, are the maker and initiator of the calls and messages sent by you through the Apps and Services, including auto replies that you enable through the App, and you are solely responsible for all of those calls and messages.

**Account Registration**. Use of most Apps requires that you create an account (the “Account”). When setting up an Account: (i) you may be prompted to provide a phone number to receive a call or SMS from us so that we may authenticate your Account registration and you acknowledge and agree that we may place, and that your provider may charge you for, that incoming call or SMS; and (ii) you are prompted for registration information, which may include your country of residence, name, age, email address, and account password, and a phone number. You hereby consent and to allow, and represent that you have the right to allow, Licensor to: (i) import and store your device name and contacts from your device, and from third party services through connections enabled by you through the Apps, (ii) identify you by the name and phone number provided during registration to third parties with whom you communicate using the Apps, (iii) identify your association with those contacts to other users of Apps, (iv) identify phone numbers in your contact list to individuals or entities associated with those phone numbers, and (v) to associate contact information on your device with contact information from third party services enabled by you through the Apps.. Accounts are for your personal use and may not be transferred or assigned by you to a third party. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO MAKE YOUR CONTACTS AVAILABLE TO THE APP, YOU CANNOT REGISTER AN ACCOUNT AND YOUR USE OF THE APPS WILL BE LIMITED.

**Third Party Features; Open Source Software**. There may be times when App features are offered by third parties who provide those features under their own terms and conditions not included in these terms. Those separate terms and conditions would govern your use of such features. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider shall not have any liability to you for your use of, or your inability to use, those features, regardless of any act or failure to act by any of them; and (ii) as an express condition for making those services available through the App, you shall not to bring any action against Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider, or any of their officers, directors, employees, or shareholders arising out of or related to those features. The App is provided with open source software, identified at the end of these terms, which is licensed under terms and conditions of its licensors. The provisions of these terms up to and including this paragraph are referred to as the “Base Terms.”

#### **License**

This License governs your use of the software elements of the Apps and On-Net Features (described below) and applies to updates of the App made available to you. Your use of the Inbound Service or Outbound Service is governed separately under the Inbound Terms or Outbound Terms, respectively.

**License**. Subject to the terms of this License, unless you are a resident of the European Union, Licensor grants to you a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (i) use the App for your personal use only and only on the device on to which it is downloaded; and (ii) use communications features to communicate with other App users over networks not connected to public telephone services (“On-Net Features”). If you are a resident of the European Union, no rights are granted to you and you may not use the App or the Service. You agree that you shall not make or permit the making of any modifications, additions or enhancements to Apps, or cause or permit the disassembly, decompilation or reverse engineering of any App except and only to the extent allowed by applicable law.

**Requirements**. For Account creation, only a single number may be used for authentication and you acknowledge that use of the same number for a future authentication may terminate your account and that Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider will not have any liability to you in such event. As an express condition to your use of the App, you agree to provide Licensor proper identification and residence information when requested. If your version of App includes voicemail, photo or audio or video recording features, you consent to allow, and represent that you have the right to allow, Licensor to copy, cache, store, distribute and share voicemails, photos and/or audio and video recordings as you designate through the App. For voicemail features, you agree that voicemails may be subject to limitations as to the number and duration of voicemails. You agree and hereby grant Licensor the right to copy, cache and store voicemails and/or message content, with that right to survive expiration or termination of this License. You agree that you will only use the Apps and Services on the devices authorized by you and on which the Apps are designed to operate; that you will not share the App with others using a single App Store account; and that you will not use or allow the use of the Apps and/or Services in conjunction with any other device, system or server to enable multiple users of a single account, including but not limited to any private branch or key system. You agree that you will not use the Apps or Services in violation of applicable law (e.g. no texting while driving) or to: (i) collect information about App users or message or call recipients without their advance and express consent; (ii) resell or allow third parties to use the Apps and Services, or use the Apps or Services in a for a fraudulent or deceptive purpose, or in manner that violates applicable law; (iii) use the Apps and/or Services in excess of what Licensor determines, in its sole discretion, would be expected of normal use as described above; (iv) create or transmit any content or communications using the Apps or Services that are obscene, abusive, harassing, threatening, racist, malicious, fraudulent, defamatory, libelous, harmful to minors or that may violate or infringe the rights or privacy of third parties, as determined by Licensor in its sole discretion; (v) send spam or advertisements in violation of applicable law or without the advance consent of the recipient; (vi) engage in bulk messaging, robocalling, auto-dialing, ID spoofing, or similar deceptive practice, including but not limited to using Apps in a deceptive manner to harass, intimidate, trick or deceive another, making multiple changes of your App phone number after having a phone number blocked, or sending any messages to recipients without having obtained legally required consents from those recipients ; or (vii) engage in high-risk financial services (such as payday loans; short term high-interest loans; auto, mortgage or student loans; debt collection, gambling/sweepstakes; stock alerts; or cryptocurrency), risk investments or multi-level marketing, third party job postings, debt forgiveness or credit repair programs, controlled substances, phishing, pornography, deceptive marketing, lead generation or referral campaigns (the conduct in this subsections (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) above are referred to as “Spam Attacking”).

**_YOU AGREE THAT IF YOU ARE SPAM ATTACKING, SUCH CONDUCT MAY CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO LICENSOR AND, AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY OF ASCERTAINING THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGE, YOU AGREE TO PAY LICENSOR U.S.$500.00 PER CALL OR SMS MESSAGE THAT CONSTITUTES SPAM ATTACKING (AS DEFINED ABOVE) AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT A PENALTY AND CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS THAT LICENSOR MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF SPAM ATTACKING._** 

**_SPECIFICALLY, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SPAM ATTACKING COULD, AMONG OTHER RISKS TO LICENSOR: (I) RESULT IN SUSPENSIONS OF SERVICE BY LICENSOR’S HOSTING, BACKEND AND/OR TRANSMISSION PROVIDERS WHICH, IF SUCH SUSPENSIONS OCCURRED, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM LICENSOR’S BUSINESS, THE DAMAGES FOR WHICH WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN, OR (II) SUBJECT LICENSOR TO LEGAL CLAIMS THAT, EVEN IF FRIVOLOUS OR DEFENSIBLE, WOULD BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING TO DEFEND AND COULD EXPOSE LICENSOR TO DAMAGES CLAIMS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES NOTED ABOVE, WITH RESULTING COSTS, RISKS AND DAMAGES OF SUCH LITIGATION ALSO DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.  ACCORDINGLY, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THE FOREGOING, AND THAT LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR SPAM ATTACKING AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONATE TO THE POTENTIAL HARM TO LICENSOR FOR SUCH CONDUCT_**.

**Data**. Prior to Account creation, Licensor may collect through the App device identifiers but no other personally identifiable information. Such information is used for the sole purpose of providing support for the internal operations of Licensor. During and after Account creation, Licensor collects data that you provide upon registration, the name and phone number of contacts as stored on your device (“Contact Data”), and data about your use of the App, which includes Personal Data and Anonymous Data. “Personal Data” is data that identifies you personally that includes: name, address, and email address, and location data of a specific location that is identified to you. Personal Data is used only to identify you with your Account in order to provide the Inbound Service and, for location data, to provide advertising to you, and to otherwise contact as set forth above. “Anonymous Data” includes the following: age, gender, phone number issued by Licensor or used with the App, message usage statistics, approximate location data (not of a specific, exact location), location data of an exact location that is anonymized so that it cannot be associated with you, message traffic data (e.g. date and time sent and received), device type and operating system, carrier identity, and device identifiers, Ethernet MAC address and/or advertising identifier, such as IDFA and Google Ad ID. To the extent any Anonymous Data constitutes a type of personal information under applicable law, our use of such information is managed as directed by such laws, as further set forth in our [Privacy Policy and Privacy Notice](https://www.pinger.com/privacy-policy/). Contact Data is stored on your device and on Licensor’s servers to enable communications features within the App. Contact Data is not used for any other purpose. Subject to your rights to have your Personal Data deleted, you hereby (i) grant Licensor perpetual licenses to store Personal Data and Contact Data and to use, copy and transmit Personal Data and Contact Data in conjunction with your use of the App; and (ii) consent to allow Licensor to transmit Personal Data and Contact Data to Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider upon registration, in response to legal process and/or to legal authorities upon request or as required under applicable law, and to mobile operators or other third parties upon your actions when you respond to certain promotional programs with them and that such transmission is made by your request and at your direction. If the App allows you to utilize features enabled by Google through Google APIs, Google requires that you also agree to comply with applicable law, regulation and Google’s Google APIs Terms of Service found here: [https://console.cloud.google.com/tos?id=universal](https://console.cloud.google.com/tos?id=universal), as may be amended by Google from time to time. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are solely responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Google APIs Terms of Service Licensor for any changes; and (ii) Inbound Provider and Outbound provider will not have any liability to you related to the use or operation of Google APIs.

**Ownership**. Licensor and its providers retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights embodied in the App.

**Additional Terms**. The Base Terms above and the Additional Terms below are incorporated into this License by reference.

#### **Inbound Terms:**

These Inbound Terms govern your use of the inbound SMS and voice features and related phone number, if made available to you (the “Inbound Service”). For U.S. phone numbers, the “Inbound Provider” is Pinger, Inc. and for Canada phone numbers it is Dinopilot. Your use of Apps is governed separately under the License. Your use of the Outbound Service is governed separately under the Outbound Terms. These Inbound Terms incorporate by reference the Privacy Policy. These Inbound Terms control in the event of any conflict with the Privacy Policy.

**License**. Subject to these Inbound Terms, Inbound Provider grants to you a license to use the phone number made available to you for inbound SMS messaging and inbound voice communication, if such features are enabled through the App, in each case solely in conjunction with the App.

**Requirements**. An Internet connection is required to use the Inbound Service for most Apps.

Licensor may also make available account features which allow the use of multiple phone numbers by multiple individuals under one master account (“Sideline Enterprise”). The following provisions apply to such paid versions of Sideline and Sideline Enterprise (collectively, “Paid Accounts”).

a. Subscription Period: The subscription period for Paid Accounts shall be as stated when you elect to establish the Paid Account (“Subscription Period”). The Subscription Period shall automatically renew for additional Subscription Periods of equal duration until you cancel your Paid Account or Licensor terminates your Paid Account.

b. Account Setup: Sideline Accounts are established by the individual Sideline Account holder. Sideline Enterprise Accounts are set up by a group administrator (the “Admin”) who registers as the Admin, selects the quantity of phone numbers, and pays for the Subscription Fees. Licensor may limit, in its sole discretion, the number of Sideline Accounts that a single person or subscriber may establish or use, whether by preventing Account setup, by canceling Accounts, or otherwise. The Admin identifies members of the group by providing the name for each group member (each a “Group Member”) and other optional information for each Group Member. Each Group Member can then set up his/or her Sideline subaccount (each a “Group Member Account”) by following the account setup process for Group Members.

c. Subscription Fees. Paid Accounts are subject to fees based upon the account type and number of phone numbers allocated to your Paid Account (“Subscription Fees”). You agree to pay all applicable Subscription Fees. Depending on how you obtained your Paid Account, the applicable App Store or Licensor will charge your credit card the Subscription Fees for the type of account and number of phone numbers you’ve chosen, plus applicable taxes. Where you obtain a Paid Account from Licensor, Licensor or its billing processors collect billing information upon registration for a Paid Account and, as with other registration information, billing information is protected the Privacy Policy. YOU WILL BE CHARGED SUBSCRIPTION FEES PLUS APPLICABLE TAXES UNTIL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELED, OR, IF PURCHASED THROUGH AN APP STORE, YOU CANCEL THE RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH MECHANISMS MADE AVAILABLE BY THE APPLICABLE APP STORE, OR LICENSOR CANCELS YOUR PAID ACCOUNT. IF A FREE TRIAL IS OFFERED FOR THE APPLICABLE APP, YOU MUST CANCEL THAT SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL. For renewals, Licensor will automatically charge your credit card the amount of the then-current fee for your type of account and phone numbers used through your Paid Account, plus applicable taxes. Licensor reserves the right to charge value-added taxes, sales, or other taxes on the Paid Accounts as it deems appropriate, and reserves the right to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of Paid Accounts at any time (a) upon notice as allowed by applicable law, and, (b) if allowed by application law, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to you, either by (i) posting pricing plan changes on the Licensor website, or (ii) sending information regarding the pricing plan changes to the email address you provided Licensor. You are responsible for regularly reviewing such pricing information.

To cancel your Sideline Enterprise subscriptions, you must send a cancelation notice via email to [cancel@sideline.com](mailto:cancel@sideline.com).

IN ORDER TO COMPLETELY TERMINATE SIDELINE ACCOUNTS, FOR BOTH INACTIVE AND ACTIVE ACCOUNTS, YOU MUST SEND A CANCELATION NOTICE VIA EMAIL TO [CANCEL@SIDELINE.COM](mailto:cancel@sideline.com) STATING THAT YOU ARE TERMINATING YOUR USE OF SIDELINE COMPLETELY.

4\. Porting: Porting is enabled for Sideline only. By setting up a Sideline account, you are making a specific request to Licensor to establish a unique, confidential code to enable the porting process to port Inbound Provider’s number associated with your account, with the code only released to you upon a porting request initiated by you. Porting requests may be commenced through the App and, for Sideline Enterprise, through the Sideline Enterprise web management console and only by the Admin. For porting in of phone numbers you will be required to provide specific information in order for Licensor to submit the porting request to your carrier. For porting out of phone numbers, you may request a port-out PIN code through the App or, for Sideline Enterprise, through the Sideline Enterprise web management console, and then contact the carrier to which porting is to be made. Porting out requires that the number is for a Paid Account, with at least a Subscription Period of one month, or that the number you are porting out is a number that you previously ported into Sideline, and that you have not previously ported out a number for the Sideline Account or the applicable Group Member of a Sideline Enterprise Account. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) porting in or out may each be subject to an additional fee as allowed by applicable law and that you shall be required to pay such fees as required by Licensor; (ii) phone numbers belong to the Inbound Provider and are available for porting as a feature of a Paid Account; and (iii) porting is coordinated through Licensor’s local exchange carrier (the “CLEC”), so actual porting is not conducted by Licensor. Porting of phone numbers is subject to involvement, cooperation and consent of third parties, including the CLEC and the carriers from whom or to whom porting is requested. Consequently, porting processes may take considerable time and may not be feasible or allowed, or may be blocked or withheld by third parties and that Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider shall not have any liability to you for any actions or failures to act by such parties. AS CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE SIDELINE APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT: (I) ANY PORTED OUT PHONE NUMBERS SHALL BE FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE AND WILL NOT BE RESOLD OR SUBLICENSED; (II) ONLY ADMINS MAY PORT OUT NUMBERS FOR SIDELINE ENTERPRISE ACCOUNTS; AND (III) INBOUND PROVIDER, OUTBOUND PROVIDER, AND LICENSOR SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR THE INABILITY TO EITHER PORT IN OR PORT OUT A PHONE NUMBER, FOR ANY DELAY OR ERRORS IN FULFILLING A PORTING REQUEST, FOR ANY PHONE NUMBER SUBSTITUTION, OR FOR ANY LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE ARISING OUT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

#### **Wireless Services Charges**

You are solely responsible for any fees and costs associated with any wireless voice or data services utilized by the App. Check the terms of your agreement with your carrier to determine if your carrier restricts or imposes fees or charges for VoIP transmissions or terms that would otherwise prohibit your use of the App.

Further, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) your cellular connection may be used for voice functionality of the Inbound Service (as defined in the Master Terms) and that you are solely responsible for cellular usage charges which you incur from use of the Inbound Service; and (ii) your cellular connection may be used for the voice functionality of Outbound Service and that you are solely responsible for cellular usage charges which you incur from use of the Outbound Service.

#### **Phone Numbers**

You acknowledge and agree that Licensor or Inbound Provider owns the phone numbers issued to you from the App and that you do not have any rights to transfer the phone number or to use the phone number separate and apart from the App. Inbound Provider, as holder of that phone number as registered with the applicable competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”), may reclaim the phone number associated with your account at any time and/or discontinue phone number availability at any time, in each case without liability to you, provided that Inbound Provider will not reclaim the phone number used with Index unless you fail to make payments as required or otherwise violate these terms and conditions, or where reclamation is required by the CLEC or applicable law.

You agree that you shall not: (i) share your use of the phone number associated with your use of Index with a third party through any means, (ii) resell any phone number or subscriptions for any App or Service, (iii) use the App or Service for call center operations, for calling phone numbers to generate income for you or a third party, for programmatic calling, or for unsolicited marketing or faxing or consumer research communications.

#### **Index Features**

1\. Voicemail transcriptions: Your version of Index may include voicemail transcription capabilities. If so, by using Index, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Licensor may transcribe or have transcribed by a third party, and store and have stored by a third party, voicemail messages, and to make transcriptions available to you, and that you hereby provide your express consent to the foregoing per the requirements of 18 U.S.C. §2702(b); (ii) Licensor, its affiliates, its service providers, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns shall not have any liability to you for any transcription errors; (iii) you may not use or copy such features, or any source code or documentation for the same; (iv) you shall not, and shall not allow or enable a third party to, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of those features; and (iii) you shall not, and shall not allow or enable a third party to, disclose or publish any benchmark or performance data regarding international calling features to any third party.

2\. International calling: Your version of Index may include international calling features. If so, by using Index, you acknowledge and agree that international calling is enabled through connections between Licensor and third party providers, and that Licensor, its affiliates, its service providers, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns shall not have any liability to you for any errors, delays, interruptions or failure of international calling features. You acknowledge and agree that international calls are subject to call time and geographic limitations and may be further limited and/or restricted by Licensor and/or Outbound Provider in its or their sole discretion at any time and without notice or liability to you.

3\. Index with paid features: From time to time Licensor may make available paid versions or paid features of the Index App which include tools that allow you to manage native features of your phone with one of Inbound Provider’s phone numbers dedicated to your account and not subject to reclamation except as provided in the Inbound Terms (“Paid Accounts”). Those features are not otherwise available in free versions of Licensor applications.

a. Subscription Period. The subscription period for Paid Accounts shall be as stated when you elect to establish the Paid Account (“Subscription Period”). The Subscription Period shall automatically renew for additional Subscription Periods of equal duration until you cancel your Paid Account or Licensor terminates your Paid Account.

b. Account Setup. Index Accounts are established by the individual Index Account holder. Licensor may limit, in its sole discretion, the number of Index Accounts that a single person or subscriber may establish or use, whether by preventing Account setup, by canceling Accounts, or otherwise. The Licensor identifies members of the group by providing the name for each group member (each a “Group Member”) and other optional information for each Group Member. Each Group Member can then set up his/or her Index subaccount (each a “Group Member Account”) by following the account setup process for Group Members.

c. Subscription Fees. Paid Accounts are subject to fees based upon the account type and number of phone numbers allocated to your Paid Account (“Subscription Fees”). You agree to pay all applicable Subscription Fees. Depending on how you obtained your Paid Account, the applicable App Store or Licensor will charge your credit card the Subscription Fees for the type of account and number of phone numbers you’ve chosen, plus applicable taxes. Where you obtain a Paid Account from Licensor, Licensor or its billing processors collect billing information upon registration for a Paid Account and, as with other registration information, billing information is protected by the Privacy Policy. YOU WILL BE CHARGED SUBSCRIPTION FEES PLUS APPLICABLE TAXES UNTIL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELED, OR, IF PURCHASED THROUGH AN APP STORE, YOU CANCEL THE RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH MECHANISMS MADE AVAILABLE BY THE APPLICABLE APP STORE, OR LICENSOR CANCELS YOUR PAID ACCOUNT. IF A FREE TRIAL IS OFFERED FOR THE APPLICABLE APP, YOU MUST CANCEL THAT SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL. For renewals, Licensor will automatically charge your credit card the amount of the then-current fee for your type of account and phone numbers used through your Paid Account, plus applicable taxes. Licensor reserves the right to charge value-added taxes, sales, or other taxes on the Paid Accounts as it deems appropriate, and reserves the right to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of Paid Accounts at any time (a) upon notice as allowed by applicable law, and, (b) if allowed by application law, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to you, either by (i) posting pricing plan changes on the Licensor website, or (ii) sending information regarding the pricing plan changes to the email address you provided Licensor. You are responsible for regularly reviewing such pricing information. Continued use of Paid Accounts or non-termination of your Paid Account after such notice constitutes your acceptance of the prices as modified. All payments are non-refundable. To the extent that payment mechanisms are provided through third parties, you agree that Licensor shall have no liability to you arising out of the acts or omissions of such third parties. BY CREATING A PAID ACCOUNT YOU CONSENT TO ALLOW LICENSOR, OR THE APPLICABLE APP STORE, TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ITS PAYMENT PROCESSORS, FOR THE AMOUNTS DUE FOR YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND FOR ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS UNTIL YOUR ACCOUNT IS CANCELED OR TERMINATED. IF YOU PURCHASE AN INDEX SUBSCRIPTION DIRECTLY FROM LICENSOR (IF AND WHEN MADE AVAILABLE BY LICENSOR) UNLESS YOU NOTIFY LICENSOR OF ANY DISCREPANCIES WITH RESPECT TO PAID ACCOUNT BILLING WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THEY FIRST APPEAR ON YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT, YOU AGREE THAT THEY WILL BE DEEMED ACCEPTED BY YOU FOR ALL PURPOSES. IF LICENSOR DOES NOT RECEIVE PAYMENT FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD ISSUER OR ITS AGENT, YOU AGREE TO PAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE UPON DEMAND BY LICENSOR OR ITS AGENTS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY GOVERNMENTAL TAXES IMPOSED ON YOUR PURCHASES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SALES, USE OR VALUE-ADDED TAXES.

d. Reviews. Your version of Index may include review request capabilities to solicit customer reviews from your customers on 3rd party services. If so, by using Index, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are the owner of the business for which you are soliciting customer reviews, (ii) you will not engage in deceiving practices to request reviews, (iii) you have the data privacy consent of the customer to solicit their review, and (iv) Pinger is not responsible for the reviews provided by your customers.

e. Appointments. Pinger will enable businesses to share their availability with their customers and to allow their customers to book appointments directly on their calendar. Pinger will also send appointment confirmations and reminders via email.

f. Payments. Your version of Index may include payment request capabilities to solicit payments from your customers via 3rd party payment providers. If so, by using Index, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you will only use Index to solicit payments for services that you have directly provided to your customers, (ii) any payment disputes with your customer shall be your responsibility to resolve and (iii) Pinger is not responsible for any payment collection or disputes.

g. Cancelation. To cancel your Index subscription, you must cancel the recurring subscription through mechanisms made available by the applicable App Store provider. For subscriptions purchased through the Apple App Store, in the “Settings” feature, tap “App and iTunes Stores,” tap your Apple ID (you may need to sign in), under “Subscriptions” tap “Manage,” tap the subscription you want to manage, and use the options to manage your subscriptions. See [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) for detailed instructions on canceling your subscription. For subscriptions purchased through Google Play, go to payments.google.com, select “Bills and Accounts,” and select the subscription you want to cancel. See [https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2476088?hl=en](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2476088?hl=en) for details on canceling your subscription.

IF YOU DEACTIVATE YOUR INDEX ACCOUNT USING THE MECHANISMS AVAILABLE IN THE INDEX APP, THE ACCOUNT BECOMES “INACTIVE” BUT IS NOT TERMINATED. ONCE YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED, YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE DELETED.

AND IN ORDER TO TERMINATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MUST CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE APPLICABLE APP STORE AS PROVIDED ABOVE.

4\. Porting: Porting is enabled for Index only. By setting up an Index account, you are making a specific request to Licensor to establish a unique, confidential code to enable the porting process to port Inbound Provider’s number associated with your account, with the code only released to you upon a porting request initiated by you. Porting requests may be commenced through the App. For porting in of phone numbers you will be required to provide specific information in order for Licensor to submit the porting request to your carrier. For porting out of phone numbers, you may request a port-out PIN code through the App and then contact the carrier to which porting is to be made. Porting out requires that the number is for a Paid Account, with at least a Subscription Period of one month, or that the number you are porting out is a number that you previously ported into Index, and that you have not previously ported out a number for the Index Account. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) porting in or out may each be subject to an additional fee as allowed by applicable law and that you shall be required to pay such fees as required by Licensor; (ii) phone numbers belong to the Inbound Provider and are available for porting as a feature of a Paid Account; and (iii) porting is coordinated through Licensor’s local exchange carrier (the “CLEC”), so actual porting is not conducted by Licensor. Porting of phone numbers is subject to involvement, cooperation and consent of third parties, including the CLEC and the carriers from whom or to whom porting is requested. Consequently, porting processes may take considerable time and may not be feasible or allowed, or may be blocked or withheld by third parties and that Licensor, Inbound Provider and Outbound Provider shall not have any liability to you for any actions or failures to act by such parties. AS CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE INDEX APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT: (I) ANY PORTED OUT PHONE NUMBERS SHALL BE FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE AND WILL NOT BE RESOLD OR SUBLICENSED; AND (II) INBOUND PROVIDER, OUTBOUND PROVIDER, AND LICENSOR SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR THE INABILITY TO EITHER PORT IN OR PORT OUT A PHONE NUMBER, FOR ANY DELAY OR ERRORS IN FULFILLING A PORTING REQUEST, FOR ANY PHONE NUMBER SUBSTITUTION, OR FOR ANY LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE ARISING OUT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING. IN ADDITION, YOU MAY ONLY PORT OUT A NUMBER IF THE ACCOUNT IS ACTIVE AND THE PHONE NUMBER IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.

5\. Business Messaging Features: If you utilize any business messaging features for Index, you agree to the following additional terms:
