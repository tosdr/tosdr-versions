TA is focused on doing the right things, at the right time and for the right reasons. We don’t only seek to be compliant with all governmental regulations TA wants to be an industry leader. To this end, we have developed our comprehensive Income Disclosure Statement (“IDS”). It is designed to convey truthful, timely and thorough information regarding the income our affiliates can earn with TA. We are proud to display this information and so should you.

* a) A statement of average earnings
* b) A statement of non-average earnings
