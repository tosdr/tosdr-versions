• We will only transfer your personal data to third parties that have signed our own Data Processing Agreement tosafeguard and secure your personal data, or which are located in countries deemed to provide an adequate level ofprotection by the UK authorities or the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission:

Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.

• Where we use international service providers, we are invariably bound by their own Data Processing Agreements,usually in a form approved by the UK authorities or European Commission, and which give personal data the sameprotection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal

data to third countries.

• Where we use service providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shieldwhich requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the UK or European Union (EU)and the US.
