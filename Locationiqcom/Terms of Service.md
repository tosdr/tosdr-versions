Subject to your ("Licensee") full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Unwired Labs grants Licensee a non-exclusive, revocable, nonsublicensable, nontransferable license to use the LocationIQ application program interface and other materials provided by Unwired Labs (collectively, "API") to develop, reproduce, display and distribute applications, websites and/or services (collectively "Applications") that interoperate with the Service. Licensee may not use the API for any other purpose without Unwired Labs' prior written consent.

### Developer API Key

In order to access the API, you must register for a unique API key (the "Key") from Unwired Labs. You will be issued the Key for accessing the API and managing your account. You may only access the API with the Key issued to you by Unwired Labs. Access may not always be available. You may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose your Key to any other party. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your Key. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur using your Key, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by you or a third party. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date and accurate information (including a current email address and other required contact information) for your account. Unwired Labs may discontinue your access to the API if such contact information is not up-to-date and/or you do not respond to communications directed to such coordinates.

### API Modifications

Unwired Labs reserves the right to modify the Service and the API, and to release subsequent versions of the API.

Unwired Labs may limit the number of network calls that your Application may make via the API, or anything else about the API and the Responses it accesses as Unwired Labs deems appropriate, in its sole discretion. In addition, Unwired Labs may change usage limitations at any time.
