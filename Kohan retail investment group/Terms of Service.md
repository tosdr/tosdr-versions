Responsibility for User-Generated Content Posted on or Through this Site
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless otherwise specified, you may only post User-Generated Content to the Site if you are a resident of the United States and are eighteen (18) years of age or older.

This means that you, not Kohan Retail Investment Group, are entirely responsible for all User-Generated Content that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If any part of the User-Generated Content you post is not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permissions to post it.

Because we do not control the User-Generated Content posted on or through this Site, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that User-Generated Content. You also agree and understand that by accessing this Site, you may encounter User-Generated Content that you may consider to be objectionable. We have no responsibility for any User-Generated Content, including without limitation any errors or omissions therein. We are not liable for any loss or damage of any kind you claim was incurred as a result of the use of any User-Generated Content posted, e-mailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on or through this Site. The User-Generated Content posted on or through this Site expresses the personal opinions of the individuals who posted it and does not necessarily reflect the views of Kohan Retail Investment Group or any person or entity associated with Kohan Retail Investment Group.

_You own User-Generated Content, but we may use it._ You own the copyright in any original User-Generated Content you post. We do not claim any copyrights in User-Generated Content. However, by using this Site you are granting us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, a nonexclusive, fully paid, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and perform, publish, transmit, remove, retain repurpose, and commercialize User-Generated Content you post in any and all media or form of communication whether now existing or hereafter developed, without obtaining additional consent, without restriction, notification, or attribution, and without compensating you in any way, and to authorize others to do the same. For this reason, we ask that you not post any User-Generated Content that you do not wish to license to us, including any confidential information or product ideas. If, notwithstanding this policy, you submit an unsolicited idea to this Site, you understand and acknowledge that such idea is not submitted in confidence and we assume no obligation, expressed or implied, by considering it.

_We may disclose and/or remove User-Generated Content._ Kohan Retail Investment Group reserves certain rights. We reserve the right (but do not assume the obligation) to monitor all User-Generated Content. We reserve the right to require that you avoid certain subjects, if we believe that doing so will help ensure compliance with applicable laws. We reserve the right (but do not assume the obligation) to remove or block any User-Generated Content at any time without notice at our sole and absolute discretion. We reserve the right to disclose any User-Generated Content and the identity of the user who posted it in response to a subpoena or whenever we believe that disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order, to prevent or investigate a possible crime or other violation of law, to protect the rights of Kohan Retail Investment Group or others, or to enforce these Terms of Use. In addition, we reserve the right (but do not assume the obligation) to terminate your access to and use of this Site, or to censor, edit or block your transmissions thereto in our sole discretion. You agree that our exercise of such discretion shall not render us the owners of User-Generated Content you post, and that you will retain ownership thereof as described above.

_Restrictions on User-Generated Content._ It is a condition of these Terms of Use that you do not:

* upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available
    * any User-Generated Content that is unlawful, harmful, hateful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, racially disparaging, indecent, or invasive of another’s privacy;
    * any User-Generated Content that constitutes or promotes any illegal activity or promotes violence, including, without limitation, any User-Generated Content constituting or encouraging conduct that would be a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any local, state, national or foreign law;
    * any User-Generated Content that is false, misleading, or fraudulent;
    * any User-Generated Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information or proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
    * any User-Generated Content that violates or infringes upon the rights of others, including User-Generated Content which violates the patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, trade secret rights, confidentiality rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any individual, living or deceased, or any legal entity;
    * any User-Generated Content that contains the image, name or likeness of anyone other than yourself, unless (i) that person is at least eighteen years old and you have first obtained his/her express permission or (ii) that person is under  eighteen years old but you are his/her parent or legal guardian;
    * any request for or solicitation of any personal or private information from any individual;
    * any request for or solicitation of money, goods, or services for private gain;  
    * any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; or
    * any User-Generated Content that contains advertising, promotions or marketing, or which otherwise has a commercial purpose;
* impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; or

By posting User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that (i) you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the User-Generated Content and have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the User-Generated Content is accurate, and (iii) you are at least eighteen years old and you have read and understood—and your User-Generated Content fully complies with—these Terms of Use and applicable laws and will not cause injury to any person or entity.

Your Feedback
-------------

Although we do not claim ownership of User-Generated Content you post using this Site, the Feedback you provide to us through this Site will be and remain our exclusive property. Your submission of Feedback will constitute an assignment to us of all worldwide rights, title and interests in your Feedback, including all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in your Feedback.

_In general._ On certain pages of this Site, we may provide to you a tool to report objectionable User-Generated Content. If that tool is not available, you can report objectionable User-Generated Content and other objectionable Content by contacting us using the [information provided above](#ContactInfomation). While we do not have any obligation to remove Content from this Site merely because of a removal request, we will review all such requests and will remove Content that we determine should be removed, in our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms of Use and applicable law. Please be aware, however, that if the Content has already been distributed to other websites or published in other media, we will not be able to recapture and delete it. Also, a back-up or residual copy of the Content we remove from this Site may remain on back-up servers.

If you are requesting removal of content because of a violation of your copyrights, please note that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.

* an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;

* a written statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

In such a case the limitations and exclusions set out in these Terms of Use shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such applicable jurisdictions. Your statutory rights as a consumer, if any, are not affected by these provisions, and we do not seek to exclude or limit liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.
