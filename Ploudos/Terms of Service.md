Terms Of Service and Code of Conduct
====================================

**§1 Preface**

We, **PloudOS**, offer you Minecraft servers **100% for free**. That’s why there are a couple of rules **you need to respect** if you want everything to work out. If there weren’t any rules, everybody could do whatever they want and since not all humans are altruistic, there would be chaos. As said above: This is a free service and we want to give a server to as many people as possible. Therefore, **if you break the rules**, we will have to make use of our **right to terminate** your account and lock your server.

**Please also note that with the use of PloudOS automatically agree the [Minecraft EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula)!**

**§2 Plugins & Mods**

There is an ever-growing number of plugins and mods available on PloudOS which you can **install and manage easily** via the PloudOS server web interface. However, to avoid abuse we had to lay down some rules. You are not allowed to:

1. Install Plugins or Mods that require a **server port**
2. Install Plugins or Mods with **extreme** server **usage**
3. Install Plugins or Mods that in any way influence, make vulnerable to **exploit or impair the host-server** (node)
4. Install **illegal** Plugins or Mods, that are able to perform any illegal actions _(illegal in the place of residence of PloudOS –> Germany)_
5. Install any Plugins or Mods with a **malevolent** intent _(for example the intent to exploit PloudOS)_

**§3 Worlds**

We provide Plugins that allow you to create multiple worlds. Because there aren’t any limitations set by the Plugins, we have to limit the **maximum number** of allowed **worlds to 20**. Please understand that if your server has **more worlds**, it **will be terminated**.

**§4 Performance, usage and server**

We want to give users the best performance possible. Therefore, we want this server power to be used sensible. If you use your server power for pointless things or simply squander it, your server will be terminated. Here are some examples of what is considered insensible server usage:

1. Changing the gamerule RandomTickSpeed _(Changing the RandomTickSpeed is allowed to a certain extent, if the server draws too much power as a result, we will stop the server.)_
2. Keeping the server online with a Bot or other programs _(When no human is playing on the server, please stop your server. It’s not fair towards other users.)_
3. Being afk on the server for longer than 10 minutes _(Usually you get kicked after this time. Changing the idleSetTimeout is not allowed.)_
4. It is strictly forbidden to sell anything with real money on PloudOS servers. _(This ranges from blocking the user account to legal action.)_

**§5 User accounts**

There are the following rules for user accounts:

1. It is generally forbidden to create more accounts on PloudOS. _(However, it is allowed as long as the servers are not networked and are also used for a completely different purpose.)_
2. It is not allowed to sell user accounts. _(This ranges from blocking the user account to legal action.)_

**§6 Bugs and Exploits**

If you find a bug or exploit, please contact support immediately. **Bug using will not be tolerated.**

**§7 Termination of Service**

PloudOS has the right to terminate your server at any time. If you for example break the rules, your server will be terminated. You may not be able to get your server data back. Do not break the rules.

**§8 Discord Rules**

**Style**

1. Try to form whole sentences. Nobody wants to read gibberish like this: “stupid! Do else! Running lol!”
2. Message length is important. In general, the rule is at least a sentence per message. Do not unnecessarily spread out sentences over multiple messages. We certainly do not need a message per word.
3. Do not spam . There are different kinds of spam. Spam are messages that are designed to or will with high probability annoy other people in the chat room. The following will quickly explain different kinds of spam, but every kind of spam is forbidden even if it’s not listed.

“_!!!!????....,,,,”_ alias **“Punctuation marks are no pack animals.”** Please use a maximum of 3 punctuation marks in a row and do not send messages only consisting of punctuation marks. _This is the same for smileys. You can send a message just consisting of a smiley though._

“_iiiii love you!”_ alias **“Repeating characters.”** Same as for punctuation marks: Please use a maximum of 3 in a row and 2 character-repetitions per message.

“_I LOVE YOU”_ alias **“CAPS”** is the chatroom equivalent of shouting. It is extremely impolite and counts as spam if you capitalize more than one word per message. Please do not send messages only consisting of one capitalized word.

“_I am annoying. I am annoying. I am am am annoying.“_ alias **“Repetition”**. Please do not send the same message or a variant of that message multiple times in a row.

1. Understanding is key, therefore mind your abbreviations. It is okay to use IM (instant messaging) abbreviations but be prepared to explain them if the other person doesn’t understand.
2. Do not use swear words. A single “Damn!” can be fine but try to find other ways to express your ways. Overuse of swear words will get you banned.
3. Use correct spelling and grammar. Everybody makes mistakes, but make sure your messages are easy to read and understand. _(Ai tink smtms dad spaling isn um po tend)_

**Content**

1. Try to stay on topic. There are different Discord Channels for a reason. The following list of Discord Channels and their topic may not be up to date. If you can’t find a channel on the list, ask about its topic in a new support ticket or in the #public-help channel.

**#ticketsystem** This channel is used to create new support tickets on our Discord server. The ticket system is only available to registered users of PloudOS who have connected their Discord and PloudOS account. If you are new to PloudOS and do not have an account yet, please use #public-help to get support. If you meet all criteria to use the ticket system and are about to create a new ticket, please first check if your issue already fits into one of the various channels on our Discord or if it is already covered by our FAQ.

**#general** For general discussions about PloudOS and everything PloudOS related if it does not belong in any of the other channels. Please check if this is the right channel before sending your message!

**#servers** This is the only channel where you can advertise your PloudOS server. Please only advertise servers hosted on PloudOS. Only post your server advertisement once every 30 minutes. Exceeding this number of postings will result in a ban.

**#public-help** You cannot use the ticket system because you do not own a PloudOS account yet, but you still have a question or problem with PloudOS? Then this is the right place for you! Here you can ask us as well as our community for help. _Please note that answers from community members may be incorrect or incomplete! If you are not sure about the truth of a statement, please ask explicitly one of our team members._ If you are already registered on PloudOS and have connected your Discord and PloudOS account as well, please use the ticket system. If you still want to seek advice or help from our community, please note that statements made by people who are not in our team may be wrong or incomplete. _We do not check the truthfulness of user contributions, nor does dangerous half-knowledge protect you from punishment in case of breaking the rules!_ Also, please make sure that this channel is the right place for your question or problem. Moreover, please post your question only once every 10 minutes and respect the style rules. Please do not tag (tagging is addressing certain people in Discord with @NAME) any of the administrators, but a supporter (for more information see the tagging rules).

_Most importantly, please do not include commercial, religious, or political content in your message. This is because PloudOS is not_ _an advertising board and neither it is a discussion board. Statements expressing religious beliefs or political opinions have a high probability of being inflammatory to someone in the chat room and making them feel uncomfortable. Since this Discord chatroom is all about enjoying the services PloudOS offers and resolving problems with those services please only talk about PloudOS related things._

1. Remember your obligations under international copyright laws. Do not post copyrighted material such as pictures, books and music. If you are unsure whether or not a material is protected by copyright, do not post it! More information regarding copyright you can find here: [http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/intellectual-property/what-is-copyright.html](http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/intellectual-property/what-is-copyright.html)
2. Refrain from ad hominem attacks _(or in plain English attacking someone personally, "dissing" someone)_ . Disagreeing is fine, but do not get emotional or abusive. Discussions about religious beliefs or political opinions are off-topic and thus not allowed on PloudOS (as explained in Content Rules #1).
3. Do not disclose private information. If a user asks you about your full name, address, telephone number or other private details, please report that user to a Supporter. When a person claiming to be a Supporter demands information like that, please make sure they are a real Supporter listed on the PloudOS website.
4. Please refrain from posting messages with adult themes. Posting rated content will not be tolerated! PloudOS is a family friendly website.
5. Don’t respond to spam or other messages that break the rules. Instead ignore them or tag a Supporter if you think they will not see it.
6. Do not troll. (What is trolling? [https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-internet-trolling-3485891](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-internet-trolling-3485891) )
7. If you have said or done something wrong, apologize. Everybody makes mistakes sometimes. Please admit them and be serious about it. _(Writing “Sorryyy” is not an adequate or sincere apology.)_
8. The main language of PloudOS is English. Support languages are English, German, Portuguese and Spanish. Please contact Supporters only in a language they speak. _You can see what languages they speak by looking at the tag next to their name: ENG = English, DE = German, PT = Portuguese, ES = Spanish._ Of course you can speak other languages on our Discord server too, but please do not tag any of our supporters in this case.
9. Do not impersonate other people or ranks. For example, do not pretend to be Michael Jackson or a PloudOS Supporter.
10. Make sure your postings are correct. If you, for example, want to help another user in the plugins chatroom, make sure what you are saying about the plugin is true. _Do not assume posted information is always correct, check it for yourself and if you have any doubts concerning its truth do not spread it._

**Conduct**

1. Lurk before you leap! Try to read the most recent messages in the chat room and do not just disrupt the conversation. It gets annoying easily when a question is asked three times in a row or the topic switched without explanation.
2. Do not argue with Administrators or Supporters. If you think they made a mistake (they are only human), privately message them and ask about it. _In the end they have the authority and the right to enforce it. Therefore, even if you could not come to a consensus, accept their decisions. You don’t have to agree, just accept the decision._
3. If you are kicked out of the Discord, take a minute to consider what you did wrong. The next time it might be a ban.
4. Do not message Supporters privately just because you want to play with them. If you have a question, take it to a support ticket, or to the #public-help channel in case you want to approach the whole community. If it’s a really private question, you can of course send a private message.
5. Respect people’s privacy and accept that they are not online 24/7.
6. Make sure you’re in the right discord. This is the PloudOS user discord. If you hate PloudOS or do not use it, don’t waste your time here. Instead open a PloudOS Flamers Discord.
7. In general, when someone writes something that makes you mad (and someone will), resist the impulse to flame back. We do not want flame wars.

**Tagging** **Rules**

1. Only tag people once.
2. Do not tag the administrator for support.
3. Only tag Supporters that understand the language of your message. _You can see what languages they speak by looking at the tag next to their name: ENG = English, TR= Turkish, DE = German._
