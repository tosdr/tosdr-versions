EOS Worldwide Master Terms of Use
---------------------------------

© EOS Worldwide, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Welcome to EOS Worldwide! 

EOS®, the Entrepreneurial Operating System, is a complete set of simple concepts and practical tools. Rocket Fuel™ is the world’s premier learning platform for Visionaries and Integrators™ running on EOS. EOS’s and Rocket Fuel’s tools have been used by thousands of entrepreneurial companies to grow their businesses.

Today, we operate these dynamic brands as well as other businesses to help entrepreneurs, leadership teams and others get what they want from their businesses. These include EOS One™, Rocket Fuel University™, our Base Camp and our EOS Worldwide implementer community, a network of entrepreneurs from a variety of backgrounds who are passionate about teaching and living The EOS Life®. 

We are pleased to provide you with access to certain EOS Worldwide systems, programs, products, and other intellectual property, which include (i) websites (including [www.eosworldwide.com](http://www.eosworldwide.com/), and [https://organizationalcheckup.com](https://organizationalcheckup.com/)), software, platforms, subscriptions, memberships, applications (including mobile applications), tools, and content that we may provide or make available from time-to-time; (ii) email and network systems and accounts; (iii) client management platforms, wireless high-speed Internet access systems; and  (iv) e-commerce (such as our EOS Online Store) and promotions (collectively, the “EOS Web Properties”).

Our EOS Web Properties are provided on a limited access basis. This means that we may, in our sole discretion, limit access to and within the EOS Web Properties, and may only provide access to specific users. While certain EOS Web Properties are made available to the general public, others are made exclusively available to our subscribers, customers, and/or members, subject to limitations on access that we may impose from time-to-time.

Our EOS Web Properties and our products and services are intended for business users. We are a business to business provider, therefore, our EOS Web Properties and our products and services are not intended for consumer or general household type purposes.

The [General Terms of Use](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/general) provide a master set of terms and conditions which govern your access to and use of the EOS Web Properties, and therefore along with these EOS Worldwide Master Terms of Use, constitute an agreement between you and EOS Worldwide, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company and each of its EOS affiliated entities (“EOS Worldwide”, “we”, “us” or “our”).  

In addition to these EOS Worldwide Master Terms of Use and the [General Terms of Use](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/general), the EOS Web Properties, and your use of the EOS Web Properties, are also governed by the following additional terms, conditions and policies, each of which is incorporated into the [General Terms of Use](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/general) by reference (these EOS Worldwide Master Terms of Use, the [General Terms of Use](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/general) and each such additional set of terms, conditions and/or policies are collectively referred to as our “Terms and Conditions”):

* [General Terms of Use](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/general) 
* [EOS One™ End User Terms and Conditions](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/eos-one)
* [Rocket Fuel Membership Terms and Conditions](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/rocket-fuel)
* [Base Camp Membership Terms and Conditions](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/base-camp) 
* [EOS Online Store Terms and Conditions](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/store)
* [EOS Worldwide Events General Terms and Conditions](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/events)

* [EOS Worldwide IP/Branding Guidelines](https://branding.eosworldwide.com/)
* [EOS Worldwide Privacy Notice](https://www.eosworldwide.com/privacy-policy)
* [EOS Worldwide Cookie Policy](https://www.eosworldwide.com/cookie-policy)

To the extent that any such incorporated terms conflict with the [General Terms of Use](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/general), such incorporated terms will apply and control in relation to that service, software, or other EOS Web Property.  If you are also an EOS Worldwide franchisee or licensee operating an EOS implementer business or you are otherwise a party to another agreement with EOSW, you also remain bound by the terms and conditions of any such other agreement, as applicable. If there is a conflict between our Terms and Conditions and any such other agreement, that other agreement will prevail. 

EOS Worldwide provides the EOS Web Properties solely on the terms and conditions set forth in our Terms and Conditions and on the condition that you accept and comply with them. When you use our EOS Web Properties you agree to all of our Terms and Conditions. 

All rights that are not expressly granted to you in our Terms and Conditions are expressly reserved.

EOS Worldwide may refer to our brand names that are subject to common-law trademark protection without the “™”symbol, but, for the avoidance of doubt, we hereby assert our common law trademark rights uniformly in our brands throughout and where they appear whether with or without inclusion of the “™” notation.

WITHIN THE EOS WEB PROPERTIES, WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING LINK TO BETTER ASSIST US WITH MAKING THE EOS WEB PROPERTIES FULLY ACCESSIBLE: ![](https://www.eosworldwide.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/accessibility.png).  IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY TROUBLE ACCESSING OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR ANY OF OUR EOS WEB PROPERTIES, PLEASE CONTACT US TOLL FREE AT 877-367-1877 (OR +1-248-278-8220 OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES), OR VIA EMAIL AT [\[email protected\]](https://www.eosworldwide.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN TERMS THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND US RELATING TO YOUR USE OF ANY EOS WEB PROPERTY WILL BE RESOLVED. FOR EXAMPLE, SECTION 22 OF THE [GENERAL TERMS OF USE](https://www.eosworldwide.com/terms-conditions/general) CONTAINS A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION WHICH STATES THAT , SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW,  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OR OTHERWISE ON BEHALF OF OTHERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

While we offer certain products, subscriptions, memberships and other items through our EOS Web Properties, all items are intended for adults and are intended for your use only.

However, if applicable law requires that you must be older in order for us to lawfully provide the EOS Web Properties to you without parental consent (including use of your personal data) then the Legal Age is such older age. Creating an account with false information or under false pretenses is a violation of our Terms and Conditions.

INFORMATION ON THE EOS WEB PROPERTIES IS NOT PROMISED OR GUARANTEED TO BE CORRECT OR COMPLETE AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS SUCH. NOTHING PROVIDED ON THE EOS WEB PROPERTIES SHOULD BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ADVICE OF COMPETENT AND LICENSED PROFESSIONALS.    

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NO LICENSE IS GRANTED (WHETHER EXPRESSLY, BY IMPLICATION, OR OTHERWISE), AND OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ANY RIGHT, CONCERNING ANY SOFTWARE THAT YOU DID NOT ACQUIRE LAWFULLY OR THAT IS NOT A LEGITIMATE, AUTHORIZED VERSION OF EOS WORLDWIDE’S SOFTWARE.

BY USING ANY EOS WEB PROPERTY, OR BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT OR AGREE TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHEN THIS OPTION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE INCORPORATED TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OR ANY PORTION OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE ANY EOS WEB PROPERTY OR MAKE PURCHASES ON OR THROUGH ANY EOS WEB PROPERTY. OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBE THE LIMITED BASIS ON WHICH EOS WEB PROPERTIES ARE AVAILABLE AND, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, SUPERSEDE PRIOR TERMS OF USE OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS RELATED TO EOS WEB PROPERTIES. 

IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON BEHALF OF ANY OTHER PERSON, BUSINESS OR ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT TO EOS WORLDWIDE THAT YOU HAVE THE FULL RIGHT AND AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, BUSINESS OR ENTITY.  IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMMUNICATE THE INFORMATION IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE BUSINESS OR ENTITY AND ENSURE ITS UNDERSTANDING, ACCEPTANCE AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN.
