The Perfect Sleep Chair Zones of Relaxation

Two Zones of Relaxation for Classic Comfort
-------------------------------------------

  

The Perfect Sleep Chair is designed to focus relief and comfort on two of the body’s most prevalent pain and problem areas: upper body and lower limbs. With independently operating motors, each area gets the attention it needs for supportive positioning and ultimate comfort. The upper body zone can be accessed with the touch of a button, to direct relaxation and relief specifically to a tired, tense lower back, slumping shoulders or achy hips and spine. The independent movement of the backrest allows adjustable support for back and shoulders, releasing stress and strain from the upper body.

  

Restful relief for the lower body (your aching feet, calves, knees and legs) starts with the comfortable leg/footrest designed for improved circulation and moves comfort all the way up the legs. Again, the dual motors allow those in pain to mix and match their options, to arrive at the most comfortable and supportive elevation to alleviate individual muscle and joint complaints.

  

![Perfect Sleep Chair Two Zones of Relaxation](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0556/3016/8147/files/2-zone.png?v=1664291531)

  

Five Zones of Relaxation for Ultimate Enjoyment
-----------------------------------------------

  

We are now pleased to introduce a new evolution of our Perfect Sleep Chair… the ultimate 5 zone Perfect Sleep Chair. Both the traditional Perfect Sleep Chair and new Perfect Sleep Chair - Ultimate offer the specialized attention to (1) upper body and (2) lower body zones, but the _five-motor_ Perfect Sleep Chair - Ultimate covers other zones as well, to broaden and deepen the restorative functions.

  

In this chair, _all of the body’s five positioning zones_ can be individually accessed for customized comfort and treatment measures. Those areas include (3) the lumbar, with adjustable support to take pressure off the spine and give the back muscles a chance to relax and rejuvenate; (4) the head and neck, thanks to a headrest with layers of customized support that cradles and hugs, encouraging natural support of the spine; and (5) the full-body experience that comes with a full-chair tilt! Unavailable in ordinary recliners, the full-chair tilt produces a feeling of weightlessness, encourages circulation, and promotes an end-of-day release of muscle tension and joint pain.

Who Can Benefit from a Lift Chair?

Anyone with balance or mobility issues can benefit from a lift chair, but it doesn’t stop there. The Perfect Sleep Chair comes standard with features such as heat and massage — and the quality build makes it extremely comfortable for sleeping. If you struggle with insomnia, restless leg syndrome, or other problems affecting sleep, a lift chair can alleviate the frustration for both of you.

  

Many people who use our lift chairs have no trouble standing up on their own, but simply appreciate the comfort it brings them. It’s ideal for those recovering from surgery too, as well as people with chronic back pain who can’t get comfortable in a typical chair.

  

And the zero gravity position is yet another bonus. This customizable position is especially useful for people with circulation problems, but not every lift chair will let you adjust to your unique body form.

  

So who can benefit from a lift chair? It’s simple: everyone!

Frequently Asked Questions

Where is the Perfect Sleep Chair designed and made?
---------------------------------------------------

The Perfect Sleep Chair is designed at the Journey Virginia headquarters and made in one of our manufacturing partners' facilities around the world. 

Is it okay to sleep in a recliner?
----------------------------------

Yes, in fact, a power lift recliner can offer a more comfortable sleep than a standard mattress. 

  

The Perfect Sleep Chair goes beyond a standard powered recliner when it comes to features. Not only does it offer multiple reclining positions to help you find the right position for comfortable sleep, but it provides lift capability, too**—**all that in one chair!. 

Does the chair have weight or height limitations?
-------------------------------------------------

The chair is recommended for people who weigh up to 375 lbs. For those who are of a smaller stature (4'-5' in height), we offer a Petite Perfect Sleep Chair.

How wide is the Perfect Sleep Chair?
------------------------------------

The chair models on average have a seat width of 20" and a depth of 21.5", which leaves plenty of room for even larger statured adults.

What part of the chair is heated?
---------------------------------

When you have the heat functionality turned on, the back of the chair will heat up and warm your body.

Is financing available?
-----------------------

Yes! We offer a fast and easy approval financing process with Klarna.

Can I see the Perfect Sleep Chair in person before buying it?
-------------------------------------------------------------

While our US-based product specialists are happy to help answer any questions that you may have, we do not have any Journey brick-and-mortar retail locations for people to visit.   If you look at our partner provider locator on ShopJourney, you may be able to find a retail partner who carries our Perfect Sleep Chair.

Can I rent a Perfect Sleep Chair for temporary needs?
-----------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, no, you cannot. 

What is White Glove Delivery?
-----------------------------

White Glove Delivery is the method by which each Perfect Sleep Chair is delivered to you. It includes delivery to your home, unpacking of the chair, placing it in the location you've chosen and ensuring that the chair is functional. Finally, all packaging materials are removed and hauled away for you. Note: You must have a clear path and a location available for us to place the chair in.

How long does it take to receive my Perfect Sleep Chair once I place my order?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With White Glove delivery, the timing of delivery depends largely on time it takes to schedule an appointment with the customer.  We usually have chairs in stock and so they can be setup for delivery within a few days, and actual delivery can take another 3-5 days. Occasionally, some models may be on backorder for a period of time as we have a high demand for these unique chairs.   Our sales specialists or customer service agents can provide more specific information by model.

How do I adjust the Perfect Sleep Chair?
----------------------------------------

Each chair is adjustable to an many positions by using a simple remote control. You can see how [**here**](https://youtu.be/VkCmA0g65FE).

How do you clean the chair if something is spilled on it?
---------------------------------------------------------

While our chairs are made of stain-resistant fabrics, there may come a time when you need to clean it. To do so, simply mix a little soap and water and scrub the area in need of cleaning. Do not use harsh chemicals or cleaners as these could cause problems with your materials.

What is zero gravity and why do you talk about it so much?
----------------------------------------------------------

Zero gravity (also called neutral body posture) was first discovered by NASA to relieve gravity's pressure on astronauts upon shuttle launches. It is a position that evenly distributes pressure to the body. It is known to be the most optimal position for somebody who is trying to become relaxed. Not only does it relax the spine, but due to the elevation of the legs, it relieves pressure on the heart and lungs as well. Considering all the positive effects that zero gravity has on the body, we made sure that the Perfect Sleep Chair accommodated this position.

    Leather look is peeling:(
    
    I bought the perfect sleeper lift chair for my husband in 2017. We love it… but didn’t get real leather… and it flaking off and looks horrible… seat, arms, and foot rest. I bought it when they were carried by First Street. Do they make a slip cover for it? I imagine having it recovered would be pretty costly:(. Any ideas? Patti P

    Great Product, BUT . . .
    
    I have had my Perfect Sleep Chair since the summer of 2019. It is truly perfect for sleeping. The only issue is with the controller. It worked fine until six months ago when it went on the fritz and wouldn't work at all.
    
    My engineer son said it is poorly designed and was able to fix it for me. Then, I woke up this morning and the leg support would not go down. I am disabled and had a great deal of trouble getting out of the chair. My son was again able to repair the controller, but said it is on its last legs and probably won't be repairable if it goes out again.
    
    I've lost my paperwork and hope someone sees this review and can help me get a new controller. I literally can't sleep without this chair!

    Little did I Know!
    
    I purchased a sleep chair for my mother when she moved in with us and it was wonderful . Mom lived to be 100 before she died. The chair helped me care for her. That was over 6 years ago. The heater no longer works and hopefully I can get a new one, but on Christmas Day I fell and had very serious injuries breaking my right knee cap. It took eleven days before I had surgery and then I was discharged the day of surgery to come home to a house not euipped to care for me. The chair has been amazing asset. As an APRN, I appreciate that I can get up on my own without needing assistance. Nobody even asked me about my ability to ambulate on my own. Everyone could benefit from a chair like this, I am getting a good night sleep and would encourage others my age to invest in one before you need it. It was a life safer and helped me to keep my independence. Thank you.

    I had a major back surgery and this chair has saved me from a lot of pain throughout my recovery. Only complaint is it came with a missing cord to plug into the massager remote. I did get a call to see how I liked the chair etc. told her about cord. Very kind and said they would mail it to me. Weeks have passed still no cord. Hopefully soon but I do highly recommend the chair
