14\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
-----------------------

1. APPLICABILITY. This binding individual arbitration section will not apply to the extent prohibited by the laws of your country of residence. In the United States, this Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. You understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and we agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration under the provisions in this Section 14. A “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and us that in any way relates to or arises from any aspect of our relationship, including, without limitation, your use or attempted use of the Services, the Game, and all marketing related to them, your Account(s), any licensed content, and all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, or any other agreement between you and us, including the validity and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate. A Dispute shall be subject to binding, individual arbitration regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory. This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement.
2. INFORMAL NEGOTIATION PERIOD. Our customer support panel is available at [https://support.pokemmo.com/](https://support.pokemmo.com/) to address any concerns you may have regarding the Services, your Account(s), or the Game. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our Users' satisfaction. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between us, you and The Company agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least sixty (60) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding (the “Initial Dispute Resolution Period”). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute. If we have a Dispute with you, it will send notice of that Dispute to your email address you have provided to us. If you have a Dispute with us, you must notify us in writing at the following email address: [\[email protected\]](https://pokemmo.eu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), using the subject line “Initial Dispute Resolution Notice.” Your notice of Dispute must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your full name, the email address associated with your Account(s), and your residential address. The notice of Dispute also must describe the Dispute, explain the facts of the Dispute as you understand them, and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the problem. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of Dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 60 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. A notice of Dispute will not be valid, will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or us later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of Dispute, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period. You and we authorize the arbitration provider or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period requirement, relying solely on this Agreement and the notice of Dispute (if any) that you or The Company provided before commencing arbitration.
3. BINDING ARBITRATION. If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations during the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, then either you or The Company may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, unless an exception applies as stated below. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) effective as of the date of the Notice of Dispute, which are available at the JAMS website, [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration), as modified by this Agreement. If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, then except as otherwise stated below, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Rules. Arbitration hearings may be conducted by videoconference unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary. In such instances, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in New Castle County, Delaware, and you and The Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New Castle County, Delaware, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and The Company, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of validity, enforceability or arbitrability, including, but not limited to, where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement or that any portion of this agreement is not enforceable. If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and The Company agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief shall be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.
4. EXCEPTIONS TO INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS AND ARBITRATION. Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, piracy, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation. This exclusion does not include claims related to the license granted to you for the Services under this Agreement. Excluded claims are subject to the jurisdiction and applicable law provisions in Section 14(e) below. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed, either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case.
5. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. The Agreement will be exclusively governed by Delaware law, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree that any legal suit, cause of action or proceeding that may arise out of, or related to the Agreement that is not resolved by binding arbitration as provided in Section 14(c) shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Delaware. We retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of this Agreement in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts. Claims excluded from arbitration are subject to the choice of law and forum selection clauses set forth in this Agreement.
6. 30 DAY RIGHT TO OPT OUT. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration agreement provisions by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address: [\[email protected\]](https://pokemmo.eu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), using the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out.” The notice must be sent within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Services and enter into this Agreement, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 14. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.

15\. LANGUAGE
