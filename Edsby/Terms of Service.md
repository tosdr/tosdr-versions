Usage Policy
============

* [Home](https://www.edsby.com/ "Home")

* **Usage Policy**

**Date of last revision of this policy: September 28, 2021**
============================================================

Welcome to Edsby! Edsby provides a suite of software services (the “Services”) to teachers, students, parents and administrators of a specific Education Organization. The Services are owned and operated by **CoreFour Inc.** (the “Company”)**.**

This document contains our Usage Policy governing your access to and use of the Edsby Services. We suggest you read these terms carefully before using the Services.

If you do not accept this Usage Policy, you may not use the Services. If you use our Services you agree to this Usage Policy.

Respecting and protecting the privacy of information stored within the Edsby Service is very important to us. Please consult our Services Privacy Policy at [**edsby.com/privacy-policy/**](https://www.edsby.com/privacy-policy/) for details on how we do that.

1\. Overview
------------

Edsby is a cloud-based software service that modernizes how teachers, students and parents engage with each other. Edsby is often selected through a formal competitive procurement process and rigorous evaluation of many factors including privacy and security of student data. Edsby Services are managed by Education Organizations as one part of a suite of technology solutions that every Education Organization requires.

Education Organizations pay to use Edsby and own and manage the information stored and collected by Edsby on their behalf.

User accounts for a specific Education Organization using Edsby are created by or under the direction/invitation of the administrative staff of that Education Organization. Parents/guardians and students are not allowed to create their own accounts on Edsby; they are only allowed to use authorized accounts set up specifically for them at the direction of the Education Organization they are members of.

You are permitted to access a specific customer’s Edsby Services only if you have been directly invited and authorized to do so by the administrative staff within that Education Organization.

2\. Changes To This Usage Policy
--------------------------------

The Company may make changes to this Usage Policy from time to time. We suggest you check this Usage Policy periodically for changes. By your continuing use of the Services after changes are posted, you will be deemed to have accepted such changes. Previous versions of our Usage Policy, previously described as Terms of Use, are available on our website for review.

3\. Scope of Use
----------------

You are only authorised to view, use, copy for your records and download small portions of the Content (including without limitation text, graphics, software, audio and video files and photos) from the Services for your informational, non-commercial use, provided that you leave all the copyright notices, including copyright management information or other proprietary notices intact.

You may not store, modify, reproduce, transmit, reverse engineer or distribute a significant portion of Services Content, or the design or layout of Services in any form or media. The systematic retrieval of data from the Services is also prohibited.

You agree not to submit or transmit any content, files, videos, photos, web links or other materials to the Services that: (i) are defamatory, threatening, obscene or harassing, (ii) contain a virus, worm, Trojan horse or any other harmful component, (iii) incorporate copyrighted or other proprietary material of any third party without that party’s permission or (iv) otherwise violate any applicable laws. The Company shall not be subject to any obligations of confidentiality regarding any information or materials that you submit online except as specified in this Usage Policy, or as set forth in any additional terms and conditions relating to specific products or services, or as otherwise specifically agreed or required by law.

4\. Copyrights and Trademarks
-----------------------------

The materials on these Services, as well as their organisation and layout, are copyrighted and are protected by international copyright laws and treaty provisions. You may access, download and print materials in these Services solely for your personal and non-commercial use. No right, title or interest in any of the materials contained in these Services is transferred to you as a result of accessing, downloading or printing such materials. You may not copy, modify, distribute, transmit, display, reproduce, publish, license any part of these Services; create derivative works from use on any other website, transfer or sell any information obtained from these Services without the prior written permission of the Company.

5\. Links
---------

For your convenience, we may provide links to various other websites that may be of interest to you and for your convenience only. However, the Company does not control or endorse such websites and is not responsible for their content nor is it responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, data, opinions, advice, or statements contained within such websites. Please read the terms and conditions of the Usage Policies of any other company or website you may link to from our Services. This Usage Policy applies only to the Company’s Services. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked from our Services, you do so at your own risk. The Company reserves the right to remove any link at any time. The Company disclaims all warranties, express and implied, as to the accuracy, validity, and legality or otherwise of any materials or information contained on such websites.

6\. No Unlawful or Prohibited Use
---------------------------------

As a condition of your use of these Services, you warrant to the Company that you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices. You may not use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Services or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Services.

7\. No Commercial Activities
----------------------------

Posting or transmitting advertising or other such promotional materials or forms of solicitations to other users of the Services is prohibited unless authorized by the Company or an administrator at your education organization.

8\. User Accounts and Security
------------------------------

You can and should notify your Education Organization of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorised disclosure of your password.

You agree you will not access or attempt to access any accounts provided by the Services other than the account(s) assigned to you. If we suspect or detect such inappropriate account access we will inform authorities within your Education Organization.

Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for the suspension or termination of your account, at the Company’s discretion or by direction of your Education Organization, and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.

9\. User Provided Content
-------------------------

Users will be held directly and solely responsible for the content they post on the Services. You acknowledge that you own, are solely responsible or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post on the Services; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this Usage Policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify the Company or its affiliates for all claims resulting from content you supply.

For any content that you post on the Services, all rights, including all intellectual property rights, shall remain the exclusive property of the original owner, and the Company will have a limited, nonexclusive license solely for the purpose of performing its commercial obligations to its Education Organization customer you are a member of, including but not limited to storing, using, translating, and displaying the content.

The license you grant is still in effect even if you stop using the Services. This is required so that for example, content shared by a teacher to other teachers can continue to be provided by Edsby even after that teacher has retired.

The Education Organization through which you are obtaining the Edsby Services has overall control over the disposition of the content you have provided via the Services we operate for it.

The Company reserves the right (but is not obligated) to do any or all of the following:

– Remove content that is abusive, illegal, or disruptive, or that otherwise fails to conform with this Usage Policy

– Terminate a user’s access to any or all portions of the Services upon any breach of this Usage Policy

– Monitor and share with your Education Organization any content in any shared area of the Services

The Company reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary to protect the personal safety of our customers, users, employees or the public. The Company has no liability or responsibility to users of the Services or any other person or entity for performance or non-performance of the aforementioned activities.
