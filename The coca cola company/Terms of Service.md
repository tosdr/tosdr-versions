Nothing in this Section 4 limits Coca‑Cola’s right to restrict access to certain parts of the Services or discontinue the Services or any content that we provide through the Services at any time, without notice or liability to you.

If you do not agree to the Terms as modified, then you must cancel your account and stop using the Services before the end of the notice period. Continued use of the Services after the end of the notice period specified in the notification is deemed acceptance of the Terms as modified.

The modified Terms supersede all previous versions of our agreements, notices or statements of or about these Terms.

### 6\. IS AN ACCOUNT REQUIRED?

### 9\. WHAT ARE PERMITTED USES OF THE SERVICES?

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Coca‑Cola grants you, solely for your non-commercial use, a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, and limited right to access and use the Services and to download one (1) copy of each App.

You must use the Services for lawful, personal and non-commercial purposes only and not for any fraudulent purpose or in connection with any unlawful activity. Without limiting the foregoing, you must not and you agree not to, attempt to or encourage or allow any third party to:

### 10\. DO ANY TERMS APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO USING THE APPS?

Except as expressly stated in this Section 10, these Terms apply to your download and use of our Apps.

Unlike a website, a mobile application is software that is downloaded to and installed on your mobile device. Even though it is downloaded to your mobile device, the Apps are licensed – it is not sold to you. You do not acquire any ownership interest in the Apps or any other right other than to use the Apps in accordance with and subject to these Terms.

You may download a single copy of an App to a mobile device owned or otherwise controlled by you solely for your own personal, non-commercial use. To provide you with certain functionalities, certain of the Apps must access various functions and data on your mobile device. For more information about how personal information is handled by the Apps, please review the [Coca‑Cola Privacy Policy](https://us.coca-cola.com/privacy-policy) (or other privacy policy or notice made available to you when you downloaded an App).

The Apps and the rest of the Services may not have the exact same content.

We may from time to time develop and provide Updates (as defined in Section 4) to an App. Based on your mobile device settings, when your mobile device is connected to the Internet either the App will automatically download and install all available Updates or you may receive notice of or be prompted to download and install available Updates. You agree to download and install all Updates and acknowledge and agree that an App may not properly operate if you do not. All Updates to an App are deemed part of the App and the Services and subject to these Terms.

Coca‑Cola reserves and retains the entire right, title and interest in and to the Apps, including all Coca‑Cola Marks (defined in Section 8) and, as between Coca‑Cola and you, all other copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein or relating thereto, except as expressly granted to you in these Terms.

When you download any of the Apps from Apple's App Store or Google Play (each, an **_App Platform_**), you acknowledge and agree that:

* As between Coca‑Cola and the App Platform, Coca‑Cola is solely responsible for the Apps.
* The App Platform has no obligation to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
* If our App fails to conform to any applicable warranty: (i) you may notify the App Platform and the App Platform may refund the purchase price for an App (if applicable), (ii) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Platform will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apps, and (iii) other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty is, as between Coca‑Cola and the App Platform, Coca‑Cola’s responsibility.
* The App Platform is not responsible for addressing any claim you have relating to the Apps or your possession and use of the Apps.

If a third party claims that an App infringes another party's intellectual property rights, as between the App Platform and Coca‑Cola, Coca‑Cola is responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.

* The App Platform and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of the applicable terms of use as they relate to your license to use an App. Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of our terms of use, the App Platform will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the terms of use as related to your license of an App against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
* You must also comply with all third-party terms applicable through the App Platform when using an App.

To learn more about the specific data collected by any of the Apps, please check your mobile device settings or review the disclosures on the App Platform from which you downloaded the App. To stop the collection of all data through an App, please uninstall it.  

You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

### 11\. WHEN DO THESE TERMS TAKE EFFECT?  WHEN DO THEY TERMINATE?

These Terms are effective when you acknowledge them as part of creating an account, downloading an App or using any of the Services in which these Terms are linked (subject to the exception noted in Section 2). These Terms are in effect until terminated by you or Coca‑Cola.

You may stop using the Services at any time and for any reason. If you want to delete your account, please contact Coca‑Cola using the contact information provided in Section 15 and/or uninstall any or all of the Apps.

If you want to correct or delete the personal information associated with your account, please see the “Your Choices” section of the Coca‑Cola Consumer Privacy Policy (or other privacy policy or notice provided or made available to you).

Coca‑Cola may terminate your account immediately and automatically without any notice if you violate any law applicable to use of the Services. Coca‑Cola reserves the right to terminate an account and access to the Services with or without notice if Coca‑Cola has a reasonable basis to believe that a user is accessing or using the Services in violation of these Terms.

Coca‑Cola may suspend your access to the Services, cancel your account or terminate these Terms at any time without notice if we detect or suspect a breach of security or if Coca‑Cola ceases to offer or support any of the Services, which Coca‑Cola may do in its sole discretion.

We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your access to the Services so that you are able to retrieve any important user Information (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Coca‑Cola.

When these Terms terminate, the rights granted by Coca‑Cola terminate and you must cease all use of the Services and delete all copies of the Apps from your mobile device.

Any provision of these Terms that, by its nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following provisions will survive termination: any limitation on our liability, terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, any obligation you have to pay us, and terms regarding disputes between us. Termination does not and will not limit any of Coca‑Cola’s or your rights and remedies at law or in equity.

### 12\. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LINKED SERVICES?

The Services contains links to other websites and resources provided by third parties (including our marketing agency partners and social media platforms), third-party messaging services (e.g., Whats App) and in advertisements (collectively, **_Linked Services_**). Coca‑Cola cannot and does not control Linked Services even though some Linked Services allow you to export your information to them, such as “like” or “share” features on social media. Please carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of use for all Linked Services. If you decide to access any of the Linked Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the Linked Services and not these Terms.

The Services may include third-party software that is offered generally available free of charge under open source or similar licenses (**_Third Party Software_**). Although the Services provided to you are subject to these Terms, Third Party Software included in the Services may be subject to other licenses or usage terms, which will be presented to you as and when applicable.

### 13\. HOW IS COCA-COLA’S LIABILITY LIMITED UNDER THESE TERMS?

• You will not submit any "objectionable" material for inclusion on personalized product. "Objectionable" means, among other things, anything that (i) is libelous, defamatory, pornographic, sexually explicit, unlawful, racially or ethnically offensive, (ii) infringes on someone else's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other property right, (iii) is something people would consider harassing, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, profane, obscene, or violent, (iv) would breach a person’s privacy or publicity rights, (v) is a misrepresentation of facts, (vi) hate speech, (vii) encourages others to break the law in any way (viii) is intentionally harmful to the Coca‑Cola company or (ix) is otherwise inappropriate.

**Placing Your Order.** When you place an order (by choosing your product, personalizing if applicable and completing the online checkout process), we will send you an order acknowledgement by email. This will detail the products you have ordered. Please note that your completion of the online checkout process does not constitute our acceptance of your order. Our acceptance of your order only takes place when we ship it. A ‘purchase contract’ between you and FortyFour is therefore made at the point of shipment, rather than at the point of payment. If you have cancelled your order, or if we notify you that we cannot accept your order, then no purchase contract will have been made. From time to time, we may not be able to accept an order for the following reasons: (a) Where we cannot obtain authorization for your payment; (b) If you do not meet any eligibility criteria set out in these Terms of Sale; or (c) If the order for personalized products contains reference to any names, words, acronyms, symbols or other content that is not approved by The Coca‑Cola Company.

The Coca‑Cola Company aims to provide you with a fast, high-quality service, so any products you order are immediately sent for production. Please double-check your order on screen and your acknowledgement email carefully to ensure that all the details are correct. We cannot refund items where the personalization has been misspelled due to an error made by you.

Note that there are certain names or phrases that will not be approved for personalization due to their double meanings or cultural and religious sensitivities. The Coca‑Cola Company and FortyFour must and do reserve the absolute right to decline orders for the product that in their sole judgment and discretion contain subject matter that may be considered inappropriate or offensive, including, without limitation, inappropriate, offensive words, acronyms, symbols or other objectionable content as defined above. Products also may not include: (a) product names, trademarks, copyrights, or business names (including but not limited to, restaurant names); (b) celebrity names or specific sports teams having trademark protection; (c) major events, landmarks, religious or political phrases; (d) names of schools or institutions; (e) website names/references; or (f) political content.

**Injunctive Relief.** The arbitrator may not issue any injunction.
