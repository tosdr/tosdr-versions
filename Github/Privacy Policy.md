Secure platform, secure data
----------------------------

We’re constantly improving our security, audit, and compliance solutions with you in mind.

### Platform

We keep GitHub safe, secure, and free of spam and abuse so that this can be the platform where developers come together to create. We do this through significant investments in platform security, incident response, and anti-abuse.

### Open source

Our GitHub Security Lab is a world-class security R&D team. We inspire and enable the community to secure open source at scale, so the world’s software we all depend on sits on foundations you can trust. Our ambition is to be the home where security researchers and developers can collaborate to make security easy for everyone willing to secure open source.

### Customers

We help our customers' security and risk teams feel confident in their decisions to encourage developer collaboration on GitHub. We recognize that security is a shared responsibility with our customers. We are proud to partner with your security, risk, and procurement teams to provide the information needed for risk assessments and true understanding of our security and compliance posture.

### Features

Ship secure applications within the GitHub flow: Stay ahead of security issues, leverage the security community’s expertise, and use open source securely.

[Explore GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security)   
[Learn more about GitHub’s Security features](https://help.github.com/features/security) 

### Products

We embody the shift toward investments in safe and secure software design practices with our world-class security engineering program. We embed security expertise and capabilities into every phase of our Software Development Lifecycle.

Our Product Security Engineering team empowers developers to create a secure platform and products. Through developer training, the creation of components that form a secure foundation to build on, automated code analysis, in-depth threat modeling, and security code review and testing, we prevent vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development lifecycle.

Once our product is out the door, our security testing doesn’t stop. In addition to our internal Red Team, we leverage the collective expertise of the security research community through our [Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) to provide ongoing and broadly-scoped review.

[Help us keep the world’s software safe](https://bounty.github.com/)

Safe and secure by design
