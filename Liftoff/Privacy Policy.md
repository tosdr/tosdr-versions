B. Information We Collect and Use About Targeted End Users When They Interact With Our Customers’ Mobile Applications

If you are a Targeted End User, we collect certain device information provided by our advertising exchange Partners or our Customers which we process it for the following purposes (based on the following legal basis if you are located in the UK / EEA):

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personal Information | Purpose | Legal Basis |
| Generic geographic location consisting of IP address and explicit geographical categorization such as country or zip code and then granular latitude and longitude coordinates (please note that this is subject to the capability of the advertising exchange that we use, and so this data is not always collected by us);<br><br>Carrier;<br><br>Device make, manufacturer, operating system and language settings;<br><br>Name of application interactive with Liftoff Services;<br><br>Internet Protocol Address;<br><br>Device ID;<br><br>Browser type;<br><br>Internet service provider (ISP);<br><br>Android ID or Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA);<br><br>Connection speed;<br><br>App usage data;<br><br>Referring / exit pages;<br><br>Files viewed on our Site (e.g. HTML pages, graphic, etc.);<br><br>Date / time stamp;<br><br>Clickstream data;<br><br>Your preferences regarding the processing of your data, based on the information you have received. | Using limited data to select advertising: Advertising presented to you on a Customer’s app can be based on limited data, such as the app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you). | Consent |
| Creating profiles for personalised advertising: Information about your activity on a Customer’s app (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on a Customer’s app and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities. | Consent |
| Using profiles to select personalised advertising: Advertising presented to you on a Customer’s app can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on that app or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. | Consent |
| Measuring advertising performance: Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or download an app, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns. | Consent |
| Understanding audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources: eports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents). | Consent |
| Developing and improving services:  Information about your activity a Customer’s app, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers. | Consent |
| Ensuring security, preventing and detecting fraud, and fix errors: our data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them. | Legitimate interests (it is in the interests of us, our clients, and you to ensure that ads are served in a safe and error free way and that fraudulent third parties do not distort the true price to be paid for showing you ads) |
| Delivering and presenting advertising and content: Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device. | Legitimate interests (it is in the interests of us, as a core aspect of our business, to help to serve the ads, whether personalised or not, at a technical level) |
| Save and communicate privacy choices: The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in any consent mechanism show to you on a website or app you visit are saved and made available to us in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable us, and Partners with which we share these details, to respect your privacy choices. | Legitimate interests (it is in the interests of us, as an advertising platform, to understand the choices you have made about how we can use your data so that we can respect them, and to share details of these choices with Partners, so that they can do the same) |
| Preserving and sharing information with others including law enforcement, responding to legal requests and establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights | Legitimate interests (protecting our rights, personnel, property or products, or those of others);<br><br>Compliance with legal obligations |
| To follow applicable laws and regulations | Compliance with legal obligations |

In pursuit of the above purposes, we do the following:

* Match and combine data from other data sources: Information about your activity on a Customer’s app service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice;
* Link different devices: In support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices);
* Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically: Your device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice;
* Use precise geolocation data: With your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.
* Actively scan device characteristics for identification: With your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be requested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes explained in this notice.

Our Privacy Principles for the use of data about Targeted End Users

* Liftoff’s systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents. For instance: users with iPhone X’s in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times.
* Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user’s consent. For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.

* Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app. E.g. user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.
* This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps.

* Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising. Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the user’s consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.
* Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data
* Details of how to opt-out of interest based advertising from us can be found at: [https://liftoff.io/opt-out/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://liftoff.io/opt-out/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733940758119916&usg=AOvVaw2S6mCi9NhCOGuJrrmgypbC).

User Data Supplementation

We may receive information about you from other sources as required in connection with our legitimate interests, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data (including marketing data). We combine this data with information we already have about you to help us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new Customers, deliver our marketing services and provide more tailored advertising, products and Services.  If you provide us with personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Liftoff and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around our Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. A full list of cookies we use on this site is found on our [Cookie Policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://liftoff.io/cookie-policy/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733940758128238&usg=AOvVaw07DCormS9u3ez4Kl7lgZgt).

You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Site or Services.

Automated decision making

We perform the following automated decision making processes using your personal information:

* To build lookalike targeting models to target users who are similar to the Customer’s existing users. Our Machine Learning does this automatically for every Customer. The more upfront device IDs Liftoff has, the more beneficial this is.
* For power predictive ML features e.g. users who have purchased in the past are much more likely to purchase again in the future
* To exclude existing users from User Acquisition campaigns, and power targeting rules for re-engagement campaigns e.g. target users who have registered but not purchased.

These measures may include the following:

However, we do share your personal information with third parties as described in Section III and in this Section. If you have consented to us sharing your personal information but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.

Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control

In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You will be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is necessary and related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies. This privacy policy applies only to personal information that we collect through the Site and Services. If you have any questions about these practices, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://liftoff.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or [\[email protected\]](https://liftoff.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Service Providers

We employ third party companies and people, for example cloud service providers (“Third Party Service Providers”), such as Amazon Web Services, Dropbox, Salesforce and [Unity Technologies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733940758132310&usg=AOvVaw1MadjhcZHyVaKK0vS7bg5b) to perform tasks e.g., provide computer and network infrastructure services on our behalf or as advertising exchange partners and we may need to share your information with them to provide products or Services to you. We only share your personal information with Third Party Service Providers to the extent necessary for them to assist us and they do not have any right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also work with Google to deliver the best advertising opportunities to its clients through the use of remarketing tags. Traffic Clients and other data subjects can consult Google’s policies to learn more about Google’s processing policies [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl%3Den-US&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733940758132606&usg=AOvVaw2JONlmnAgj8W29zm8CQRB4).

Third Party Digital Advertising Partners

If you are a Targeted End User, we will share data about you with Partners, to be used by those Partners for advertising-related purposes, including establishing (on behalf of advertisers) whether to bid on the opportunity to show you ads. When we share data in this manner, we will also share with the relevant Partner details about whether you have consented to, or objected to, the use of your data by the Partner for specified purposes.

Group Companies

We may provide your personal information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf to provide the Site and the Services to you. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this privacy policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information.

Compliance with laws and legal proceedings

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

VI. SECURITY

The security of your personal information is important to us.  Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure. Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us

We take appropriate steps to pseudonymize your personal data. For Targeted End Users, the advertising device IDs (which are the only per-user identifiers that we track, and can be reset by the user at any time) are SHA1-hashed before insertion. Since SHA1 is a one-way hashing algorithm, the original raw advertising device ID cannot be reverse-engineered from the hashed version.

If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://liftoff.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or [\[email protected\]](https://liftoff.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

VII. DATA RETENTION

If you have provided us with personal information for the purposes of holding an account with us, we will retain your information (including personal information) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.

If we hold information about you through any other means we shall only process this information for as long as is necessary for the purpose and in any event for no longer than 28 days.

Information relating to Targeted End Users is retained for 30 days in pseudonymized form before it is automatically deleted from our active database. Backups are stored indefinitely.

We will delete it after the timescales stated above, except we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
