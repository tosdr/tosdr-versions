We encourage you to read them.

What data we collect about you

### What data we collect about you

**Data you provide about yourself**  
We collect your personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, you may give us: your email address, country of residence, and areas of interest if you choose to receive newsletters, updates, or other information from us; your contact information, and any other personal data you choose to include, if you email, text, or instant message us, or contact us through our sites and tools; and any personal data contained in, or included with, any proposal documents, social media posts, articles, feedback, comments, responses, messages, chats, photos, videos, or other data or content you submit via our sites and tools. Please do not disclose more personal data than is necessary.

It is always your choice whether to provide this personal data. However, some personal data must be provided to enable certain functions of our sites and tools or enable you to participate in certain programs, activities, or events (such as to sign up for a newsletter, apply for a job, or register to participate in one of our events), so the decision not to provide such personal data might limit or eliminate such functions or your ability to participate in those programs, activities, or events.

**Personal data you provide about others**  
Do not provide personal data about others unless you are authorized or required to do so by contract or applicable law. You may provide personal data on behalf of another person if you have provided them with a copy of this notice, and any applicable supplemental privacy notice, and obtained their explicit or express consent. We may ask you to provide evidence of that notice and consent.

**Data we receive from third parties and other sources**  
We may receive personal data about you from other sources, including your company/organization, professional references, publicly available sources, third-party analytics providers, our services providers, and other third parties. For example, we may receive your personal data if: another person designates you as a contact person for your company/organization or includes information about you in proposal documents, social media posts, articles, feedback, comments, responses, messages, chats, photos, videos, or other data or content submitted through our sites and tools; or one of our employees or service providers or a third party acting on apparent authority provides it to us (for example, when registering you to access one of our sites and tools, access our facilities, apply for a job, or participate in one of our activities or events).

**Payment processors**  
We may engage third parties (“Payment Processors”) to process donations or other payments you make to us. In some cases, such donations or payments are made directly through one of our sites and tools. If so, we may ask you to provide payment, credit card, or other credit-related information, which we will share with the Payment Processor for the purpose of processing your payment. In other cases, you may be redirected to the Payment Processor’s site to make your donation or other payment. If so, the data collection and use practices of the Payment Processor’s site will be governed by that site’s privacy notice, statement, or policy, and its terms of use. We encourage you to read them.

**Interest-based advertising**  
We may engage third parties to place our interest-based advertisements across the Internet for the purpose of engaging and informing you about our organization, activities we fund, and the issues we care about. These third parties may use tracking technologies to collect information about your visits to our sites and tools and other websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. Some advertisements may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information collected about your visits to our sites and tools and elsewhere over time.

You may opt out of our collection and use of this information at any time and, in some jurisdictions, we will only engage in interest-based advertising if you have opted in. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices concerning interest-based advertisements, please [contact us](#how_to_contact_us) or visit:

**Legal bases under applicable law  
**We may collect and use your personal data only if we have one or more legal bases for doing so under applicable law. The legal basis or bases will depend on your relationship to us and/or your interaction with our sites and tools. Examples of legal bases on which we rely include where processing is necessary to:

When we share your data

### When we share your data

**Employees, agents, affiliates, service providers, and partners**  
We may share your personal data with our: (a) employees, agents, and affiliates who have a business need to know; (b) our services providers (including supplemental staff, project workers, inbound secondees, and outsourced service workers) to process it for us based on our instructions and for no other purpose; and (c) with third-party partners that are collaborating with us to fund or conduct projects or host events. We do not share your personal data with any third party (including our service providers) for marketing purposes unless you have provided consent for us to do so.

We may share your personal data with law enforcement, other government agencies or authorities, or third parties as required by applicable law, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on us.

How we store and protect your data

### How we store and protect your data

**Storage and transfers**  
Your personal data may be stored in your region or in any other country where we or our service providers have facilities. We may also allow employees and service providers located around the world to access personal data as provided in this notice. We will ensure your legal rights and protections travel with any such “transfer” of your personal data as required by applicable law. We do this by signing agreements containing appropriate data protection terms (including “standard contractual clauses,” “standard contracts,” or other terms as may be required by applicable law) and requiring that our employees and service providers protect personal data in accordance with applicable law.

**Storage period**  
We will store your personal data until it is no longer needed to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected or as otherwise required or permitted by law. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your personal data or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. We may dispose of any data at our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law. Please [contact us](#how_to_contact_us) if you would like more details regarding our retention periods for different categories of personal data.

**Protection**  
As the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our sites and tools and any such transmission is at your own risk. However, we maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures, including performing regular self-assessments, to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data. We limit access to personal data and require that employees authorized to access personal data maintain the confidentiality of that data. We hold our service providers to at least the same data privacy and security standards to which we hold ourselves. Our standard information security requirements for service providers are available [here](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/ISR-Home.pdf).

### How you can manage communications from us and exercise other rights you may have to your personal data

If you do not wish to receive such promotional communications from us, you can opt out at any time by following the instructions contained in the communications themselves. If you opt out of receiving these promotional communications, please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to our sites and tools, including administrative messages.

Supplemental privacy notice for job applicants

### BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVACY NOTICE FOR JOB APPLICANTS 

This notice supplements our [Privacy & Cookies Notice](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/privacy-and-cookies-notice) and describes how we collect, use, share, and retain additional personal data when you participate in our job application process, and how you can access and control this additional data. Please let us know if you have any questions about this supplemental notice.

### What additional data we collect about you

**Data you provide about yourself**  
When you participate in our job application process, we will ask you to provide personal data such as: your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number; your resume/CV, work experience, educational history, and skills; links to any relevant websites or your LinkedIn profile; whether you are legally authorized to work in the country in which the position you have applied for is located; whether you will require sponsorship to obtain legal authorization to work in a particular country; whether you are 18 years or older; and whether you are currently working for a grantee of ours. In addition, we will ask you to voluntarily provide information regarding your gender, veteran status, ethnicity, and disability status. This information, or your decision not to provide this information, will not impact your application in any way.

Before uploading a resume, please remove any sensitive personal data such as government-issued ID numbers, financial information, photos, dates of birth, etc. We do not require or wish to receive sensitive personal data in a resume.

**Data we receive from other sources**  
We may receive personal data about you from other sources, your references, prior employers, a person or company/organization authorized by you to submit an application on your behalf, and/or publicly-available sources.

**Data we collect from consumer reports or consumer investigative reports**  
If we think you might be a good fit for a position, we may ask you to authorize us to obtain a consumer report or investigative consumer report. A consumer report is a report on credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used as a factor in establishing an applicant’s eligibility for employment. An investigative consumer report is similar, but the information is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, associates, or acquaintances. Both kinds of reports may include information from court, administrative, or criminal records if and to the extent permitted by applicable law. If you choose not to provide this authorization upon request, we will not be able to offer you employment.

### How we use this additional data

**General**  
In addition to the uses specified under the [Privacy & Cookies Notice](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/privacy-and-cookies-notice), we may use this additional data to: identify and contact applicants _\[for our legitimate interests\]_; evaluate applicants and make hiring decisions _\[for our legitimate interests\]_; match applicants to other career opportunities with us _\[for our legitimate interests\]_; prepare applicants for employment if a job has been offered and accepted _\[for our legitimate interests and/or to perform a contract with you\]_; keep records related to our hiring practices _\[for our legitimate interests and/or to comply with legal obligations\]_; comply with applicable employment-related laws such as checking names against anti-terrorism lists, complying with immigration restrictions, or assisting the government in an investigation _\[to comply with legal obligations\]_. If you are hired by us as an employee, this information may be used for additional employment and business purposes subject to any internal privacy policies and notices. _\[for our legitimate interests and/or to perform a contract with you\]_.

**Sensitive personal data and criminal offense data**  
We believe our employees should reflect the rich diversity of the global populations we aim to serve, and we support this diversity through all our employment practices. Accordingly, we ask applicants to provide information regarding their gender, veteran status, and ethnicity. To the extent required by applicable law, we will seek your explicit or express consent prior to collecting and using such information. If you choose to provide such information, we will keep it separate from your application and use it solely for the purpose of monitoring, informing, and reporting on our diversity efforts _\[for our legitimate interests, and for the purposes of complying with our obligations under employment law to monitor the equality of our employment practices\]_. We process criminal offence data in the context of a consumer report, or consumer investigative report _\[for our legitimate interests, and for the purposes of complying with our obligations to provide a safe workplace for our employees and guests\]_.

### When we share this additional data

We may share your personal data with service providers (including Workday, Inc., recruiters, and other third parties) that assist us with recruiting, application, and employment processes and our affiliates and other third parties with whom you might work if you are offered and accept the job. We will not share your sensitive personal data with third parties without your explicit or express consent.

### How long we keep this additional data

We store personal data of all applicants in accordance with the [Privacy & Cookies Notice](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/privacy-and-cookies-notice). If you accept a job with us, we may retain your application and any other information we relied on during the application process as part of your employee file. Please note that we have the right to delete accounts and application information at any time, so you may want to retain copies of any information, including resumes/CVs, you provide to us during the application process.

Supplemental notice for reporters of improper conduct

### BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVACY NOTICE FOR REPORTERS OF IMPROPER CONDUCT 

This notice supplements our [Privacy & Cookies Notice](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/privacy-and-cookies-notice) and describes how we collect, use, share, and retain additional personal data when you report possible illegal, unethical, or improper conduct using EthicsPoint™.

### Note regarding limitations on using EthicsPoint™ to submit a report

In some countries, regulations limit how a service may be used to report concerns. For example, local laws may:

* Limit the topic of concern to certain areas of compliance such as anti-bribery, auditing and accounting, banking, and financial matters;
* Prohibit anonymous reports; or
* Disallow reports concerning our personnel except employees in key or management functions.

Accordingly, we may be limited in our ability to respond to a report submitted through EthicsPoint™ depending on the country of your location or where the reported conduct took place.

**Data you provide about yourself**  
When reporting improper conduct, unless you choose to report anonymously, we may ask you to provide personal data about yourself, such as your name and contact information (e.g., phone number and/or email address). We will ask you to provide a description of the conduct reported.

The information you submit will be treated as confidential, except where required otherwise by applicable law, but in all cases, will be handled with sensitivity. We encourage you to identify yourself (in lieu of reporting anonymously) so that we can follow up with you about any questions we may have and so we may best address the issues raised.

**Data you provide about others**  
When reporting improper conduct, we may ask you to provide the name and contact information of the persons in your report. We will ask you to provide a description of the conduct reported, which also may include other personal data about the persons in your report.

As the information you report may result in decisions adverse to others, we ask that you carefully consider the information that you provide in advance and report only what you believe to be true. We do not retaliate for the good-faith reporting of ethical or compliance issues even if such report may later be determined to be factually incorrect. Knowingly providing false or misleading information, however, will not be tolerated.

### How we use this additional data

### When we share this additional data

**General**  
We may share your personal data with our employees, representatives, agents, external legal counsel, and service providers who have a need to know the information to conduct an investigation or respond to claims relating to the reported conduct. We also may share your personal data with law enforcement if required by applicable law.

**Subject of the report**  
We will promptly notify any person who is the subject of a report, except where notice needs to be delayed to help ensure the integrity of the investigation or the preservation of relevant information. With some exceptions, the subject of the report may access information concerning the report, but not the identity of the reporter, and may in certain cases request correction of personal data that is inaccurate or incomplete in accordance with applicable law.

### How long we keep this additional data

The information you provide will be kept as long as necessary to conduct an investigation, maintain records of that investigation and any actions taken, or, if applicable, as long as necessary to fulfill our legal requirements.
