(b) acknowledge and agree that, subject to applicable law, we may keep User Contributions indefinitely and disclose them for any purpose, including but not limited to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce these Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any User Contribution violates the rights of third parties; or (iv) without undertaking a duty to do so, protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Foundation, its users, and the public;

If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. You and the Foundation intend that the provisions of these Terms be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Accordingly, you and the Foundation agree that if any provision of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, where possible, it will be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, which may include its deletion. Section titles are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual significance. Any list of examples following “including” or “e.g.,” is illustrative and not exhaustive, unless qualified by terms like “only” or “solely.” The Foundation may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign these Terms or assign, transfer, or sublicense any rights or delegate any duties hereunder. The Foundation’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. A waiver will only be binding on the Foundation if it is in a written document signed by the Foundation. Both you and the Foundation warrant to each other that, in entering these Terms, neither the Foundation nor you have relied on, or will have any right or remedy based upon, any statement, representation, warranty, or assurance other than those expressly stated in these Terms. The preceding sentence will not limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law. No one other than you and the Foundation, or the Foundation’s successors and permitted assigns, will have any right to enforce any of these Terms. These Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, agreements, or communications between you and us, whether written or verbal, regarding the subject matter of these Terms.
