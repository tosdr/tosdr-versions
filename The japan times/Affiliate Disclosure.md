You do not need prior permission to create a link to a page on The Japan Times. However, The Japan Times reserves the right to revoke this permission if a link implies that The Japan Times is promoting or endorsing an unapproved site.

If you would like to post a brief excerpt of an article from one of our sites on your website or blog, please limit the number of excerpted words to 20 percent of the original article. For example, if an article is 800 words, you may post an excerpt of up to 160 words on your site.

The following two conditions must also be honored:

* Clear attribution to The Japan Times within close proximity of the excerpt.
* A clickable link back to the story from which you have quoted.

Sample:

“U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Foreign Minister Taro Aso call for a swift, tough and coordinated response to Pyongyang’s Oct. 9 nuclear test, as satellite data indicate the North, which has defiantly called sanctions a declaration of war, may be preparing further tests.”  
– From [The Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/)

You may vary this sample’s format slightly in accordance with your site’s style, but both elements should be in place. If the two above conditions are not met, The Japan Times reserves the right to revoke this permission.
