Cookie Policy
=============

**Introduction**  
Tealium is committed to being transparent with you about how we collect and use your personal information. This policy applies to your personal information that we collect using cookies, as defined below.

The only cookies we will set by default on your device are necessary cookies. Necessary cookies can be considered as those that are required technically, at a minimum, to make the website (or web application) operate. All other cookies require your consent to be set. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time for any processing activities that you have consented to.

**Tealium Use of Cookies**  
Tealium uses cookies or tracers for the following purposes:

* to improve your user experience of our websites
* ensure website functionality
* to generate usage statistics
* to remember your preferences
* to provide you with relevant advertising or marketing information.

The types of cookies we use may include HTTP cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, clear gifs, or invisible pixels. For the purpose of this notice, we will refer to these collectively as “cookies.”

**Our Cookies**  
Cookies are usually small text files stored on a device, such as a PC, a mobile device, or any other device that can store information and are often set by websites when a user visits them. Cookies as defined within this statement also include similar technologies, such as pixels, local storage, and software development kits (SDKs).

The information stored in cookies can include personal data, such as an IP address, a username, a unique identifier, or an email address. But it may also contain non personal data such as language settings or information about the type of device a person is using to browse the site. Advertising IDs, user IDs, and other tracking IDs may also be contained in cookies.

**Necessary Cookies**  
These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

**Analytics Cookies**  
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site.

**Marketing Cookies**  
These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not directly store personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

**Personalization Cookies**  
These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
