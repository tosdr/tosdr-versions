While the list is subject to change from time to time, the categories of use described below will not change without notice.

| Category | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Essential Cookies** | These cookies are essential for you to browse the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the site, holding items in your cart while you are shopping online and remembering your privacy settings are an example of strictly necessary cookies. Essential cookies are necessary for the site to function and cannot be rejected. |
| **Functional Cookies** | These cookies allow a website to remember choices you have made in the past, like what language you prefer, or what your user name and password are so you can automatically log in.  <br>  <br>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. |
| **Performance Cookies** | These cookies collect information about how you use a website, like which pages you visited, and which links you clicked on. None of this information can be used to identify you. It is all aggregated and, therefore, depersonalized. Their sole purpose is to improve website functions. |

###### How to Manage Your Cookies

Because we respect your right to privacy, you can choose not to allow some types of cookies. You may manage the cookies that Snapfish uses through the settings in our [**Privacy Preference Center**](javascript:Optanon.ToggleInfoDisplay();). You may withdraw consent to future uses at any time through this feature. Essential cookies – those that are necessary to the functioning of our sites and apps and to provide the service you requested (for example, a cookie to remember that you do not want any cookies set when you revisit the Services) – cannot be disabled. Please be aware that blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services we are able to offer.

You can also delete or prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of this site. For more information about how to control or delete cookies, visit [www.aboutcookies.org.](https://www.aboutcookies.org/)

Depending on where you live, you may be able to access one convenient place to indicate your preferences, including the option to make one “universal” opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities. For example, in the United States, you can visit this site: [Ad Choices](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). In the EU, you can visit this site: [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). When you opt-out using these methods, a cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you have opted-out of interest-based advertising. If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt-out again. These websites also provide detailed information about interest-based advertising and tips for managing your online privacy.

###### “Do-Not-Track” Technologies

Internet browsers can transmit “Do Not Track” signals that indicate that a user does not wish to have activity tracked. Currently, no universally accepted standard exists for how to interpret such signals. We do not respond to web browser “Do-Not-Track” signals.

###### How Snapfish Notifies You of Changes to this Cookie Notice

We periodically update this Cookie Notice to account for changed legal and operational circumstances, to describe new cookies and tracking technologies, and how those changes affect our use of your information. When we do so, we will update the “Effective Date” above. We encourage you to review this Cookie Notice each time you use our Services. If we are going to use information in a manner that is materially different from that stated at the time of collection or make any material changes in our privacy practices, we will notify you through a prominent notice on our Services and we may notify you via email at the email address we have on file for you. If you do not agree to the changes made to this Cookie Notice, we recommend that you stop using our Services or disable your cookies.
