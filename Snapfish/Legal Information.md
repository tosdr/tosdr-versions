SNAPFISH PRIVACY NOTICE

Effective Date: October 10, 2024

At Snapfish, our purpose is to help our customers capture, preserve, and share life’s important moments through professional and personal photography, and personalized products. We are committed to respecting your privacy.

This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) explains how Snapfish (“Snapfish,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects and uses personal information and the choices you can make.

Our Sites and Apps may be linked on other websites or may contain links to other websites. Our Privacy Notice only applies to our Sites and Apps, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices, security standards, or content of other sites.

If you interact with content on our social media profiles (for example, if you “like” or share a post from our Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts), those social media sites may share information about you with us, including your public profile, e-mail address and friend list. If you choose to “like” or share content, information about you may be publicly displayed on the social network, depending on your privacy settings. You should review the Privacy Notice of that social media site and check your privacy settings through that site. If you post information on a social media or another third-party service that references us or our products and services (e.g., via a Twitter hashtag), we may publish your post on our social media accounts or websites.

**Information You Provide About Others**  
The content you choose to upload to our service, including your photos and the information you store in your address book, may include personal information of others. If you choose to share your photographs or other information with someone else through a feature we offer, we will use the personal information you provide (for example, the e-mail address of the recipient) to fulfill your request and for other purposes described in this Privacy Notice. Before you upload and/or share personal information of others through our service, please ensure that you have the consent of such persons to do so.

**Other Information Contained in Your Photos**  
When you upload your photos to our platforms or give us permission to access the photos stored on your device, your photo content may also include related image information such as the time and the place your photo was taken, tags and similar information stored by your image capture device. If you wish to restrict the transfer of image metadata in your individual photos, please adjust the settings on your image capture device.

**Cookies**  
We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect your information when you are using our services – for example what web or mobile pages you have viewed – to administer our services, analyze trends, generate analytics, provide a better user experience, improve our products and services, detect and prevent fraud or security incidents, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Our Sites, Apps and emails use pixels, tags, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies (collectively referred to as “Cookies”) that are created when you use our online services and are stored on your computer or mobile device. Cookies help us offer convenient features like storing the contents of your shopping cart until you are ready to check out, remembering your login and account settings, recognizing your browser when you visit, customizing your current and future visits, and providing you with information about products that interest you. Cookies help us personalize your experience and save time during checkout. We also use the information we collect to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our site to monitor site traffic, develop marketing programs, and improve our website design and content.

We use the information collected by our third-party service providers using Cookies to analyze and track data, improve our services, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand our users’ online activity. Our service providers may also show you advertisements for our products and services on other websites and may combine this information with other information those service providers have gathered about your visits to those other websites so that the advertisements you receive are more likely to be of interest to you.

You can control cookies through your browser setting and through tools we make available through our Services. For more information about cookies and other tracking technologies we use, including how to disable them, please refer to our [Cookie Notice](https://www.snapfish.com/cookienotice).

**Other Sources**  
We may also obtain data that is publicly available or from third party sources, such as address verification services or third-party marketing database partners, to improve the accuracy of and add to what we know about our customers and prospective customers. We may combine this information with your personal information for the purposes described in this Notice.

**Employment**  
In addition to information collected from our customers, we and our service providers also collect certain information from candidates who apply for a job with [Snapfish and our family of brands](https://shutterflyinc.com/our-brands/) to contact you about your application and evaluate your qualifications for the position, including your name, phone number, e-mail address, postal address, education information, employment information, information you provide in connection with your application, information you make available on your social media accounts, information that is available publicly, and information you authorize us to collect via third parties, including former employers or references.

In certain circumstances, you may submit your application for employment through a third-party service that displays our job posting. We do not control the privacy practices of these third-party services. Please review their privacy policies carefully prior to submitting your application materials.

**How long do we retain the personal information we collect about you?**

Snapfish will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Notice, for as long as you maintain an account, or as needed to provide the Sites, Apps, and associated services (Services) to you. If you no longer want Snapfish to use your information to provide the Services to you, you may close your account. Snapfish will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax laws), resolve disputes, perform and enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this Notice.

**How do we share your information with third parties?**

We do not “sell” personal information in the ordinary sense of that term. That is, we don’t provide your personally identifiable information to third parties in exchange for money. We may share personal information in the following situations.

**Service Providers**  
We sometimes use third-party service providers to act on our behalf, for example to help us deliver our services, fulfill your product orders, process payments, enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, deliver our advertisements, and to provide professional, marketing, security, and information technology services. These service providers are only allowed to use your information in connection with the specific service they provide on our behalf.

**Partners and Affiliates**  
Snapfish is part of the [Shutterfly family](https://www.shutterflyinc.com/brands/) of companies and brands. We may share your information among our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries for purposes described in this Notice. This allows us to offer features such as the ability to use your Snapfish account credentials across all of our Web properties and applications where available.

We also work with third parties who act as our partners to offer you joint products and services – for example, we work with prominent retailers to offer ship-to-store options to customers in many locations. If you decide to use such products or services, we will share certain information about you with our partners for use as needed to enable us to provide the service.

Your membership in other organizations and/or retail membership programs we partner with may entitle you to special offers on our Sites and Apps, in which case we share offer redemption information (which may include your information) with the partner as necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.

**Law Enforcement, Mergers, and Other Situations**  
We may be required to share your personal information in other, limited circumstances. For example, we may be required to share certain information to respond to a subpoena or similar judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies. If necessary, we may also share information with law enforcement without a subpoena or similar judicial process if doing so may help protect the personal safety of a customer, a photo subject, or members of the public. We reserve the right to report to the appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any information that we believe may be evidence of criminal activity or violation of any applicable law.

Additionally, your information may be transferred to another organization if, for example, we negotiate for or transfer the ownership or operation of the Sites and Apps because we have merged with or have been acquired by another organization, if we liquidate our assets, if there is a change in control, or a financing transaction. In those cases, the new company’s use of your information will still be subject to this Notice and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

**Does our website collect information from children?**

Our Sites and Apps are intended for use by general audiences and are not targeted directly at children. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal information through our websites or apps, we will remove their personally identifiable information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided such information through our websites or apps, the parent or guardian should contact us in writing at [privacy@snapfish.com](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com) so that we may respond appropriately.

**What options do you have to limit our collection and use of your personal information?**

You have choices about how your information is collected and used. You can notify us of your preferences when you create an account with us, and if you would like to review, correct or delete your personal information on our Sites and Apps, you can do so via your account settings. There may be times when we are unable to fulfill your request – for example, if providing access to your personal information would reveal confidential commercial or proprietary information or personal information about someone else (and we cannot separate your data), if we are prohibited by law from disclosing the information, or if we have a legal obligation to retain certain data. We may require additional personal information from you for the purposes of verifying your identity and rights.

Some jurisdictions provide additional legal rights, as described in our Supplemental Notices below.

**Opting out of Marketing Communications**  
If you no longer want to receive marketing communications from us, you can unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages you receive, by changing your marketing preferences through your Account Settings, or by contacting us through [Customer Service](https://support.snapfish.com/hc/en-us). We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the services we provide, such as service announcements and administrative messages (for example, communications related to a pending order, an unresolved customer service issue, or a Notice update). We do not offer you the ability to opt-out of receiving those communications.

**Cookie Options**  
You may manage the cookies that Snapfish uses through the settings in our Privacy Preference Center, which can be found in our Cookie Notice in the footer of Snapfish web pages.

You may also change your web browser settings to reject Cookies from the site or to alert you before a cookie is placed on your computer. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs only apply to the specific computer and browser on which the opt-out cookie is applied. If you clear cookies from your device, your opt-out will no longer be valid and you will need to opt out again where you want your choices to apply. If you accept a cookie, you can delete it at any time through your web browser. If you choose not to accept Cookies, though, you will not be able to enjoy all the features available to our registered users.

The Network Advertising Alliance (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) offer opt-out tools to help you manage your choices for participating companies that use Cookies for Interest-Based Advertising and cross-app advertising. For more information about these tools please visit: [NAI Opt-Out Page](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) and [DAA Opt-Out Page](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). You can also opt out of Google cookies by installing [Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), and/or the [Google Advertising Cookie out-out browser add-on.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/optoutplugin/eula.html)

“Do Not Track” is a preference you can set in your web browser to let the sites you visit know that you do not want them collecting information about you. Our sites do not currently respond to all “Do Not Track” settings; however, we treat Global Privacy Control signals as requests to opt out of the “sale or sharing” of personal information pursuant to the California Privacy Rights Act.

**How do we keep your information secure?**

Although no website, application, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof,” we have safeguards in place to protect against unauthorized access and disclosures of the personal information we control, including technical, physical, and administrative safeguards and security measures. Despite these measures, however, we cannot guarantee that our information security safeguards will never be compromised.

**How do we make updates to this Notice?**

As we implement new technology and introduce new services or otherwise change our privacy practices, or in response to changes in applicable laws or regulations, we may modify this Notice and provide notice to you by posting updates on this page. Please check back periodically to view any updates. Changes to our Notice will become effective when posted. If we change this Privacy Notice in a material way, we will endeavor to promptly notify our customers.

**How can you contact us with questions about your privacy or this Notice?**

For further information regarding this website privacy statement or related Snapfish policies and procedures, please contact: [privacy@snapfish.com](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com)

**Supplemental Notice to Residents of CA, CO, CT, MT, OR, TX, UT and VA**

Depending on where you reside, you may also have additional legal rights with respect to your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply in limited cases. Consistent with applicable laws, this Supplemental Notice provides a way to exercise such rights for residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia.. For information about what categories of personal information we may collect from our customers, the sources of that information, the purposes for collecting and using that information, and what types of service providers we may share that information with, please see above our section titled **[What personal information do we collect? How do we use that information?](https://www.shutterflyinc.com/privacy/#what-personal-info)**

The laws of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia grant some or all of the following rights to consumers who reside in those states:

* The right to request information about personal information that we have collected about that customer in the 12 months preceding the customer’s request – including the categories of information collected, the source of that information, the business purpose of that collection, the categories of third parties with whom that information is shared, and the specific personal information collected about that particular customer;
* The right to receive requested information in a readily-usable and portable format if provided electronically;
* The right to request that we delete any personal information about the consumer that we have collected (although we may be entitled to retain some information for certain purposes); to exercise this right, please use our online tools available in your account;
* The right to opt-out of “sales” of personal information to third parties, the sharing of personal information with third parties for targeted advertising purposes, and/or the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes;
* The right to update or correct any personal information which is out of date or incorrect; and
* The right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your privacy rights.

To exercise your rights under this Supplemental Notice, please make your request online at [Snapfish data privacy rights](https://www.snapfish.com/loginto?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snapfish.com%2Fprivacy-data-rights) or contact us at [privacy@snapfish.com](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com), or call 1-877-835-5091. **Note that use of our online data privacy tool will resolve your requests more quickly than phone requests**.

We cannot respond to your request to access or delete information unless we are able to both verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you and/or your household. If you have an account on any of our Sites and Apps, we will verify your identity by having you log in to your account. If you do not have an account on our Sites and Apps, we will attempt to verify your request by asking you to provide identifying information that we will match to information in our files. We will only use information you provide in your request for the purpose of verifying your identity or authority to make the request. For account and non-account holders, we will also send you an email after you make a request to which you must reply.

You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. Your agent will need to provide a Power of Attorney authorizing the agent to act on your behalf, or will need to complete the same verification procedures that would be required for a request submitted by you directly, and provide information that allows us to verify your authorization. If you would like to appeal a decision related to a request to exercise your rights under this Supplemental Notice, please contact us at the phone numbers, online forms, or email address listed above.

We may deny deletion requests in whole or in part as permitted or required by applicable law. We do not charge a different price or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services based on your exercising your privacy rights. We do not sell personal information in the ordinary sense of that term. That is, we don’t provide your personally identifiable information to third parties in exchange for money. But under California law, sharing information with third parties for targeted advertising purposes may be considered a “sale” of personal information. Residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia have the ability to opt out of such sharing using the above methods.

**Supplemental Notice to Residents of California**

If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this Notice is posted, you may request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted on such site. To make such a request, please send an email with the subject line “California Minor Content Removal Request” to [privacy@snapfish.com.](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com) Please specify in your request which website or application your request relates to and the specific information or content that you would like removed. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, because, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another visitor to our websites.

If you are a former Snapfish employee and would like to exercise your rights with respect to personal data we collected in the course of your employment, please send an email with the subject line “California Former Employee Data Request” to [privacy@snapfish.com.](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com)

In 2023, Snapfish received and completed 14,194 verified deletion requests and 94 verified access requests from residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia. Snapfish received and completed 159,956 verified requests to opt-out of sale/sharing from residents of these same states. Snapfish received 0 requests to correct as customers can correct their data within their accounts. Snapfish received 0 requests to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information because we do not collect sensitive personal information. Snapfish did not deny any verified requests. Snapfish responded to data subject rights requests within 6 days on average.

We may offer various financial incentives and benefits (such as free shipping, discounts, and other special offers) to customers who interact with us in our Sites and Apps and provide personal information. We offer such financial incentives and benefits for business purposes such as increasing engagement and sales or raising brand awareness, and participation is voluntary. We do not assign monetary or other value to personal information, but the value of such personal information is reasonably related to the estimated value of the financial incentive offered when the information was collected. Snapfish reserves the right to withdraw or modify the financial incentives we offer at any time.

**Supplemental Notice to Residents of Nevada**

Nevada law gives Nevada consumers the right to request that a company not sell their personal information for monetary consideration to certain other parties. This right applies even if their personal information is not currently being sold. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to exercise this right, please click on the Do Not Sell or Share link in the footer of Snapfish webpages, or send an email with the subject line “Nevada Resident Do Not Sell Request” to [privacy@snapfish.com](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com).

**Supplemental (GDPR) Notice to Residents of the EEA, Switzerland, and United Kingdom**

**Controller of Personal Information**

The data controller for your personal information is Snapfish, LLC, located at 10 S. Almaden Boulevard, San Jose, CA 95113, United States of America. Please feel free to contact us for any reason at [privacy@snapfish.com](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com).

**Legal Bases for How We Process Your Information**

The legal bases for processing your information as set out in this Privacy Notice are as follows:

* Where use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you (for example, to comply with the terms of service of our websites which you accept by browsing the websites/registering, and/or our contract to provide our Services to you);
* Where use of your information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to provide security for our websites, products, software, or applications; operate our business and our Services; for direct marketing purposes, as appropriate; to make and receive payments; to engage in employment relationships; to comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; and to prevent fraud);
* Where we have your consent, in accordance with applicable legal requirements, to use your information for a particular purpose; which consent you may withdraw at any time by contacting us; or
* Where we use your information to comply with applicable legal obligations (for example, keeping track of purchases for tax and auditing purposes).

**Integrity and Retention of Personal Information**

Snapfish makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice and our Sites and Apps specific privacy summaries. When assessing these periods, we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need, we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.

**International Data Transfers**

Snapfish servers are in the United States. If you choose to provide us with your information as described in this Privacy Notice, Snapfish may transfer your personal information cross-border. For example, Snapfish may transfer your information to affiliates, partners, or other third parties located outside of your home country, for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. The laws governing data collection and use in the United States may differ and not provide the same level of protection as the jurisdiction in which you reside.

Where we transfer data from the EU, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, Snapfish will implement appropriate safeguards to comply with applicable law in relation to the transfer including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other measures that comply with applicable law, for personal data that is being transferred to places where the EU, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom have determined that an adequate level of protection is not guaranteed.

By providing us with your information, you acknowledge such transfers. If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based. If you would like further information about these transfer mechanisms, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@snapfish.com](mailto:privacy@snapfish.com)

**Your Legal Rights**

Your local laws may permit you to request that we:

* Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you;
* Update or rectify information which is out of date or incorrect;
* Delete certain information that we are holding about you;
* Transfer your information to a third-party provider of services; and/or
* Revoke your consent for the processing of your information, to the extent we rely on consent as the legal basis to process your information; and
* For French residents only, you have the right to give directives relating to the disposal of your information after your death.

You may edit, cancel, or delete your Snapfish account information at any time by entering your login credentials using the self-service tools available. For any other request please contact our [Customer Support](https://support.snapfish.com/hc/en-us). If you request your account to be cancelled or deleted, we will satisfy your request within 30 days. If we require more time to process your request, we will notify you about the delay.

Information necessary for the purposes of maintaining business records regarding a deleted or cancelled account, including records of credit transactions and account ownership, will be retained in accordance with applicable law. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, would jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. We may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes.

**Your Photos**

**Does Snapfish use my photos in advertisements?**

No, Snapfish does not use your photos in our advertisements. Photos you upload to Snapfish may be incorporated into product recommendations that appear on your Snapfish homepage or in communications we send to you, but these photos aren’t used in public advertising, and only you will receive customized product recommendations made using your photos. You may opt out of receiving such communications from us and change your contact preferences within your account at any time.

**Does Snapfish collect information from my photos and projects? If so, how do you use it?**

* _**What we collect.**_ When you upload your photos to our platform or give us permission to access the photos stored on your device, your photo content may also include related image information such as the time and the general location your photo was taken and similar “metadata” captured by your image capture device. If you wish to restrict the capture of image metadata in your individual photos, please adjust the settings on your image capture device.
* _**How we use it.**_ We may analyze your photo content and metadata to help you tag and organize your photos, to create products, to make personalized product suggestions and recommendations to you (such as showing you how your pictures may look in a collage or other Snapfish product), and to send you reminders and suggestions based on the information you include in your projects (such as birthdays and anniversaries).

**How long does Snapfish keep my photos? What are my options?**

If you have a Snapfish account, you control how long it remains active. Snapfish will retain your photos for as long as you maintain an account with us. You also have the ability to download and/or delete some or all of the photos in your account at any time. If you delete Snapfish photos from your account, they will be removed from your Snapfish app and web interface, and we will permanently delete them from our system in the regular course of business.
