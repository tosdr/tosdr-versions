TERMS AND CONDITIONS OVERLAY

Last Updated: November 19, 2024

Welcome to Snapfish! Snapfish provides you with a fun, safe, and easy way to process, print, digitize, store, share and otherwise use (collectively "Process") photographs and other content offered to you on our website. Before you use or access our services, you must carefully review the Terms and Conditions set out below (the "Terms"). Specific pages on our website or mobile application (the “Services”) may set out additional terms and conditions, all of which are incorporated by reference into these Terms. We may be change or update these Terms at any time in accordance with Section XVII, but you can always find the most recent version [here](https://www.snapfish.com/tac-overlay). You should periodically check this page to make sure you have read the current version of these Terms.

Your use of the Services indicates your acceptance of these Terms and agreement to be bound by them. Acceptance of these Terms creates a binding contract between you and Snapfish whereby you agree to use the Services only in accordance with these Terms. If you have questions about these Terms, please contact [Customer Support](https://support.snapfish.com/hc/en-us). Your use of the Services is entirely conditioned on and subject to your compliance with these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not access or use the Services.

Please read and carefully review these Terms, as they form a legally binding agreement between you and Snapfish. You should pay special attention to the arbitration provision set forth below which, except and to the extent prohibited by law, requires you to arbitrate any claims you may have against Snapfish on an individual basis. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.

###### I. Your Account

The Services are intended for adults. This means you must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. You can create a Snapfish account if you are at least 18 years old and submit certain requested information to Snapfish, including your name and correct email address. As a customer, you must provide Snapfish with true, accurate, and complete information about yourself when requested (whether by questionnaires, surveys, registration forms, or other informational requests), and must keep that information updated so it is current and accurate. You are responsible for preserving the confidentiality of your account and password, for restricting access to your account, and for all activities that occur under your account or password. You will immediately notify Snapfish of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your account.

Your Snapfish account credentials will work across all Snapfish websites. However, while the majority of your data is accessible in your account across all websites, certain information, such as your projects and order history, may not be accessible because our service providers and product offerings vary between regions, and a project you start in one region may not be available for purchase in another. When you switch between regions for the first time, you will be given an opportunity to provide certain consents, as appropriate, for that region.

**For French residents only,** if you provide your phone number, you have the right to object to being contacted by phone for direct marketing purposes at any time, by registering free of charge on [www.bloctel.gouv.fr](http://www.bloctel.gouv.fr/).

You can recover Deleted Projects for thirty (30) days after you delete them. After thirty (30) days, Deleted Projects cannot be recovered.

Snapfish may remove Saved Projects from your account if they have not been modified in 365 days, without prior notice to you. Saved Projects removed by Snapfish cannot be recovered.

Snapfish provides the legal warranty of conformity as set forth in articles L. 217-4 et seq. of the French Consumer Code and the legal warranty against latent defects as set forth in articles 1641 to 1648 and 2232 of the French Civil Code.

As regards the warranty of conformity, you have a period of two years from the delivery of the product within which to act.

This legal warranty of conformity is applicable irrespective of the commercial guarantee which may have been granted. Please note that Snapfish does not grant any commercial guarantee. In addition, you may implement the warranty against hidden defects of the product sold within the meaning of article 1641 of the French Civil Code. In this case, you can elect between the sale being canceled or the sale price being reduced pursuant to article 1644 of the French Civil Code.

Except where and to the extent prohibited by law, by using the Services you and Snapfish agree that if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Services, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of these Terms or any part of them, other than disputes related to or involving Snapfish’s intellectual property, (“Dispute”), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party seven (7) days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.

Notice shall be sent to:
