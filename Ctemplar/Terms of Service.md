Terms & Conditions
==================

### **1\. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS**

Welcome to www.ctemplar.com (“Service” or “Site”) owned and operated by CTemplar. By clicking “I Agree” on the account registration or payment page or using the Site in any way, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and all rules, policies, and disclaimers posted on the Site or about which you are notified (collectively “Terms”). If you do not agree with all the Terms, or if you are under the age of eighteen (18), do not use the Site. Please review all of the Terms carefully before using the Site.

By using the Site, you (i) agree to be bound by the Terms, (ii) represent that you are over the age of eighteen (18) and able to form legally binding contracts, (iii) agree and acknowledge that by using the Service you are accepting a benefit that cannot be disgorged, (iv) represent that you are neither located in a sanctioned country nor a prohibited person.

Please note that these terms provide that if you and CTemplar are unable to resolve any disputes that arise between you and CTemplar and the dispute is not resolved informally or through mediation, the dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You and CTemplar also agree that any claims or disputes cannot be brought as a class action. Please carefully review the dispute resolution section below. If you do not accept the arbitration provision then you may not use the site.

### **2\. CTEMPLAR’S RIGHT TO MODIFY TERMS**

CTemplar may modify any of the Terms at any time by posting them on the Site. Such posting shall constitute proper Notice. Changes shall automatically be effective upon posting; provided, however, that those changes that CTemplar, in its sole discretion, deems material changes to the Terms will be effective as to an existing User upon the earlier of: (1) the agreement of the User; or (2) thirty (30) days after notice to the existing User, either via email from a @ctemplar.com email address to the User’s email address on file with CTemplar or via other means including but not limited to a pop-up or banner, message or other conspicuous notice on the Site. If you affirmatively agree to the new terms, your agreement will be effective immediately. You agree to make any and all necessary arrangements so that you (and not your spam filter) receive all emails from CTemplar’s email addresses. Your use of the Service post-notification will signify your acceptance of the changes. If you do not accept the changes, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Site. The latest Terms will be posted on the Site, and you should always review them prior to using the Site.

### **3. MEMBERSHIP AND SECURITY**

You must be a member to use our services. To become a member you must complete our registration process, which requires the selection of a user name and password. You agree to keep your password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. We use “[Zero-Knowledge Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_password_proof)” technology so we do not know your password and we are not capable of accessing your decrypted data. You are solely responsible for the security of your computer system. CTemplar will not be liable for any loss that you may incur if someone else is using your account either with or without your knowledge.  You may not use anyone else’s account without the permission of the account holder. You agree that CTemplar has no responsibility or liability for the deletion, corruption, or failure to store any messages or other content maintained or transmitted by any CTemplar service.

### **4\. YOUR LICENSE TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICES AND OWNERSHIP**

The content, information, software, designs, materials, functions, and data included in and contained on the Services (the “Content”) are protected by intellectual property and other laws. You must comply with these and any other applicable laws when you use the Services.

You may not use the Services in a way that could harm us or any third-party. For example, you may not use the Services in a way that could:

* Damage or interfere with the proper working of the Services
* Use our platform for anything related to child abuse
* Use our service to distribute spam, viruses, or for bulk emailing. We include this because it’s important for the continued functioning of our service.
* Do anything that could suggest falsely a relationship between us and any other party, or otherwise adversely impact the operation of the Services or company.

If one or more of these is violated we may limit or terminate your license to use the services or certain features of the Services, at any time, and for any reason, without prior notice to you including our belief you violated these Terms.

### **5\. TERM OF CONTRACT, RENEWAL, AND TERMINATION OF SERVICES**

Unless indicated to the contrary in the respective Service description, the Agreement is effective for an indefinite time. The Agreement may be terminated by either party with a notice period of one month to the end of each billing cycle. If the contract is not terminated, the contract is automatically renewed with the same billing cycle.

This does not affect the right of CTemplar to terminate the Service at-will.

The termination of additional options, particularly additional accounts or storage space, of the respective tariff leaves the general contract unaffected.

After termination of the contract, CTemplar is no longer obligated to provide the contractual services.

### **6\. AVAILABILITY OF SERVICE**

We will make reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that our web site and our services are available 24 hours per day without any interruptions. However, we may make our web site and/or our services unavailable at any time or restrict access to parts or all of our web site. For example, if we need to update or change our servers.

### **7\. PAYMENT**

Terms of any sale will be posted by CTemplar and agreed to by you before any sale is consummated. We accept a variety of payment options. We may permanently close an account if a stolen credit card or identity was used to purchase the Service. CTemplar does not record or store your payment information, a 3rd party payment processor is used. Anonymous payment may be made through bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.

### **8\. DELIVERY**

Premium service form will be delivered immediately after the payment is confirmed.

### **9\. REFUNDS**

You are entitled to a full refund for any paid email-accounts during a 14 day cooling-off period after the payment.
