Special Notice from BBB AUTO LINE
---------------------------------

BBB National Programs operates BBB AUTO LINE, a dispute resolution program that assists consumers in certain U.S. states with resolving car warranty complaints against participating automobile manufacturers. BBB AUTO LINE only uses collected personal information for purposes of resolving warranty complaints and as required by law. For example, BBB AUTO LINE may be required to provide access to consumer case files to an independent compliance auditor for purposes of confirming BBB AUTO LINE compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

##### **For BBB AUTO LINE consumers:**

**What information do we collect?** BBB AUTO LINE collects personal data when you submit a claim via our online claim form, phone, mail or fax, and during subsequent interactions with our staff while processing your claim for resolution. Specifically, BBB AUTO LINE may collect your name, phone number, fax number, email address, mailing address, and applicable vehicle information such as your sales/lease agreement, vehicle registration, and repair orders. 

**Please do not send any additional personal information unless specifically requested.** BBB AUTO LINE will never request your Social Security Number or other sensitive financial information unrelated to your vehicle’s purchase or lease (e.g., bank account numbers). For your security, please redact or black out any such information from the documents you are submitting.

**What do we do with your information?** This information will be entered into your claim file and available on associated BBB AUTO LINE online platforms. Any other information you submit to BBB AUTO LINE through your online consumer account, over the phone, or via fax or mail will also be saved in your claim file.  The information you provide will only be used for the purpose of resolving your claim. Information about your complaint, in aggregate form, may also be used for federal and state regulatory reporting and statistics regarding BBB AUTO LINE.

**Who else will see your information?** The information you provide for your claim file may be shared with the automobile manufacturer mentioned in your warranty dispute. If your claim requires arbitration, the information may also be shared with a local BBB and arbitrator. If your claim requires consultation with a Technical Expert (TE), we may share your contact information and vehicle information including repair history to enable the TE to conduct an inspection and prepare a report of findings. TEs are contractually obligated to use your contact information only for purposes of performing their services as a TE.

##### **For BBB AUTO LINE attorneys:**

If relevant, BBB AUTO LINE will collect information about individual attorneys representing consumers. This information includes name, firm name, attorney ID, and contact information. This information is associated with the attorney’s username on the BBB AUTO LINE online portal and is used only for the purpose of resolving disputes with which the attorney is involved.

##### **For BBB AUTO LINE arbitrators:**

As described in section 1(e) above, BBB AUTO LINE will collect information about arbitrators who are contracted to resolve disputes within the BBB AUTO LINE program. In addition to name and contact information, BBB AUTO LINE collects information on the arbitrator’s biography and qualifications, including employment history, training history, and language proficiency. This information will be used solely for contacting the arbitrator with regard to pending or possible arbitrations.

Special Notice to Individuals in the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BBB National Programs operates the Global Privacy Division, which includes programs that provide dispute resolution services to individual consumers and data subjects around the world. This includes BBB National Programs Data Privacy Framework Services program ("DPF Services"), an independent recourse mechanism ("IRM") supporting the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, “DPF”). DPF Services handles privacy complaints from individuals in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Switzerland (“collectively, European Complainants”) regarding their personal data transferred to the United States pursuant to DPF and processed by U.S. organizations that have designated DPF Services as their IRM ("Participating Businesses").

##### **Information we collect about European Complainants**

BBB National Programs collects personal data when you submit a privacy complaint using our online complaint form, and during any subsequent contacts you have with our staff by electronic mail or telephone in relation to your DPF complaint. Except as otherwise indicated below, DPF Services does not collect personally identifiable information or personal data unless you voluntarily provide it to us, and limits the personal data it collects to information relevant for the purposes of processing. Types of personal data we collect include your name, full address, phone number, and email address, as well as documents and other information you may provide to us to authenticate your identity or substantiate your complaint. In the course of handling your complaint, we may also collect information about you from the Participating Business against which you filed your complaint.

##### **How DPF Services Uses Your Personal Data**

DPF Services may process your Personal Data for the following purposes:

* Effective complaint handling, including verifying your identity and location; making eligibility determinations; and facilitating communications between you and DPF Services, and between DPF Services and the participating business that is a party to your case, as well as any independent Panelist conducting a Data Privacy Review of your complaint, in the conduct of the case.
* Preparing and publishing reports as required under DPF or by the DPF Services Procedure Rules.
* Providing information you may request about the services of DPF Services, and answering your questions.
* Investigating and processing suspected violations of DPF Services' Procedure Rules.
* Complying with DPF Services obligations as an IRM under DPF, including (i) provision of complaint data to the appropriate governmental authorities and (ii) complying with applicable data retention obligations.

When DPF Services transmits complaint-related information over the internet, we protect it through the use of data encryption methods.

##### **Bases for Processing**

To process the personal data of DPF Services complainants as described above, BBB National Programs relies on the following independent legal bases: DPF Services carries out tasks in the public interest; processing is necessary for DPF Services' legitimate interests; and DPF Services receives complainants' express consent to process their personal data in the United States.

Public Interest. BBB National Programs is a not-for-profit organization that operates numerous widely recognized self-regulatory and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) programs in North America, including DPF Services. The alternative dispute resolution programs of organizations such as BBB National Programs are sanctioned by the laws of many countries, most of which acknowledge the importance of ADR's role as an important channel in the administration of justice. The personal data collected by DPF Services in processing privacy complaints from EU and EEA individuals is essential to DPF Services' performance of its dispute resolution function under DPF, which constitutes "a task in the public interest" as a basis for collecting and maintaining such information under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Legitimate interests. Personal data related to complainants is collected only to the extent necessary given DPF Services' legitimate interests as a data controller, in its role as an IRM providing dispute resolution services to individuals in the EU/EEA with privacy complaints against U.S. businesses participating in the DPF that have identified DPF Services as their IRM.

Consent. Before completing the DPF Services online complaint form, DPF Services requests your express consent to our processing of your personal data in the United States. If you withdraw your consent to processing before we make an eligibility determination regarding your complaint and open a case, we will discontinue your complaint and delete your information. After a case has been opened, DPF Services may proceed with processing on the alternative legal bases set forth above, or where legally obligated to do so.

##### **Sharing Your Personal Data with Third Parties**

DPF Services may share your Personal Data with (i) a DPF Services Participating Business against which you have submitted a complaint, in order to process the complaint; (ii) independent Data Privacy Panelists we may assign to arbitrate your complaint, should you request a Data Privacy Review; and (iii) BBB National Programs' service providers, including data processors, in order to deliver the services provided by DPF Services.

##### **Data Retention**

DPF Services will store your Personal Data for as long as necessary to perform the purposes of processing, which include handling your complaint to its final resolution; producing required reports pursuant to DPF and to the DPF Services Procedure Rules; and otherwise complying with our legal and regulatory obligations.

##### **Data Subject Rights for EU/EEA Individuals**

Subject to some limits, individuals in the EU and EEA countries have a number of rights regarding personal data collected by BBB National Programs in the course of DPF Services complaint handling:

* **Right of access and portability.** The right to obtain access to your personal information, along with certain related information, and to receive that information in a commonly used format and to have it transferred to another data controller;
* **Right to rectification.** The right to obtain rectification of your personal information without undue delay where that personal information is inaccurate or incomplete;
* **Right to erasure.** The right to obtain the erasure of your personal information without undue delay in certain circumstances, such as where the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed;
* **Right to restriction.** The right to obtain the restriction of the processing undertaken by us on your personal information in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of the personal information is contested by you, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of that personal information; or where BBB National Programs no longer needs to retain the personal data, but you would like us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
* **Right to object.** The right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal information.

If you need further assistance regarding the above rights, please contact us at [privacy@BBBNP.org](mailto:privacy@BBBNP.org) and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law.

In some cases, our ability to uphold one or more of these rights for you may be limited, in light of BBB National Programs' role as a private organization providing ADR services through DPF Services in the public interest, or for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.

European Union and EEA individuals also have the right to lodge a privacy complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority.
