Material may be made available on the Sites by third parties not within our control. We are under no obligation to, and do not, scan material used in connection with the Sites for the inclusion of illegal or impermissible Content. However, we respect the copyright interests of others. It is our policy not to permit material known by us to infringe upon another party's copyright to remain on the Sites.

To notify BBB NP of alleged copyright or trademark infringement on the Site, in accordance with 17 U.S.C. §512(C)(3), you should provide us with written notice that at a minimum contains:

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
* Identification of the copyrighted work that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit BBB NP to locate the material;
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit BBB NP to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
* A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

All Notifications of Claimed Copyright Infringement should be sent to our designated agent as follows: 

Upon receipt of the above information, BBB NP will promptly investigate and take appropriate action, then notify you of that action at the contact address provided.

**6.   COMPLIANCE**

You expressly agree that the Sites may only be used for lawful purposes as governed by any applicable international, national/federal, state, provincial or local laws, statutes, and regulations. You may not use the Sites in any way that could result in criminal or civil liability. Use of the Sites from outside of the United States shall be in compliance with the laws of the jurisdiction from which you access the Site.

**7.   LINKS**

Inbound Links

BBB National Programs, Inc. (BBB NP) welcomes the opportunity for third parties to link to Sites so long as the links are used in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Third parties may link to our homepage, publications, educational or consumer information, and/ or to other website information so long as the link:

(a) is not in any way misleading;

(b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval of the linking party and its products, services or membership;

(c)  appears without the use of any confusingly similar logo or border around the content;

(d)  correctly uses the name “BBB National Programs, Inc.”;

(e) uses the uniform resource locator (“URL”) being linked to or any other description of the BBB NP website or material being linked to that makes sense within the context and format of content on the linking party’s site; and

(f) does not reflect unfavorably on BBB NP (organizations representing inherently suspect types of businesses, such as work-at-home opportunities are considered unfavorable and shall not be allowed to link).

No use of the BBB torch logo or other design mark of BBB NP or the International Association of Better Business Bureaus (IABBB) may be allowed for linking, absent a trademark license agreement between the parties and express permission from IABBB and BBB NP.

Outbound Links

From time to time, BBB NP may, with permission from the site owner, decide to link to websites that we determine may be of interest to our visitors. These websites may offer educational, governmental, or other resources or may be owned or controlled by other third parties.

BBB NP is not responsible for the content of any linked site, any link(s) contained in any linked site, or any changes or updates to the information contained in such sites. We provide links to third party sites only as a convenience and the inclusion of any such link on our site does not imply our endorsement of either the site, the organization operating such site, or any products or services of that organization. A visit to any site or page from our website via any such link is done entirely at your own risk.

We strongly recommend reading any Standard Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, Disclaimers, or other notifications that may be found on any such third party websites. Under no circumstances will we be held responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage that is caused or alleged to have been caused in connection with the use of, or reliance on, any content, goods or services available on any other site.

**8.   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY**

BBB NP DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, TIMELINESS, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THE SITES AND DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE SITES. THE SITES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BBB NP DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SITES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THOSE WARRANTIES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION, OR MODIFICATION UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT.

ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITES IS ACQUIRED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR OWN COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.

**9.   INDEMNIFICATION**

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless BBB NP and its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, independent contractors, or licensors (collectively the "BBB NP Parties") from and against any and all claims, losses, expenses, demands or liabilities, including attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by the BBB NP Parties in connection with any claim by a third party (including any intellectual property claim) arising out of (i) your use of the Sites and any material you access using the Sites or by any other means; (ii) a third party's use of such material that you access using the Sites and make available to such third party; or (iii) your violation of this Agreement or any applicable law. You further agree that you will cooperate fully in the defense of any such claims. BBB NP reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you shall not in any event settle any such claim or matter without the written consent of the relevant BBB NP Parties.

**10.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

Under no circumstances shall BBB NP be liable to you or any other party for any direct, indirect, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for lost profits, business interruption, goodwill, or other intangible losses of any kind arising from or relating in any way to (i) your use of, or inability to use, the Sites or the information contained in the Sites; (ii) any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus or line, or system failure; and (iii) any other matter relating to the Sites, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

BBB NP may immediately suspend access to the Sites and remove and discard any Content you submitted to the Sites for any reason if BBB NP believes you have violated or acted inconsistently with the terms of this Agreement. Termination of your access to the Sites may be effected without prior notice. BBB NP will not be liable to you or any third-party for termination of your access to the Sites. 

**12.   RELATIONSHIP**

Your use of the Sites does not create, and nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to establish, an employment, agency, franchise, joint venture, or partnership relationship between you and BBB NP. Use of the Sites does not provide you with the authority to enter into any agreements for or on behalf of BBB NP. Moreover, use of the Sites does not grant you the authority, either express or implied, to incur obligations or liability on behalf of BBB NP. By using the Sites, you agree that no attempts to subject BBB NP to any such obligations or liability will be made.  

**13.   WAIVER**

Failure by BBB NP to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of those rights or any other rights in any way whatsoever.

You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the City and County of Arlington, Virginia, U.S.A.

**15.   OTHER AGREEMENTS**

This Agreement shall be subject to any other agreements you have entered into with BBB NP. If any such agreements conflict with the terms of the instant Agreement, the other agreements shall control.

Certain sections or pages on the Sites may contain separate terms and conditions of use, which are in addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Should there be a conflict, the additional terms and conditions will govern for those sections or pages.

**17.   SEVERABILITY**

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent possible, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

**18.   MODIFICATION**

BBB NP reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time, with or without notice to you.  Thus, you should check the Agreement periodically for changes. You agree that BBB NP will not be liable to you or any third party for any modifications to the Agreement.

**19.   SECTION HEADINGS**

The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation.

**20.   EFFECT**

This Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assignees.
