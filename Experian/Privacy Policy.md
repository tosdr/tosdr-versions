Experian Global Data Principles
-------------------------------

Our five Global Data Principles embody these key values (see below). They guide how we manage and use data, build products and conduct our business around the world. These principles apply to all our data, in all our businesses, and in every country. We developed the principles to better reflect our commitments to individuals, businesses, clients, and the public, which have advanced as market demands and expectations have evolved.

[Learn more](https://www.experianplc.com/responsibility/treating-data-with-respect)

### Security

Data security is critical. Securing and protecting data against unauthorised access, use, disclosure, and loss are key priorities for us.

### Accuracy

We will make data as accurate, complete, and relevant as possible for the manner in which it is used, always in compliance with legal requirements.

### Fairness

We collect and use data fairly and for legitimate purposes, balancing privacy expectations with the social and economic benefits derived from the responsible use of data for individuals, businesses and clients.

### Transparency

We are open and transparent about the types of data we collect, where we get it, how it is used and where it is shared. Where appropriate we provide individuals with access to the data we collect about them and the ability to correct, restrict or delete data.

### Inclusion

We seek to improve financial health and inclusion for all through the innovative use of relevant data to help individuals improve their financial lives.

Approach to Privacy
-------------------

Experian® considers itself a steward of the information it collects, maintains and utilizes. Our responsibility is to ensure the security of the information in our care and to maintain the privacy of consumers through appropriate, responsible use.  
  
We provide services based on information about millions of individuals and businesses. Use of that data is guided by our Global Data Principles. Our Global Data Principles embody our key values and are used as a framework to guide how we manage and use data, build products and conduct our business around the world.

Data policies, built on our principles, more specifically define how that information may be used. The policies vary to meet the legal requirements and consumer expectations in the area in which the information product or service is being used.  
  
Underlying these policies is Experian's commitment to provide consumers notice, choice and education about the use of personal information. Educated consumers are better equipped to be effective, successful participants in a world that increasingly relies on the exchange of information to efficiently deliver the products and services consumers demand.  
  
Today, our business clients' needs, and consumers' expectations are constantly changing, and technology is constantly evolving. Our approach to privacy, rooted in the Global Data Principles, enables Experian to respond to those constantly changing needs and expectations and provides the flexibility to implement new processes and policies to resolve information issues in this dynamic environment.
