We provide services based on information about millions of individuals and businesses. Use of that data is guided by our Global Data Principles. Our Global Data Principles embody our key values and are used as a framework to guide how we manage and use data, build products and conduct our business around the world.

Data policies, built on our principles, more specifically define how that information may be used. The policies vary to meet the legal requirements and consumer expectations in the area in which the information product or service is being used.  
  
Underlying these policies is Experian's commitment to provide consumers notice, choice and education about the use of personal information. Educated consumers are better equipped to be effective, successful participants in a world that increasingly relies on the exchange of information to efficiently deliver the products and services consumers demand.  
  
Today, our business clients' needs, and consumers' expectations are constantly changing, and technology is constantly evolving. Our approach to privacy, rooted in the Global Data Principles, enables Experian to respond to those constantly changing needs and expectations and provides the flexibility to implement new processes and policies to resolve information issues in this dynamic environment.
