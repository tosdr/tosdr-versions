### Terms and Conditions

#### 1\. General - Scope of application

1.1 The following Terms and Conditions apply to all business relationships between the Customer and Hetzner Online GmbH, also hereinafter referred to as "us/we". These Terms and Conditions are an integral part of all contracts with the Customer. These Terms and Conditions also apply to future services and offers, even if the Customer does not separately agree upon them again.

1.2. The terms and conditions of our customers or third parties are not applicable and are not part of the contract, even if we do not separately object to their application in individual cases.

1.3 We expressly reserve the right to make changes to our Terms and Conditions, System Policies and prices by giving the Customer prior notification via their customer account or using the email address the Customer enters in their contact information.

1.4. The conditions and policies listed in the preamble apply in the order of precedence listed above.

1.5. Our employees and third parties commissioned by them are not authorized to make verbal agreements or to provide any verbal guarantees or commitments to the Customer.

1.6. If domains are the subject of this contract, the corresponding terms and conditions also apply, which are available at [https://www.hetzner.com/legal/allocating-terms](https://www.hetzner.com/legal/allocating-terms)

#### 2\. Conclusion, duration and termination of the contract

2.1. The contract is concluded when the Customer submits their order and we accept their order in accordance to the provisions of point 2.4 of these Terms and Conditions.

2.2. Our offers are subject to change and are non-binding. We reserve the right to make technical and other changes within the scope of what is reasonable.

2.3. The Customer declares that the data they provided on their customer account are correct and complete and shall notify us of any changes in this regard in writing within no more than 14 days. The Customer is required to provide evidence of the correctness of the data upon request.

2.4. The Customer enters into a binding contract by placing the order and by accepting these Terms and Conditions. We are entitled to accept or reject the contract in the Customer’s order within a period of 5 work days after we receive the order. By merely confirming that we have received the Customer’s order, we are not bound to accept their order and the contract it contains.

2.5. Contracts are concluded for an unlimited time period unless otherwise agreed.

2.6. The contract may be terminated by either party with 30 days' notice to the end of the month, without specifying any reasons. Differing periods of notice may apply to the Customers depending on the description of relevant services. Notice of termination may be given in text form by letter, fax, email or via the Customer’s account on our secure customer interface.

2.7. Furthermore, we reserve the right to terminate the contractual relationship without notice for good cause. Such good cause is deemed to exist, among other reasons, if the Customer fails to meet its payment obligations or violates other important customer obligations. A further important reason which may result in us locking or terminating the Customer’s services or account without notice is if the Customer uses content that impairs the regular operating behavior or the security of our infrastructure or our product, or violates paragraphs 8.1. - 8.3. of these Terms and Conditions.

2.8. If the Customer intends to transfer their contractual rights and obligations to a third party, then our consent is required for this purpose. The Customer must make their transfer request in writing. We are obligated to verify the legitimacy of the transferor and the identity of the third party.

#### 3\. Scope of services

3.1. The scope of the contractual service is based on the product description that is valid at the time of the Customer’s order and the written agreements resulting from it. We reserve the right, after prior notice, to discontinue services we offer free of charge or to introduce fees for these services.

3.2. If the subject of the contractual relationship is the registration of domain names, we only are obligated to arrange the desired domain registration. We do not accept liability for or provide any warranty that the domain registration authorities will actually allocate the domain name that the Customer requests in their order. The Customer is only entitled to assume they will actually be allocated the domain name once we have confirmed the allocation. We have no influence on the domain allocation.

3.3. We undertake to make economically reasonable efforts to achieve an annual average network availability of 99.9% at our data centers.

3.4. Restrictions apply as described under [https://www.hetzner.com/legal/system-policies](https://www.hetzner.com/legal/system-policies).

3.5. If the service includes the allocation of an IP address, we do not perform a blacklist check of this IP address and the Customer has no claim to a specific IP address. We reserve the right to change the Customer’s allocated IP address when necessary with prior written notice.

3.6. If we offer technical support services that go beyond the service description, then we invoice these separately.

#### 4\. Payment conditions and late payments

4.1. We will invoice the Customer for any contractually binding services using the updated prices visible on www.hetzner.com, plus the statutory value added tax. If the service is for shipped goods, the price includes postage and packaging from the specified storage location.

4.2. Depending on the contractual agreement, we process monthly, quarterly or annual invoices using the agreed means of payment. The Customer is obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of the payment service they use to pay their invoice.

4.3. If we permit the Customer to make a late payment, we maintain the right, even without a reminder, to charge interest for the late payment beginning on the due date. The amount is determined in accordance with paragraph § 288 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

4.4. The Customer is obligated to pay all fees and taxes incurred by using the service or by the third parties designated by the Customer. Billing is free of charge exclusively in electronic form. There are corresponding fees for postal delivery.

4.5. The Customer is obligated to comply with any applicable export and import control regulation, in particular the US regulations as well as all other relevant regulations.

#### 5\. Administrator rights and duties / data security

5.1. The Customer has full and sole administrator rights for all root and cloud server service products. The Customer is responsible for managing and securing these products at their own expense and risk.

5.2. The Customer, by using our services, is obligated to set up and manage their servers in such a way that does not compromise the integrity and availability of the networks, servers and data of third parties. In particular, it is strictly forbidden to use the servers for (d)DOS attacks or to run open mail relays or other systems that are capable of performing these actions. If the Customer violates this agreement, we reserve the right - without prior notice - to lock the server and terminate the contract without notice.

5.3. For the managed server products and services, we grant the Customer only basic usage rights. We monitor these servers 24 hours a day for service disruptions and provide customer support free of charge for simple services. For more extensive services lasting 15 minutes or more, we charge a flat service fee that is subject to prior agreement with the Customer.

5.4. The Customer is obligated to use the services provided appropriately and to refrain from abusive and illegal actions.

5.5. The Customer is responsible for making regular backups (backup copies) of their data; the backups should be stored outside the server provided by us. If data is transmitted to us on the Customer’s servers, the Customer is obligated to make regular backup copies of the data. The customer is obligated to perform a complete data backup prior to any change they make on their own behalf or on the behalf of a third party. If there is nonetheless a loss of data, the Customer is obligated to transfer the relevant data files to us again free of charge or to restore the data themselves.

#### 6\. Data protection

6.1. Data processing is performed in accordance with GDPR. Please refer to our privacy policy for more information, which is available under [https://www.hetzner.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.hetzner.com/legal/privacy-policy)

6.2. If the Customer also wishes to process personal data of third parties with our services, the Customer alone remains the responsible party in the sense of data protection law. We only process personal data as a processor of orders pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR if the Customer concludes a contract for processing orders with us. This contract for processing orders is not concluded automatically. We can offer the Customer the opportunity to conclude a contract for processing orders via the Customer’s account, if necessary, which is supplemented by EU standard contractual clauses, if the Customer orders products that are located in a third country.

6.3. We hereby warn the Customer that we are generally unable to determine whether the Customer is processing personal data. The Customer is therefore obligated to provide us with the necessary information, in particular whether personal data of third parties are processed, for what purpose these data are processed and which categories the personal data and the data subjects are to be assigned. In the absence of a contract for order processing with the necessary information from the Customer, we assume that the Customer is not processing third party personal data using our services, so we will not take any measures in accordance with data protection law.

6.4. We hereby warn the Customer that, given the current state of technology, there is still no all-embracing form of protection for data transmission on the internet. The Customer is responsible for the safety and security of all data they store on any of their products.

#### 7\. Use by third parties

7.1. The Customer is entitled to grant third parties a contractual term of use to any services the Customer orders from Hetzner. In this case, the Customer nevertheless remains the sole contractual partner. The Customer continues to be solely and fully liable for compliance with the contractual agreements between us and the Customer.

7.2. If the Customer transfers user rights to their Hetzner services to a third party, the Customer is obligated at the time of transfer to ensure that all legal and contractual provisions are followed. This is true for any changes that require the cooperation of the third party.

7.3. If the third party violates the contractual obligations or does not comply with the obligation to cooperate, if the data provided by the third party is incorrect or incomplete, or if other problems arise with the granting of user rights to third parties, the Customer assumes full liability for all resulting damages and, in addition, indemnifies us from all claims made against us by the third party or others.

#### 8\. Use of the services / content

8.1. The Customer is obligated to check and comply with the legal provisions arising from the use of the contractually agreed services, in particular the Telecommunications Act, the Telemedia Act, as well as national and international industrial and intellectual property rights, personal rights, and the requirements of competition and data protection laws on their own. The Customer indemnifies us against all claims of third parties arising from infringements of these obligations.

8.2. The Customer is obligated not to publish any content that infringes on the rights of third parties or otherwise violates applicable law. This includes in particular, but is not limited to, pornographic or obscene material, extremist content or content that offends common decency, gambling, material that could seriously endanger the morals of children or young people or violate the rights of third parties (copyrights, name rights, trademark rights and data protection rights). This also includes the publication of defamatory content, insults or disparagement of persons or groups of persons.

8.3. The transmission of spam mail is prohibited. This includes in particular the sending of unauthorized, unsolicited advertising to third parties. When sending emails, it is also prohibited to provide false sender data or to disguise the identity of the sender in any other way. The operation of applications for mining cryptocurrencies remains prohibited. These include, but are not limited to, mining, farming and plotting of cryptocurrencies. We are entitled to lock the Customer’s access to their Hetzner services or account in the event of non-compliance.

8.4. If we become aware of illegal activities, we are obligated under § 10 Telemedia Act (TMG) to request that the Customer immediately removes the offending content and we are entitled to lock the Customer’s access to their Hetzner services or account.

#### 9\. Liability

9.1. The Customer uses Hetzner services at their own risk. We are liable for indirect damages in the case of intent or gross negligence, but not for loss of profit. We are liable for culpable infringements that are not due to gross negligence or intent for the foreseeable damage typical for this type of contract, up to a maximum of 100 % of the price for the Customer's monthly product rental.

9.2. If the Customer violates the content obligations mentioned in Section 8 of these Terms and Conditions, in particular regarding legal prohibitions and decency violations, the Customer is liable to us for compensation for all direct or indirect damages arising from this, including financial losses. Furthermore, the Customer is obligated to indemnify us against claims by third parties - irrespective of the legal basis - resulting from the Customer or their designated third parties. The indemnification obligation also includes all incurred legal defense costs.

#### 10\. Warranty

If the service consists of goods delivered via post, a limitation period of 12 months after delivery applies to claims for defects. If the service consists of the delivery of used goods, we are not liable for any defects. The statutory limitation period also applies to claims for damages in the event of willful and gross negligence as well as in the event of injury to life, limb and health that are the result of an intentional or negligent breach of obligation by the user.

#### 11\. Right of lien

The Customer grants us a lien on equipment installed by the Customer or by third parties in the data center to protect any outstanding debts arising from the contractual relationship. We are entitled to enforce the lien after informing the customer of their outstanding debts if the Customer does not settle all outstanding debts within 10 work days after receiving the notification of sale. Any surpluses generated by the sale are paid out to the Customer.

#### 12\. Cancellation policy

12.1. The Customer has the right to cancel this contract within fourteen days after the conclusion of the contract without providing any reasons. To exercise their right to cancel this contract, the Customer is required to notify us, Hetzner Online GmbH, Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, tel.: +49 9831505-0, fax: +49 9831 505-3, email: info@hetzner.com by means of a clear declaration (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax, email or via the Customer’s account on our secure online administration interface) of the Customer’s decision to cancel this contract. The Customer is free to use the cancellation template for this purpose, although it is not mandatory. To meet the cancellation requirements, it is sufficient for the Customer to send a clearly worded notification that they wish to exercise their right of cancellation before the cancellation deadline.

12.2. Cancellation procedure If the Customer cancels this contract, we will immediately or at the latest fourteen days from the date of our receiving the notice of cancellation of this contract, refund all payments we have received from the Customer including delivery charges (with the exception of additional charges arising from the Customer choosing a type of delivery other than our standard low-cost standard delivery). This refund will use the same means of payment that the Customer used in the original transaction, unless we mutually agree otherwise. Under no circumstances is the Customer charged any fees for this refund.  
  
If the cancelled item is a service that has already begun at the time of cancellation, we will invoice the Customer for the corresponding pro rata amount.

12.3. Our cancellation form is available at: [https://www.hetzner.com/legal/withdrawal/](https://www.hetzner.com/legal/withdrawal)

#### 13\. Dispute resolution procedure

The EU Commission provides a platform for out-of-court online dispute resolution (ODR platform), which is available at [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr). We are neither willing nor obligated to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.

#### 14\. Final provisions and severability clause

14.1. These Terms and Conditions and the contractual relationship between us and the Customer are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and international private law.

14.2. The international and exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contractual relationship is our registered office in Gunzenhausen. We are, however, entitled in all cases to initiate legal proceedings at the Customer's place of business. Superordinate statutory provisions, in particular, on exclusive jurisdiction, remain unaffected.

14.3. If any provision is or becomes invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, this has no effect on the validity of the remaining provisions. The same applies if and to the extent that an omission be revealed in this contract. In place of the invalid or unenforceable provision, an appropriate provision will apply which, as far as legally possible, corresponds to the sense and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision or to the presumed intention of the parties, just as if they had considered this point.

We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications.

#### 13\. No Third-Party Beneficiaries / No Extra-Contractual Relationships.

These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you.

The indemnification obligations under this section shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms or your use of the Site or our Services.

#### 19\. U.S. Export Laws.

The Services we provide in the USA are subject to the export laws, restrictions, regulations and administrative acts of the United States Department of Commerce, Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), State Department, and other United States authorities (collectively, “U.S. Export Laws”). You shall not use our Services to collect, store or transmit any technical information or data that is controlled under U.S. Export Laws. You shall not export or re-export, or allow the export or re-export of, our Services in violation of any U.S. Export Laws. None of our Services may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident thereof) any country with which the United States has embargoed trade; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, or any other denied parties lists under U.S. Export Laws. By using the Site and our Services, you agree to the forego, represent and warrant that you are not a national or resident of, located in, or under the control of, any restricted country; and you are not on any denied parties list; and you agree to comply with all U.S. Export Laws (including “anti-boycott”, “deemed export” and “deemed re-export” regulations). If you access the Site or our Services from other countries or jurisdictions, you do so on your own initiative and you are responsible for compliance with the local laws of that jurisdiction, if and to the extent those local laws are applicable and do not conflict with U.S. Export Laws. If such laws conflict with U.S. Export Laws, you shall not access the Site or use our Services. The obligations under this section shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms or your use of the Site our Services.

#### 20\. Availability of Website and Services.

Subject to these Terms and our other policies and procedures, we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to provide the Site and our Services on a twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week basis. You acknowledge and agree that from time to time the Site and our Services may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason including, but not limited to, equipment malfunctions; periodic maintenance, repairs or replacements that we undertake from time to time; or causes beyond our reasonable control or that are not reasonably foreseeable including, but not limited to, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, hostile network attacks, network congestion or other failures. You acknowledge and agree that we have no control over the availability of the Site or Services on a continuous or uninterrupted basis, and that we assume no liability to you or any other party with regard thereto.

#### 21\. Force Majeure.

We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in our performance under these Terms when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, floods, fires, earthquakes, explosions, governmental actions, wars, invasions or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riots or other civil unrest, national emergencies, revolutions, insurrections, epidemics, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to our workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or inability or delays in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, material defects, telecommunication breakdowns or power outages.

#### 22\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.

All matters arising out of or relating to these Terms and the contractual relationship are governed by and construed in accordance with German law without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the law of any jurisdiction – including international jurisdiction - other than German law. Place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from the contractual relationship is our registered office in Gunzenhausen, Germany. However, we are entitled in all cases to take legal action at your place of business. Overriding statutory provisions, in particular, exclusive jurisdiction, shall remain unaffected.

#### 23\. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration.

(a) IN THE EVENT THAT SECTION 22 IS NOT APPLICABLE BY LAW, THE FOLLOWING RULES SHALL APPLY.

(b) YOU AND WE AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES VIA THE SITE WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND CONCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION.

(c) The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Agreement. (The AAA Rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.

The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.

The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver, and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.

If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.

#### 24\. Severability.

If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.

#### 25\. Entire Agreement.

These Terms, any license agreement relating to any product or service you obtain on or via the Site, our System Policies, and any domain name registration agreement you obtain on or via the Site will be deemed the final and integrated Agreement between you and us on the matters contained in these Terms.
