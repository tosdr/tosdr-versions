**ABOUT DATASEAT’S SERVICES.**

Dataseat provides our clients (Typically advertising agencies and App developers who are marketing and promoting their apps to consumers) with a platform to run their own advertising campaigns. They use the Dataseat platform to minimise the risk of their adverts being shown in poor quality inventory. Our aim is to allow our clients to identify people who are likely to be interested in their products and services and to provide the best possible advertising experience for users and for our clients by linking our clients with the users who are interested in their adverts.

With our service, you should see adverts that are more relevant, interesting and engaging giving a positive experience not an intrusive one.

**OUR TECHNOLOGY.**

We receive information containing the advertising ID from mobile applications on Android and iOS smart phones and tablets. Advertising IDs are sent to us by our clients and or their attribution service provider for users that have downloaded and engaged with their App. Our technology is also connected to Advertising exchanges which give our clients the opportunity to buy and serve adverts in other publisher Apps.
