Terms of Use
------------

USE OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED BY MIXPANEL, INC. (‚ÄúMIXPANEL‚Äù) AND REFERENCED HEREIN IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THIS MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT AND ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS REFERENCED HEREIN OR ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE PARTIES (‚ÄúAGREEMENT‚Äù). BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OR BY USING MIXPANEL‚ÄôS APPLICATION SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU AND THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT AND ANY AFFILIATE OF SUCH ENTITY INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, ‚ÄúCUSTOMER‚Äù) AGREE THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND CUSTOMER TO THESE TERMS AND HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY OR DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE MIXPANEL‚ÄôS APPLICATION SERVICES. THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO AS OF THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS OR USE THE APPLICATION SERVICES (‚ÄúEFFECTIVE DATE‚Äù).

### 1\. USE OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES

1.1 Use of Application Services. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Mixpanel grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to access and use the Application Services solely for Customer‚Äôs internal business purposes and not for resale or further distribution. Customer‚Äôs right to access and use the Application Services shall be subject to Customer‚Äôs compliance with the terms and conditions contained herein and limited to the Subscription Plan and the Subscription Term purchased by Customer.

1.2 Authorized Users. Customer may allow Authorized Users to access and use the Application Services; provided Customer shall be responsible for ensuring its Authorized Users use the Application Services in compliance with Customer‚Äôs obligations under this Agreement.

1.3 Subscription Plans.

1.3.1 Subscription Plans. The Application Services are provided through existing and legacy Subscription Plans. For all Subscription Plans: a ‚Äú**Data Point**‚Äù or ‚Äú**Event**‚Äù shall mean a JSON object comprised of an event (string) and a dictionary of properties (object) that is stored by the Application Services; a ‚Äú**User Profile**‚Äù shall mean a JSON object comprised of an identifier or identifying string intended to indicate a unique user and a dictionary of properties (object) that is stored by the Application Services; and a ‚Äú**Monthly Tracked User**‚Äù or ‚Äú**MTU**‚Äù shall mean a unique identifier sent with at least one Data Point to the Application Services in a calendar month.

1.3.2 Free Services. Mixpanel offers free Subscription Plans at no cost that have limited features, functionality, and volume tiers, for specified Subscription Terms. Mixpanel reserves the right to modify the free Subscription Plans at any time in its sole discretion or even discontinue, suspend or terminate them entirely, without prior notice to Customer.

1.3.3 Legacy Services. From time to time Mixpanel may, at its sole discretion, cease to offer certain Subscription Plans (‚Äú**Legacy Subscription Plan**‚Äù). If Customer is on a paid Legacy Subscription Plan, Mixpanel shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior written notice of the deprecation of such Legacy Subscription Plan and related support until the end of Customer‚Äôs then current Subscription Term.

1.4 A La Carte Fees. Usage of the Application Services exceeding the volume tier of the Subscription Plan purchased by Customer will result in Customer being charged additional fees (‚ÄúA La Carte Fees‚Äù), at 150% of the unit price applicable to Customer‚Äôs selected volume tier (unless otherwise provided in an Order Form), and Customer shall be obligated to pay any A La Carte Fees the following month. For Subscription Plans on MTUs, if the number of Data Points/Events or updates to User Profiles sent by Customer to the Application Services in a calendar month is greater than the number equal to the quantity of MTUs sent to the Application Services in such calendar month multiplied by 1,000, each and every additional 1,000 Data Points/Events or updates to User Profiles shall be considered an additional MTU for the purposes of calculating A La Carte Fees.

1.5 Pricing. Mixpanel reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the pricing of its services and Subscription Plans, add new services or pricing plans for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time without prior notice to Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fees set forth on an Order Form shall remain fixed for the duration of the Subscription Term set forth therein and any new pricing, additional fees and/or charges shall become effective at the start of a new Subscription Term, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties.

### 2\. ACCESS TO THE APPLICATION SERVICES

2.1 Restrictions.

Mixpanel may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Mixpanel will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with a Beta Service.

4.5 Customer Content Deletion. Mixpanel provides Customer with access to Customer Content and the ability to delete Customer Content through the Application Services. Upon termination of Mixpanel‚Äôs relationship with Customer, Mixpanel has no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Content and will delete Customer Content unless prohibited by law.

4.6 Security. Mixpanel will maintain appropriate physical, technical and organizational controls designed to safeguard Customer Content within its cloud storage from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. These controls will include measures designed to store Customer Content on servers located in a physically secured location; and the use of firewalls, access controls and similar security technologies designed to protect Customer Content from unauthorized disclosure. Mixpanel takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Customer Content other than its express security obligations in this section and Customer understands and agrees that Mixpanel will not be responsible or liable for any breach or loss of Customer Content resulting from Customer‚Äôs security configuration or administration of the Application Services.

4.7 Customer Security Obligations. Customer agrees that, without limiting Mixpanel‚Äôs obligations under Section 4.6, Customer is solely responsible for its use and configuration of the Application Services, including (i) maintaining appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to maintain a level of security for the Customer Content appropriate to the risk; (ii) securing Customer‚Äôs systems and devices used to access the Application Services; (iii) maintaining its own backups of Customer Content; (iv) decisions not to use privacy or security settings or features available in the Application Services; and (v) choices related to the type of Customer Content (including, if any, Personal Information) transferred to the Application Services through Customer‚Äôs configuration of the Application Services. Without limitation of the foregoing, certain parts of the Application Services, including account management features, may be password-restricted to registered users or other authorized persons (‚Äú**Password-Protected Areas**‚Äù). If Customer is authorized to gain access to any Password-Protected Areas, Customer agrees that Customer is entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Customer‚Äôs password and agrees to notify Mixpanel if the password is lost, stolen, disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. Customer agrees that Customer is entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under Customer‚Äôs account, whether or not Customer undertakes such activities. Customer agrees to immediately notify Mixpanel of any unauthorized use of Customer‚Äôs account or any other breach of security in relation to Customer‚Äôs password or the Application Services that is known to Customer.

4.8 Privacy Statement. Mixpanel‚Äôs tracking and use of information collected about Customer on Mixpanel Sites are governed by the Mixpanel Privacy Statement, available at [https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

The Application Services and Documentation may display, contain links to, or connect with third-party products, services, and websites (collectively, ‚Äú**Third-Party Services**‚Äù). The Application Services allow Customer to import data from and export data to Third-Party Services. By using the Application Services, Customer authorizes Mixpanel to transfer, store, and process Customer Content from and to Customer‚Äôs Third-Party Services accounts on its behalf. Any statements, services, offers, or other information that constitutes part of the Third-Party Services made available by third parties on the Application Services or Mixpanel Sites, or which are accessible through the Application Services are those of the respective authors or producers and not of Mixpanel or its stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, or representatives.

Third-Party Services are governed solely by the terms and conditions of those Third-Party Services and Mixpanel is not responsible for the performance of and does not endorse any Third-Party Services or any information or materials advertised in any Third-Party Services. If Customer installs, enables or uses Third-Party Services with the Application Services that requires the transfer of Customer Content for the Third-Party Services to interoperate with the Application Services, Customer grants Mixpanel permission to allow the provider of the Third-Party Services to access or receive Customer Content for the interoperation of that Third-Party Service with the Application Services. Mixpanel is not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any transferring, transmitting, damage, disclosure, modification, deletion or loss caused to Customer or Customer Content by Customer‚Äôs use of or reliance on any Third-Party Services and Mixpanel does not guarantee the interoperability of such Third-Party Services with the Application Services. It is Customer‚Äôs responsibility to evaluate the information, opinion, advice, or other services available on and through the Application Services. Mixpanel does not provide the equipment required to access the Application Services. As between Mixpanel and Customer, Customer is responsible for complying with licenses, the applicable terms and conditions, providing required notices and obtaining appropriate consents from its end-users and paying fees for Third-Party Services.

8.1 Confidential Information. As used herein, ‚Äú**Confidential Information**‚Äù means all confidential and proprietary information of a party (‚Äú**Disclosing Party**‚Äú) disclosed to the other party (‚Äú**Receiving Party**‚Äú), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information shall not include, or shall cease to include, as applicable, information that (i) is publicly available or in the public domain at the time disclosed; (ii) is or becomes publicly available or enters the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully communicated to the Receiving Party by persons not bound by confidentiality obligations with respect thereto; (iv) is already in the Receiving Party‚Äôs possession free of any confidentiality obligations with respect thereto at the time of disclosure; (v) is independently developed by the Receiving Party; or (vi) is approved for release or disclosure by the Disclosing Party without restriction.

8.2 Use of Confidential Information. The Parties acknowledge that during the performance of this Agreement, each Party will have access to certain of the other Party‚Äôs Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall: (i) use Confidential Information of Disclosing Party only for the purposes described herein; (ii) hold in confidence and protect such Confidential Information from dissemination to, and use by, any third party, (except as needed to carry out the purposes of this Agreement) in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of like kind, but in no event shall Receiving Party exercise less than reasonable care in protecting such Confidential Information; (iii) restrict access to the Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party to those of its employees, contractors, personnel, agents, and/or consultants, if any, who have a need to have access in order to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and who have signed an agreement containing disclosure and use provisions substantially similar to those set forth herein; and (iv) to the extent practicable, upon request of the Disclosing Party return or destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that is in its possession upon termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party‚Äôs request and expense, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. Due to the unique nature of the Parties‚Äô Confidential Information disclosed hereunder, there can be no adequate remedy at law for a Party‚Äôs breach of its obligations hereunder, and any such breach may result in irreparable harm to the non-breaching Party. Therefore, upon any such breach, the Party alleging breach shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available to it, without the requirement of posting a bond.
