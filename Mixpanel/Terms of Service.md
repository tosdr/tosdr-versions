Terms of Use
------------

USE OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED BY MIXPANEL, INC. (“MIXPANEL”) AND REFERENCED HEREIN IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THIS MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT AND ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS REFERENCED HEREIN OR ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE PARTIES (“AGREEMENT”). BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OR BY USING MIXPANEL’S APPLICATION SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU AND THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT AND ANY AFFILIATE OF SUCH ENTITY INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, “CUSTOMER”) AGREE THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND CUSTOMER TO THESE TERMS AND HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY OR DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE MIXPANEL’S APPLICATION SERVICES. THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO AS OF THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS OR USE THE APPLICATION SERVICES (“EFFECTIVE DATE”).

### 1\. USE OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES

1.1 Use of Application Services. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Mixpanel grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to access and use the Application Services solely for Customer’s internal business purposes and not for resale or further distribution. Customer’s right to access and use the Application Services shall be subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms and conditions contained herein and limited to the Subscription Plan and the Subscription Term purchased by Customer.

1.2 Authorized Users. Customer may allow Authorized Users to access and use the Application Services; provided Customer shall be responsible for ensuring its Authorized Users use the Application Services in compliance with Customer’s obligations under this Agreement.

1.3 Subscription Plans.

1.3.1 Subscription Plans. The Application Services are provided through existing and legacy Subscription Plans. For all Subscription Plans: a “**Data Point**” or “**Event**” shall mean a JSON object comprised of an event (string) and a dictionary of properties (object) that is stored by the Application Services; a “**User Profile**” shall mean a JSON object comprised of an identifier or identifying string intended to indicate a unique user and a dictionary of properties (object) that is stored by the Application Services; and a “**Monthly Tracked User**” or “**MTU**” shall mean a unique identifier sent with at least one Data Point to the Application Services in a calendar month.

1.3.2 Free Services. Mixpanel offers free Subscription Plans at no cost that have limited features, functionality, and volume tiers, for specified Subscription Terms. Mixpanel reserves the right to modify the free Subscription Plans at any time in its sole discretion or even discontinue, suspend or terminate them entirely, without prior notice to Customer.

1.3.3 Legacy Services. From time to time Mixpanel may, at its sole discretion, cease to offer certain Subscription Plans (“**Legacy Subscription Plan**”). If Customer is on a paid Legacy Subscription Plan, Mixpanel shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior written notice of the deprecation of such Legacy Subscription Plan and related support until the end of Customer’s then current Subscription Term.

1.4 A La Carte Fees. Usage of the Application Services exceeding the volume tier of the Subscription Plan purchased by Customer will result in Customer being charged additional fees (“A La Carte Fees”), at 150% of the unit price applicable to Customer’s selected volume tier (unless otherwise provided in an Order Form), and Customer shall be obligated to pay any A La Carte Fees the following month. For Subscription Plans on MTUs, if the number of Data Points/Events or updates to User Profiles sent by Customer to the Application Services in a calendar month is greater than the number equal to the quantity of MTUs sent to the Application Services in such calendar month multiplied by 1,000, each and every additional 1,000 Data Points/Events or updates to User Profiles shall be considered an additional MTU for the purposes of calculating A La Carte Fees.

1.5 Pricing. Mixpanel reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the pricing of its services and Subscription Plans, add new services or pricing plans for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time without prior notice to Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fees set forth on an Order Form shall remain fixed for the duration of the Subscription Term set forth therein and any new pricing, additional fees and/or charges shall become effective at the start of a new Subscription Term, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties.

### 2\. ACCESS TO THE APPLICATION SERVICES

2.1 Restrictions. Customer shall not and shall not permit or authorize any third party,including, but not limited to its Authorized Users, to: (i) copy, rent, sell, lease, sublicense, distribute, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to the Application Services, or use the Application Services for the benefit of any third party, or make the Application Services available to anyone other than its Authorized Users; (ii) use the Application Services to send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of applicable laws, or to process, send or store Prohibited Information, infringing or unlawful material, viruses, worms, time bombs, Trojan horses or other harmful or malicious code, files, scripts, agents or programs; (iii) circumvent or disable any digital rights management, usage rules, or other security features of the Application Services, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to, or disrupt the integrity or performance of, the Application Services or the data contained therein; (iv) modify, copy, translate, enhance, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or create derivative works based on the Application Services, or any portion thereof; (v) access or use the Application Services for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or copying its features or user interface; (vi) remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices appearing in or on the Application Services; or (vii) use the Application Services in a manner that overburdens, or that threatens the integrity, performance, or availability of, the Application Services.

2.2 Maintenance. You acknowledge that the Application Services are an on-line, subscription-based product and that, in order to provide an improved customer experience, Mixpanel may make changes to the Application Services and update the applicable Documentation accordingly, over time.

2.3 Excess Burden. Mixpanel reserves the right to temporarily restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the Application Services at any time, if in Mixpanel’s sole determination, Customer is using the Application Services in a manner that violates applicable laws or causes material harm or risk to Mixpanel or to any other party, including, but not limited to creating an Excess Burden on Mixpanel’s systems.

Beta Services are provided on an “as-is” and “as available” basis without any warranty, support, maintenance, storage, service-level agreement or indemnity obligation of any kind and are not considered “Application Services” hereunder, even if displayed in the user interface; provided, however, that all restrictions herein, Mixpanel’s reservation of rights and Customer’s obligations concerning the Application Services shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Mixpanel may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Mixpanel will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with a Beta Service. Beta Services may be considered Confidential Information of Mixpanel, if so denoted or communicated by Mixpanel to Customer. Customer will not disclose (including, but not limited to, in a press release or public statement) any information about, involving or regarding Beta Services (including the existence of), except as agreed by Mixpanel in writing.

4.5 Customer Content Deletion. Mixpanel provides Customer with access to Customer Content and the ability to delete Customer Content through the Application Services. Upon termination of Mixpanel’s relationship with Customer, Mixpanel has no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Content and will delete Customer Content unless prohibited by law.

4.6 Security. Mixpanel will maintain appropriate physical, technical and organizational controls designed to safeguard Customer Content within its cloud storage from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. These controls will include measures designed to store Customer Content on servers located in a physically secured location; and the use of firewalls, access controls and similar security technologies designed to protect Customer Content from unauthorized disclosure. Mixpanel takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Customer Content other than its express security obligations in this section and Customer understands and agrees that Mixpanel will not be responsible or liable for any breach or loss of Customer Content resulting from Customer’s security configuration or administration of the Application Services.

4.7 Customer Security Obligations. Customer agrees that, without limiting Mixpanel’s obligations under Section 4.6, Customer is solely responsible for its use and configuration of the Application Services, including (i) maintaining appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to maintain a level of security for the Customer Content appropriate to the risk; (ii) securing Customer’s systems and devices used to access the Application Services; (iii) maintaining its own backups of Customer Content; (iv) decisions not to use privacy or security settings or features available in the Application Services; and (v) choices related to the type of Customer Content (including, if any, Personal Information) transferred to the Application Services through Customer’s configuration of the Application Services. Without limitation of the foregoing, certain parts of the Application Services, including account management features, may be password-restricted to registered users or other authorized persons (“**Password-Protected Areas**”). If Customer is authorized to gain access to any Password-Protected Areas, Customer agrees that Customer is entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Customer’s password and agrees to notify Mixpanel if the password is lost, stolen, disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. Customer agrees that Customer is entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under Customer’s account, whether or not Customer undertakes such activities. Customer agrees to immediately notify Mixpanel of any unauthorized use of Customer’s account or any other breach of security in relation to Customer’s password or the Application Services that is known to Customer.

4.8 Privacy Statement. Mixpanel’s tracking and use of information collected about Customer on Mixpanel Sites are governed by the Mixpanel Privacy Statement, available at [https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

In addition, Mixpanel may collect registration and other information about Customer as Mixpanel’s customer through Mixpanel Sites.

### 5\. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The Application Services and Documentation may display, contain links to, or connect with third-party products, services, and websites (collectively, “**Third-Party Services**”). The Application Services allow Customer to import data from and export data to Third-Party Services. By using the Application Services, Customer authorizes Mixpanel to transfer, store, and process Customer Content from and to Customer’s Third-Party Services accounts on its behalf. Any statements, services, offers, or other information that constitutes part of the Third-Party Services made available by third parties on the Application Services or Mixpanel Sites, or which are accessible through the Application Services are those of the respective authors or producers and not of Mixpanel or its stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, or representatives. Mixpanel does not control Third-Party Services and does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services are governed solely by the terms and conditions of those Third-Party Services and Mixpanel is not responsible for the performance of and does not endorse any Third-Party Services or any information or materials advertised in any Third-Party Services. If Customer installs, enables or uses Third-Party Services with the Application Services that requires the transfer of Customer Content for the Third-Party Services to interoperate with the Application Services, Customer grants Mixpanel permission to allow the provider of the Third-Party Services to access or receive Customer Content for the interoperation of that Third-Party Service with the Application Services. Mixpanel is not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any transferring, transmitting, damage, disclosure, modification, deletion or loss caused to Customer or Customer Content by Customer’s use of or reliance on any Third-Party Services and Mixpanel does not guarantee the interoperability of such Third-Party Services with the Application Services. It is Customer’s responsibility to evaluate the information, opinion, advice, or other services available on and through the Application Services. Mixpanel does not provide the equipment required to access the Application Services. As between Mixpanel and Customer, Customer is responsible for complying with licenses, the applicable terms and conditions, providing required notices and obtaining appropriate consents from its end-users and paying fees for Third-Party Services.

### 6\. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

If Customer purchases Professional Services for a fee as indicated in an Order Form or Professional Services are included as part of a Subscription Plan pursuant to the Documentation, then the terms and conditions of this Section 6 shall apply. The Professional Services primarily involve advising Customer on the integration of Customer Content with and into the Application Services. With Customer’s consent, Mixpanel may enter into Customer’s account and access Customer Content as needed to provide the Professional Services.

6.2 Assistance. Mixpanel and Customer agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory completion of the Professional Services in a professional manner.

The Parties hereby agree that the specified Professional Services primarily involve advising Customer on the implementation of the Application Services and integration of Customer’s data with and into the Application Services.

### 8\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; FEEDBACK

8.1 Confidential Information. As used herein, “**Confidential Information**” means all confidential and proprietary information of a party (“**Disclosing Party**“) disclosed to the other party (“**Receiving Party**“), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information shall not include, or shall cease to include, as applicable, information that (i) is publicly available or in the public domain at the time disclosed; (ii) is or becomes publicly available or enters the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully communicated to the Receiving Party by persons not bound by confidentiality obligations with respect thereto; (iv) is already in the Receiving Party’s possession free of any confidentiality obligations with respect thereto at the time of disclosure; (v) is independently developed by the Receiving Party; or (vi) is approved for release or disclosure by the Disclosing Party without restriction.

8.2 Use of Confidential Information. The Parties acknowledge that during the performance of this Agreement, each Party will have access to certain of the other Party’s Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall: (i) use Confidential Information of Disclosing Party only for the purposes described herein; (ii) hold in confidence and protect such Confidential Information from dissemination to, and use by, any third party, (except as needed to carry out the purposes of this Agreement) in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of like kind, but in no event shall Receiving Party exercise less than reasonable care in protecting such Confidential Information; (iii) restrict access to the Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party to those of its employees, contractors, personnel, agents, and/or consultants, if any, who have a need to have access in order to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and who have signed an agreement containing disclosure and use provisions substantially similar to those set forth herein; and (iv) to the extent practicable, upon request of the Disclosing Party return or destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that is in its possession upon termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party’s request and expense, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. Due to the unique nature of the Parties’ Confidential Information disclosed hereunder, there can be no adequate remedy at law for a Party’s breach of its obligations hereunder, and any such breach may result in irreparable harm to the non-breaching Party. Therefore, upon any such breach, the Party alleging breach shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available to it, without the requirement of posting a bond.

8.3 Feedback. If Customer or its Authorized Users provide Mixpanel any suggestions, recommendations, comments, corrections, enhancements, feature and/or functionality requests or other feedback relating to Mixpanel’s current or future products or services, including Beta Services (“**Feedback**”), Mixpanel shall have the right to use the Feedback in any manner, including, but not limited to future enhancements and modifications to the Application Services. Customer agrees that such Feedback is given voluntarily, and hereby grants to Mixpanel and its assigns a perpetual, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, fully paid-up, irrevocable, royalty free license to use, reproduce, modify, disclose, create derivative works from, distribute, commercialize and display the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, in any media, software, or technology of any kind now existing or developed in the future, without any obligation to provide attribution or compensation to Customer or any third party. For the avoidance of doubt, Feedback does not include Customer Confidential Information or Customer Content. In addition, Mixpanel shall be free to reuse all general knowledge, experience, know-how, works and technologies (including ideas, concepts, processes and techniques) related to or acquired during provision of the Application Services and Professional Services.
