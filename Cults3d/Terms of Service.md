### b) Rules for the VAT application on Cults

#### How VAT works

The VAT reform for e-commerce in Europe, which came into effect on July 1, 2021, establishes new rules to be followed in the VAT application.  
The VAT rate applied to the Cults commission will differ depending on the status of the seller, whether he is an individual or a professional seller, and on the country of the buyer.  
The seller status is determined according to the legal identity that he has declared in his personal Cults account.  
The buyer’s origin is determined according to the legal identity declared in their personal Cults account or, failing that, via their IP address.  
The revenues sent to the designer when they request payment are gross revenues. Each vendor will need to manage their own accounting and tax compliance according to their status and country of tax residence.  
Using the tools and information provided by Cults in their personal account, the seller will be able to declare or not to declare VAT on each of their sales revenues according to their tax status and the nature and identity of their customers.

CULTS cannot be held responsible for any false declaration by the seller resulting in an error concerning the applicable VAT rate.

#### Case of an individual seller

* If the buyer is a European Union resident, the VAT rate applied to the Cults commission will be the one applicable in his/her country (VAD regime).
* If the buyer resides in a country outside the European Union, no VAT is applied on the Cults commission (EXPORT regime).

### Case of a professional seller

* If the seller is a professional whose company is based in France, the VAT rate applied to the Cults commission is 20% (NORMAL regime).
* If the seller is a professional whose company is based in a European Union country and has a valid intra-community VAT number entered in his Cults account, no VAT is applied to the Cults commission (AUTOLIQUIDATION regime).
* If the seller is a professional whose company is based in a country outside the European Union, no VAT is applied to the Cults commission (EXPORT system).

The Creator can make withdrawals from their generated revenue on the platform via four different payment methods, namely Payoneer, Stripe Connect, PayPal, or bank transfer.

To be paid via Payoneer, they must synchronize their Payoneer account with their Cults account via their personal space by clicking on the "Connect to Payoneer" button. The Creator must have a valid and verified account with Payoneer.

To be paid via Stripe, they must synchronize their Stripe account with their Cults account via their personal space by clicking on the "Connect to Stripe" button. The Creator must have a valid and verified account with Stripe.

To request payment via PayPal, the creator must provide the email address of their PayPal account in their personal space. The Creator must have a valid and verified account with PayPal.

To receive payment by bank transfer, they must provide their bank details in their personal space. The holder of the connected bank account must be the same person/entity as the holder of the Cults account (name, address, country... must match the bank account provided).

It is important to note that the Creator is not authorized to request payment via PayPal if the amount of their payment exceeds €500. In this specific case, they are invited to use Payoneer, Stripe, or bank transfer to make their withdrawal.

It is also important to note that the Creator is not authorized to request payment via bank transfer if the amount of their payment has not reached €500. In this specific case, they are invited to use Payoneer, Stripe, or PayPal to make their withdrawal.

Detailed instructions for each payment method are provided on the platform. It is important to follow the rules and limits regarding payments to avoid any confusion or issues with the platform. It is also essential that the Creator has provided all the KYCs requested by the approved payment partners and that they match those provided to Cults.

To accept the payment and withdraw its balance, the CREATOR has a period of one month (period defined by PayPal). After this period, without recovering his balance, the amount of the sale is returned to CULTS, without refund. The statute of limitations for outstanding sales is 5 years. After this period, the designer will no longer be able to claim payment for these obsolete sales.

CULTS cannot be held responsible for cases of fraudulent sales. If a banking partner informs CULTS of a fraudulent sale, or if a user pays with a stolen card, this sale will be cancelled and the Creator will not be paid for this sale. Any sale is considered fraudulent if the buyer does not pay - at the time of the sale or later - the price of the creation.

CULTS cannot be held responsible for any misrepresentation on the part of the seller resulting in an error concerning the applicable VAT rate.

Article VIII: Responsibility of CULTS
-------------------------------------

CULTS make no warranty for the choice of a final customer toward a creation given by the Creator.

Accordingly, CULTS can in no way be liable for any direct, incidental, indirect or consequential, that may suffer the Creator due to use or non-use of Creation, even if the parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

As the termination of this Agreement, CULTS shall cease using Creation and destroy from his computer system and its storage devices.

Article IX: Information & Disclaimer
------------------------------------

The creator agrees to be informed by this contract that the sale of rights to use his creation for making objects from this creation is likely to lead to a qualification creator merchant within the meaning of Article L121 -1 of the Commercial Code, requiring certain specific obligations, such as the entry in the Register of Commerce and Companies, the holding of a particular accounting, payment of VAT and other applicable taxes, and compliance with the rules on invoicing.

Indeed, under Article L121 -1 of the Commercial Code: “Are those traders who carry out acts of commerce and make their own occupation”.  
For the creator, repeat sales of the product of his or her work that generate substantial income can be regarded as an act of commerce and therefore fell within the scope of a regulated professional activity including the Labour Code, the Commercial Code and the General Code taxes.

Thus a person who usually sells his creations or any products on a marketplace and draws regular income, must create a business company. There is no minimum or maximum sales threshold. It is the regularity of the activity, its nature and profit organization set up to allow the justice to determine in each case these criteria and qualify some dealers traders.  
In this case the creator, considered a professional seller would be required to meet the particular legal obligations above mentioned non- exhaustive way.

Consequently, the designer shall undertake to fulfill all tax and social security obligations related to the sale of his creations.  
CULTS is not seller, it only pays the French VAT on its commission and therefore disclaims all liability for any fraud that may be made by creators outside the tax legislation applicable to traders.  
CULTS is authorized to disclose all necessary information to the tax authorities under request.
