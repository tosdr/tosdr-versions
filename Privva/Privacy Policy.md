3.   Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Data

Smarsh takes care to use your Personal Data carefully  and in an appropriate way. Use of Personal Data under certain data protection laws, including GDPR, must be based on legal grounds. Smarsh uses or shares your Personal Data where:

1\. Needed to comply with a legal obligation, including responding to a legal request for information, subpoena, warrant, or other request from a competent legal or regulatory authority.

2.You consented to such use. For example, if you provided consent to receive marketing material. You may withdraw your consent at any time as described below.

3.It’s necessary under a contract between you and Smarsh, or because something needed to be completed in order for you to enter into a contract with us (e.g., due diligence).

4.Its use is in accordance with our legitimate interests, such as legitimate business interests, to those interests not overriding your fundamental rights. For example, monitoring our Website, preventing illegal activities, or pursuant to a sale or merger (for the purposes of due diligence or to effect such sale or merger post-closing).

If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). If the processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 also allow users the right to access, revoke, or modify your consent at any time. Please see the Exercising Your Rights section, below on how to review or modify your consents 

4.     Consent to Transfer 

We are operated in the United States, and we may use service providers based in the United States to operate our business and our relationship with you. Please be aware that information, including your Personal Data, that we collect will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen. We maintain measures to address the transfer of your Personal Data between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations.

5.     Retention

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as needed for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. More specifically, the time we maintain your Personal Data depends on the following factors:

·       Whether we need the Personal Data to provide the Services.  We will maintain any data needed to provide you with the Services, such as contact information and payment or transaction information, for as long as needed for us to provide you with the Services, respond to your questions and requests, and/or administer your account (if applicable).

·       Whether we need the Personal Data to comply with our legal obligations. We may have legal obligations to maintain your Personal Data where a legal or regulatory body may ask for it in the future, for example in response to a data subject request or complaint. This information may include contact information and location information.

·       Whether we need the Personal Data for a legitimate business interest.  We may store Personal Data like contact information, cookies, and location information in order to perform analytics, troubleshoot errors, or improve our Services. In any event, we delete the Personal Data when it is no longer needed for our legitimate interest.

Regardless of our reason for retaining your information, we delete all Personal Data in accordance with our routine record keeping policies.
