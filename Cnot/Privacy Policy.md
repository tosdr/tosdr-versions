### What is CNOT?

CNOT is an educational resource on quantum computing.

  

### The aims of this website are to:

* Guide the user through relevant topics in a sensible order
* Be a reference for the necessary background and prerequisite material
* Be an additional resource for learning about quantum computing
* Give the user the knowledge to read and understand material beyond the scope of this website

  

### Why?

Quantum Computing has only really been around since the ‘80s, but it already promises efficient solutions to many of the problems conventional computers struggle with.

While quantum computing requires a decent background in maths, a lot of theoretical quantum computing ideas should be accessible to anyone doing an undergraduate mathematics, physics or computing course.

Unfortunately, quantum physics is quite unintuitive, and quantum computing is very interdisciplinary which can create hurdles when a new student tries to tackle it. For example, a computer scientist is unlikely to have come across Dirac notation, which most quantum computing literature uses, and a physicist is unlikely to have learnt about the different classes of computing problems that quantum computing is so useful at solving.

The main purpose of this website is to guide a new learner through the main topics in a sensible order, and to provide a reference for all the relevant background & prerequisite material needed to understand modern quantum computing literature. The idea is that a student can use this website to decide “what to learn next”, and refer back to this website if they come across something they are unfamiliar with.
