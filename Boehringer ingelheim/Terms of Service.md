**Dispute Resolution**

These Dispute Resolution procedures apply to any claim or disagreement that arises as of the effective date of this notice and will not be applied retroactively.

You agree that whenever you have a disagreement with us arising out of, connected to, or in any way related to these Terms of Use, you will send a written notice to us (a “**Demand**”). You agree that the requirements of this section will apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms of Use. You must send this Demand to the following address (the “**Notice Address**”):

Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corporation

P.O. Box 368

900 Ridgebury Road

Ridgefield, CT 06877-0368

Attn: Corporate Affairs

Informal Dispute Resolution. You agree that you will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until ten (10) business days after you send this Demand.

Binding Arbitration. If we do not resolve this disagreement to your satisfaction within ten (10) business days, and you intend on taking legal action, you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “**Arbitrator**”). Review this section carefully. This arbitration provision limits your and Boehringer ’s ability to litigate claims in court and you and Boehringer each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial or a state or federal judge. You agree that you will not file any lawsuit against us in any state or federal court. You agree that if you do sue us in state or federal court, and we bring a successful motion to compel arbitration, you must pay all fees and costs incurred by us in court, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

Please note that for any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must effect proper service under the rules of the Arbitrator, and that notice to the Notice Address may not suffice. If, for any reason, the AAA is unable to provide the arbitration, you may file your case with any national arbitration company. The Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedure as effective September 15, 2005. You agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute you have with us. You understand that the Federal Arbitration Act allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements, and you agree that it applies.

Class or Collective Action Waiver. You agree that you will not file a class action or collective action against us, and that you will not participate in a class action or collective action against us. You agree that you will not join your claims to those of any other person. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms of Use, if this class action waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to arbitrate is null and void, as though it were never entered into. Any dispute at that time in arbitration will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled in a court. Under no circumstances do you or we agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in arbitration.

We agree that we will not file a class or collective action against you, and that we will not participate in a class or collective action against you, for any disagreement arising out of, connected to, or in any way related to these Terms of Use. We agree that we will submit all disputes with you to arbitration before the Arbitrator.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the Arbitrator. These Terms of Use and their performance shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Each party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Clark County, the State of Connecticut in all questions and controversies arising out of your use of the Site and these Terms of Use.

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU PERMANENTLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT UNLESS YOU BRING THE CLAIM OR ACTION WITHIN TWO (2)\] YEARS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION AROSE OR ACCRUED.**
