The purpose is to allow for conversion payments that occur with CPC or other performance events that are not only CPA.

**4.2 Cost Per Click Fees**  
Appcast will calculate the fees owed based on data collected via the Services, which you agree will be the system of record for determining the number of clicks driven by Appcast and the Appcast Publisher Network (herein “Appcast Driven Clicks”) and corresponding fees. For payments related to Appcast Driven Clicks, nothing herein absolves you from financial obligations to Publishers. In the event you do not remit full and satisfactory payment of the fees to Appcast within thirty (30) days after the invoice due date, Appcast may suspend or terminate access to and performance of the Services. In such case, you will indemnify, defend and hold Appcast and its employees, officers, directors, respective agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all loss, cost, damage and expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from Appcast’s refusal to perform services associated to the Services, including any claims asserted by Publishers. For avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Appcast be obligated to remit Publisher payments to any Publisher if it has not yet received full and satisfactory payment for all prior Publisher payments. You agree that you are ultimately obligated to pay the Publishers and Appcast is acting solely as an agent for you in remitting payments to the Publishers. We will invoice you for all fees on a monthly basis. Unless you have pre-paid the fees, you will remit payment to Appcast within thirty (30) days after issuance of each invoice. You will pay to Appcast a fee for each Appcast Driven Click submitted to you or to your website. The fee for each Appcast Driven Click will be the cost-per-click designated by you when you use the Services.

**4.3 Fee Changes**

Appcast may change the fees and payment policies for the Services by notifying you in writing (including email) at least thirty days before the change takes effect.

Users who do not accept the new fees must cancel their Subscription, if any, and terminate their use of the Services according to the provisions set out in Section 7. Users who continue to use the Services after the new fees become effective will be deemed to have accepted them.

##### Job Seeker Terms

Job Seeker Terms of Use

Last Updated: January 18, 2023

**Introduction**.

Appcast, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” or “Appcast”) offers a service to facilitate the job application process between job applicants (“you”, “your” or “users”) and employers (the “Service”). Any resume or application information that you submit through the Service, including personal data included in a resume, application, or responses to screening questions, is subject to the terms and conditions contained in these Terms of Use (“Terms”) and will be processed in accordance with Appcast’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.appcast.io/privacy-policy/).These Terms are legally binding and your use of the Service serves as your acceptance of the Terms. If you do not agree with any of the Terms, do not use the Service.

We may amend the Terms by posting the amended versions on our website.  You agree that the foregoing will constitute sufficient and effective notice.  By continuing to use the Service more than 30 days after we post an amended version, you confirm your acceptance of the Terms as amended. If you do not agree with any of the changes, you must immediately stop using the Service.

By using the Service, and providing information, whether in the form of a job application, resume, or otherwise, you agree that Appcast does not have control over an employer’s use or disclosure of that information and that we are not responsible or liable for the manner in which an  employer uses the information you provide via the Service. When you apply for a job via the Service, Appcast does not guarantee the transmission of your information or that any employer will receive, review, or respond to any such resume or other application materials. Further, you agree that Appcast is not responsible for the content of the employer’s job application, job advertisement, messages, or screening questions and we do not control or participate in the employer’s hiring decisions.

**IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT REQUIRES YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH APPCAST ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A JURY TRIAL. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.**

**1\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.**

BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST APPCAST ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ARBITRATION, AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION. THIS WILL PRECLUDE YOU FROM BRINGING ANY CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION AGAINST APPCAST, AND ALSO PRECLUDE YOU FROM PARTICIPATING IN OR RECOVERING RELIEF UNDER ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION BROUGHT AGAINST APPCAST BY SOMEONE ELSE.

Most disputes that arise out of the use of the Service can be resolved quickly, informally, and with mutual satisfaction by reaching out to us at contact@appcast.io.

If any dispute remains unresolved after that process, however, you and Appcast agree to have all disputes resolved by arbitration, which shall be final and binding on both parties, except disputes (i) that may be brought in an individual action in small claims court, (ii) that relate to the ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights, or (iii) that relate to the processing of your personal data, and are subject to privacy and data protection laws, which shall be governed by the terms in our Privacy Policy. In addition, you and Appcast each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. In any such case, your waiver of the right to a jury trial and the class action waiver set forth in this Agreement shall continue to apply.

“Dispute” includes any dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, between you and Appcast concerning the Service or Terms, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. You and Appcast empower the Arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of the Terms are void or voidable.

CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. BY ENTERING INTO THE TERMS, YOU AND APPCAST EACH EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. ADDITIONALLY, YOU AND APPCAST AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND THAT THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, OTHER USERS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONS. As such, you and Appcast acknowledge and agree that each waives any right to participation as a plaintiff or a class member in a class action litigation or arbitration, or in any other collective or consolidated action, with respect to these terms. Neither you nor Appcast may be a representative of any other potential claimants or class of potential claimants in any such dispute, nor may two or more users’ disputes be consolidated or otherwise determined in one proceeding. This will also preclude you and Appcast from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, joint, collective, representative, or consolidated action brought by someone else.

 A.  Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of New Hampshire.

B.  Initiating Arbitration. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration – Consumer Arbitration Rules at [adr.org](http://www.adr.org/)or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Arbitrator will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the proposed list of arbitrators by the AAA, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

C.  Location and Procedures. If the claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Appcast submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing and the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the claim exceeds $10,000, arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online, and your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Proceedings that cannot be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or online, will take place in Grafton County, New Hampshire or in another jurisdiction to which you and Appcast agree in writing. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

D.  Arbitrator’s Decision. The Arbitrator will render a written award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules and shall provide a written decision with a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, but only in favor of the individual claimant, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The Arbitrator shall not have authority to entertain any claim on behalf of a person who is not a named party, nor shall the Arbitrator have authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any person who is not a named party. The Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.

You and Appcast agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Grafton County, New Hampshire in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

E.  Fees. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. Appcast will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the Arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (based on the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Likewise, Appcast will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (based on the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The right to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses set forth in the Terms supplements any right to attorneys’ fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. You may not, however, recover duplicative awards of attorneys’ fees or costs.

F.  Severability. If any part of this Arbitration Agreement, other than the class action waiver, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall be enforceable. The class action waiver is non-severable and if it is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the whole Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.

G.  Disputes with an Employer. You are solely responsible for your interactions with an employer. Appcast reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and an employer.

##### Anti-Slavery Policy

Anti-Slavery Statement

Last Updated: Dec 15, 2022

This policy is applicable to all Appcast, Inc. (the “Company”) employees, contractors and associated workers.

The Company reserves the right to modify this policy from time to time at its discretion and in line with UK legislation.  
  
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labor and human trafficking, all of which involve the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.

We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.

We are committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.  
  
**We are a company that expects everyone working with us or on our behalf follows the below measures to safeguard against modern slavery:**  
You must ensure that you read, understand, and comply with this policy.  
  
The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chains is the responsibility of all those working for us or under our control. You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.  
  
You must notify your manager as soon as possible if you believe or suspect that a breach of this policy has occurred or may occur in the future.  
  
If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their working conditions within any tier of our supply chains constitutes any of the various forms of modern slavery, raise it with your manager.  
  
We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if it turns out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith.

**Consistent with our risk-based approach we may require:**  
Employment and recruitment agencies and other third parties supplying workers to our organization to confirm their compliance with our Anti-Slavery & Human Trafficking Code.  
  
Suppliers engaging workers through a third party to obtain that third party’s agreement to adhere to the Anti-Slavery & Human Trafficking Code.  
  
As part of our ongoing risk assessment and due diligence processes, we will consider whether circumstances warrant us carrying out audits of suppliers for their compliance with our Anti-Slavery & Human Trafficking Code.  
  
If we find that other individuals or organizations working on our behalf have breached this policy, we will ensure that we take appropriate action. This may range from considering the possibility of breaches being remediated and whether that might represent the best outcome for those individuals impacted by the breach to terminating such relationships.

Training on this policy, and on the risk our business faces from modern slavery in its supply chains, will be provided as necessary.

Our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery in our business and supply chains must be communicated to all suppliers, contractors, and business partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and reinforced as appropriate thereafter.

Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for misconduct. Any criminal conduct may be reported to the police.  
  
We may terminate our relationship with other individuals and organizations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.
