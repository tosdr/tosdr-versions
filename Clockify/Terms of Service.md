4\. THE SERVICES

**4.1 Availability**_**.**_ You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement and the applicable Law. We will make the Services available to you pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable plan you have chosen. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available, except (a) during planned downtime (of which we will give reasonable advance notice if practicable); (b) for any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, for example, a force majeure event, performance issues with individual features, external network or equipment problems, or issues that are related to external apps or third parties; or (c) as necessary to update the Services to ensure their security and integrity and provide the Service.

To the extent permitted under applicable Law, we reserve the right at any time and from time-to-time to modify, suspend, upgrade, change, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part of them) with or without notice or liability to you. If you are dissatisfied with any modifications to our Services, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is to terminate your subscription and discontinue use of the Services.

**4.2 Updates and System or Technical Requirements.** From time-to-time we may issue updates to the Services. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded and installed the latest version of the Services, or hosting software, and accepted any new terms. Some updates may not be available to certain device models. In order to use the Services, you may be required to obtain certain updates and/or upgrades to your device. You are responsible for any costs and/or fees associated with any such updates/upgrades. You also understand and accept that (a) the device you use to access the Services will require certain software in order for the Services to work correctly and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the required up-to-date software; (b) the Services have not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the functionality of the Services meets your requirements; and (c) you are responsible for obtaining the data network access, and the required device necessary (including any associated costs or fees), to use the Services and any updates thereto.

If you integrate our Services into your network by using our API, you must use efficient programming, which will not cause an excessive number of requests to be made in too short a period of time, as determined solely by CAKE.com. If this occurs, CAKE.com reserves the right to limit your API connections or suspend or terminate your User Account.

**4.3 Location of Data Storage and Processing.** In some cases, we may provide you with the option to choose the location in which we store and process your data. To the extent we provide that option to you, we will only process and store your data in the designated location and not transfer your data outside that jurisdiction, except in accordance with applicable Law.

5\. APP ACCESS AND USE
----------------------

You may download and install the App through authorized app store providers and/or operators (each an "**App Store Provider**") only. Your use of the App under this Agreement is also subject to any terms, rules, or policies of any App Store Provider from which you download the App ("**App Store Terms**"), and by accessing or downloading the App from the App Store of the App Store Provider, you are agreeing to App Store Terms. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any App Store Terms, this Agreement governs and this Agreement will prevail.

You and we acknowledge and agree that, if you have downloaded the App from the App Store of the App Store Provider, the respective App Store Provider, and App Store Provider's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement and App Store Provider will have the right to enforce this Agreement against you directly.

We and our service providers are responsible for any maintenance and support of the App, and you acknowledge that any App Store Provider from which you download the App is not under any obligation to you to carry out any maintenance and/or support for the App itself.

You may only download and install the App onto a device that you own, or if you do not own the device, you must have the permission from the owner(s) of the device to do so. You accept responsibility under this Agreement for the use of the App, whether or not you own the device onto which the App is downloaded and installed. You also acknowledge that the owner(s) of the device onto which the App is installed may be charged by any relevant mobile network operator and/or internet service provider in relation to any data and/or mobile connectivity used by the App.

6\. ADD-ON ACCESS, INSTALLATION, AND USE; THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS AND OFFERINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 CAKE.com allows Add-On Providers to offer you Add-Ons through the Marketplace, which may include third-party products or services, including, for example, non-CAKE.com applications and implementation and other services. In addition, the Services or Software may contain features designed to interoperate with non-CAKE.com applications and may interoperate, integrate, or be used in connection with third party offerings and services ("**Third-Party Offerings**").

Your installation or use of any Add-Ons is completely voluntary, at your own risk, and within your sole discretion. CAKE.com does not operate or provide Add-Ons, and Add-Ons are subject to their own Add-On terms and conditions and privacy policy. Any acquisition by User of such Add-Ons, and any exchange of data between User and any Add-On Provider, product or service is solely between User and the applicable Add-On Provider. You understand and agree that by using or installing an Add-On, you agree to the Add-On terms and conditions and acknowledge that you have reviewed the Add-On privacy policy. You have sole discretion whether to purchase or connect to any Add-On and Third-Party Offerings, and your use of any Add-On and Third-Party Offering is governed solely by the terms of such Add-Ons and Third-Party Offerings.

You also understand that Add-Ons may collect, process, disclose, store, and/or delete your information, including personal information, in a manner that is different than CAKE.com, and that by using or installing an Add-On you are providing your information, including personal information to the Add-On Provider who will act as the controller or business, as defined by applicable privacy laws, with respect to any such information.

6.2 Add-Ons shall be initially installed and paid per Workspace, and gradually Add-Ons shall be installed and paid either per Workspace or per Seat. All Add-On installations and Add-On subscriptions shall be on a monthly basis. Each Add-On subscription shall have its own invoice cycle and subscription cycle.

You may cancel Add-On subscription by uninstalling the respective Add-On, in which case you shall not be entitled to a refund. When the Add-On is uninstalled the Add-On subscription is cancelled at the end of the subscription cycle. In case you avail yourself of your right to uninstall the Add-On, you shall be entitled to reinstall such Add-On without additional payment and your subscription shall be reactivated. Such Add-On installation shall be valid until the end of the respective subscription cycle free of charge.

Your Add-On subscription might also be cancelled in case developer requests the deletion of the Add-On and if CAKE.com approves such a request, all the subscriptions to such Add-On shall be cancelled and such subscriptions shall be valid until the end of the respective Add-On subscription cycle.

6.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, CAKE.com shall collect and handle payment relating to your use of Add-Ons on behalf of Add-On Providers to the extent applicable. Add-On Providers will determine the amounts you must pay to use their Add-Ons, and you agree to pay those amounts in advance and in full, in U.S. dollars (USD), Euro (EUR) or Swiss francs (CHF), depending on the territory where you are domiciled and where is your official business address and, without deducting or allowing the deduction of any currency conversion, remittance, applicable tax, or other charges related to the payment. Payment via wire transfer relating to your use of Add-Ons shall not be feasible and allowed. The fees are exclusive of any VAT or other taxes and public duties, except where explicitly stated to the contrary. It is each User's responsibility to bear all public duties related to the purchase of any Add-Ons.

6.4 All payments are handled by a third-party payment processor. CAKE.com is not responsible for the processing of your payment and shall not be liable for any matter in connection therewith. Paid fees are non-refundable, and you understand and agree that CAKE.com is not responsible for and has no authority to negotiate or respond to any payment disputes you have with the Add-On Provider.

6.5 CAKE.com allows Add-On Providers to offer Add-Ons to you in the Marketplace, but CAKE.com has no obligation to offer, continue to offer, delete, and/or maintain any particular Add-Ons. CAKE.com may, within its sole discretion, discontinue or make unavailable any Add-Ons in its Marketplace with no liability to you. CAKE.com will endeavour where practicable to provide thirty (30) days prior notice before discontinuing or making unavailable any Add-Ons, but you acknowledge and agree that that is not always possible because CAKE.com does not provide the Add-Ons.

CAKE.com cannot guarantee the continued availability of Add-Ons and Third-Party Offerings and Add-On Provider may cease providing them without entitling User to any refund, credit, or other compensation, if for example and without limitation, the Add-On Provider ceases to make the Add-Ons and Third-Party Offerings available for interoperation with the corresponding Service features in a manner acceptable to CAKE.com.

**6.6 Disclaimer of Warranties With Respect to Add-Ons.** CAKE.com is in no way liable or responsible for your installation or use of the Add-Ons or any claims, issues, or complaints you have relating to the Add-Ons. CAKE.com is not responsible for, and CAKE.com hereby disclaims any liability for, any act or omission of any Add-On Provider or any provider of Third-Party Offerings or the operation of any Add-Ons or Third-Party Offerings, including access to, modification of, or deletion of data, regardless of whether CAKE.com or a Service endorses, approves, or supports any such Add-Ons or Third-Party Offerings. CAKE.com is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of User Data resulting from access by such Add-On application or Add-On Provider.

By allowing Add-On Providers to offer Add-Ons to you in the Marketplace, CAKE.com in no way endorses or sponsors any Add-Ons or Add-On Providers and makes no representations or warranties with respect to any Add-Ons. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us, we provide our Marketplace and any Add-Ons contained thereon "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, because Add-On Providers operate and provide Add-Ons and not CAKE.com, CAKE.com does not represent or warrant that the Add-Ons and Third-Party Offerings are accurate, complete, reliable, current, error-free, secure, timely, or will be uninterrupted or of satisfactory quality. Furthermore, CAKE.com does not guarantee the interoperation, integration, or support of any Add-Ons or Third-Party Offerings. CAKE.com may, at any time, in its sole discretion, modify the Services or Software, which may result in the failed interoperation, integration, or support of Add-Ons and Third-Party Offerings. You understand and agree that CAKE.com cannot and does not represent or warrant that any Add-Ons are free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Add-Ons. User is solely responsible for any damage User may suffer resulting from the use of or inability to use the Add-Ons. No oral or written information or advice given by CAKE.com or its authorized representatives shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of CAKE.com's obligations.

You shall comply with and ensure that all End Users, Business Users and Authorized Users comply with, all applicable Laws in connection with your obligations under this Agreement, including access to and use of the Services and Software.

14\. SUBSCRIPTION
-----------------

By creating a User Account within our Services, you automatically start your Free Plan. You may choose to switch from the Free Plan to any Subscription Plan at any time. Once you choose to do so, we will start to apply the respective subscription fees in accordance with the applicable Subscription Plan. **Your Subscription Plan will continue for the length of the Subscription Term you select and will automatically renew for additional periods of the same length ("Renewal Term") unless you cancel it and unless applicable Law prohibits automatic renewal.** Each Renewal Term for the Services will begin automatically at the end of the then-current initial Subscription Plan or Renewal Term. Your subscription fee in effect at the time of your automatic renewal will continue for your Renewal Term unless we notify you at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the end of the Subscription Term i.e. prior to the commencement of the next Renewal Term for a yearly Subscription Plan or ten (10) calendar days in advance of the end of the Subscription Term i.e. prior to the commencement of the next Renewal Term for a monthly Subscription Plan, or within the notice period required by applicable Law, of a new subscription fee in which case the new subscription fee will apply to the Renewal Term. **You can cancel your Subscription Plan at any time via your User Account settings and your Subscription Plan will terminate upon the expiry of the then-current Subscription Term**.

A Subscription Plan is connected to a single Workspace. After subscribing to a Subscription Plan to one or more Workspaces, a User may continue to have multiple Workspaces subscribed to a Free Plan.

Subscription Plans are being charged based on the number of Seats and number of Workspaces with Extra Features within such Subscription Plan.

Any statutory rights you may have under the applicable Laws to terminate your Services at an earlier time during the Subscription Plan or any given Renewal Term remains unaffected by this clause, and, if required by applicable Law, we will send you a reminder notice prior to the commencement date of the Renewal Term (and in accordance with the notice periods specified in this Agreement or other such deadline set by applicable Law that may apply to you) reminding you of your right to terminate the affected Services and how to do so.

Subscription Plans for our Services are charged either monthly or annually (your Subscription Term), at your selection. All payments for the Subscription Plan are due in full, and in advance, no later than the first day of the applicable Subscription Term.

15\. PROMOTIONAL TRIAL-PERIODS (FREE TRIAL)
-------------------------------------------

CAKE.com may offer a free trial period ("**Free Trial**") of any or part of our Services. If User registers for a Free Trial, CAKE.com will make the applicable Service(s) available to User on a trial basis free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the Free Trial period for which User registered to use the applicable Service(s), or (b) the start date of any Subscription Plan ordered by User for such Service(s), or (c) termination by CAKE.com in its sole discretion.

CAKE.com reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the eligibility of a User for a Free Trial as well as to determine whether to revoke any such Free Trial. Free Trial Users may, at any time choose not to continue to a Subscription Plan by cancelling before the end of the Free Trial. If you do not cancel, at the end of your Free Trial, your User Account will be automatically subscribed to the applicable Subscription Plan, and you hereby authorize CAKE.com to charge your designated account at the rates in effect at that time. TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AND AVOID BEING CHARGED, YOU MUST CANCEL BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD.

CAKE.com may require a User to have a valid payment instrument, such as a credit card or other permitted payment method, before using the Free Trial. In this case, we may validate that payment method, including by requesting a temporary authorization from the financial institution issuing your payment instrument. If we determine that your payment instrument is invalid, without limiting any of our other rights, we may revoke any benefits you may have received as part of the Free Trial.

Any data User enters into the Services, and any customizations made to the Services by or for User, during User's Free Trial will be permanently lost unless User purchases a subscription to the same Services as those covered by the trial, purchases applicable upgraded Services, or exports such data, before the end of the Free Trial period. User cannot transfer data entered or customizations made during the Free Trial to a Service that would be a downgrade from that covered by the trial; therefore, if User purchases a Service that would be a downgrade from that covered by the trial, User must export User data before the end of the trial period or User data will be permanently lost.

Free Trials are available to new Enterprises only i.e. to Enterprises which create a User Account within our Services for the first time.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE "DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES" SECTION, "LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY" SECTION AND "INDEMNIFICATION" SECTION BELOW, DURING THE FREE TRIAL THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY AND CAKE.COM SHALL HAVE NO INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS NOR LIABILITY OF ANY TYPE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES FOR THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD UNLESS SUCH EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW IN WHICH CASE CAKE.COM'S LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES PROVIDED DURING THE FREE TRIAL SHALL NOT EXCEED $100.00. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, CAKE.COM AND ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO USER THAT: (A) USER'S USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD WILL MEET USER'S REQUIREMENTS, (B) USER'S USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR, AND (C) USAGE DATA PROVIDED DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD WILL BE ACCURATE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE "LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY" SECTION BELOW, USER SHALL BE FULLY LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO CAKE.COM AND ITS AFFILIATES FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF USER'S USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD, ANY BREACH BY USER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF USER'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.

USER SHALL REVIEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE'S DOCUMENTATION DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE.

16\. USERS OF PREVIOUS PLANS
----------------------------

This section applies to the Users who have subscribed to a particular Product and have continued to use Product per any of the paid plans that are no longer offered on Product (the "**Previous Plans**").

These Users are entitled to continue to use the Product Services under one of the Previous Plans and the previous version of this Agreement shall remain applicable to such Users in sections which define Previous Plan, the subscription and payment for such plans. In all other aspects, the current version of this Agreement will be applicable.

If the User decides to cancel their subscription to one of the Previous Plans or delete the User Account on the particular Product, from the moment of cancellation or deletion of the User Account, the User will not be able to subscribe to any of the Previous Plans anymore, but only to the available plans within the current Price Plan.

The User may not upgrade or downgrade any Previous Plans, except for the previous enterprise plan in which the User may freely change the number of Seats.

Notwithstanding the provisions in this Section, CAKE.com retains the sole and exclusive right to cancel Previous Plans at any time.

17\. PAYMENT
------------

**17.1 Charges**. You hereby authorize CAKE.com to charge to your designated account, relating to the Services and Subscription Plan you select, and you agree to pay all such fees in U.S. dollars (USD), Euro (EUR) or Swiss francs (CHF), depending on the territory where you are domiciled and where is your official business address, and in accordance with this Agreement. You agree that CAKE.com may charge your credit card, debit card, or other payment mechanism selected by you and approved by CAKE.com ("**Payment Method**") for all amounts due and owing in connection with your use of the Services, as ordered by or for you through the Services, including set up fees, one-time fees, non-recurring fees, overages, per-use charges, subscription fees, recurring fees, and any other fees and charges associated with the Services or your account ("**Charges**").

All payments are handled by a third-party payment processor. CAKE.com is not responsible for the processing of your payment and shall not be liable for any matter in connection therewith.

All Charges and sums payable to CAKE.com and all payments for the Subscription Plan hereunder shall be paid in full, and in advance of the Subscription Term, by the first day of the billing period, without deducting or allowing the deduction of any currency conversion, wire transfer, remittance, applicable tax, or other charges related to the payment. As provided in Section 18, all Charges are exclusive of any VAT or other taxes and public duties, except where CAKE.com has explicitly stated to the contrary. It is each User's responsibility to bear all public duties related to the purchase of the Service.

You agree to promptly update your Payment Method to allow for timely payment. Changes made to your Payment Method will not affect Charges that CAKE.com submits to your chosen Payment Method before CAKE.com could reasonably act on your changes. Additionally, you agree to permit CAKE.com to use any updated Payment Method information provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network and to charge your current primary Payment Method by using the details of such Payment Method saved in our system, even if such Payment Method is declined. CAKE.com further reserves the right to use your backup Payment Method to the extent one is provided. By adding a backup Payment Method, you authorize CAKE.com to process any applicable Charges on your backup Payment Method if your primary Payment Method is declined.

User must keep all the billing data in the User Account complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date). If User fails to provide or properly update any of the foregoing information, User agrees that CAKE.com may continue charging for the Services unless User has terminated the Subscription Plan as set forth herein and that User is still liable for the amounts charged. If your default Payment Method is declined for any reason, we may at our sole discretion, deny access to the Subscription Plan immediately.

**17.2 Payment Authorization and Payment Roles.** Anyone who subscribes to our Services, including anyone who has permitted or caused another person or Enterprise to participate in a Subscription Plan or who permits or causes another person to make an order on their behalf, is deemed to have agreed to and accepted liability for the payments under such Subscription Plan. The same rules will apply to anyone who permits to be designated as a payer for a Subscription Plan.

For the purpose of this Agreement, all Business Users and Authorized Users are categorized as Owners or Admins, according to their payment roles, whereas Business Users are designated as Owners and Authorized Users are designated as Admins.

Business User, who on behalf of an Enterprise, owns or manages a Workspace ("**Owner**") is entitled to authorize and make payments to CAKE.com for all amounts due and owing in connection with your use of the Services. Additionally, each Authorized User, as an end user who has been invited, permitted, or caused to have access to a shared Workspace by a Business User, and who uses our Services based on the license lawfully obtained by the Enterprise ("**Admin**") is entitled to authorize and make payments to CAKE.com independently, for all amounts due and owing in connection with your use of the Services.

Upon designation as an Authorized User by a Business User, Authorized User as Admin is granted authority for independent payment authorization and payment execution and is deemed to have agreed to and accepted liability for the payments under the respective Subscription Plan and to have agreed to and accepted to be designated as a payer for the Subscription Plan. Authorized User or Admin is entitled to perform and execute all required payments to CAKE.com, on an individual basis, solely and independently.

Each Authorized User and Business User is entitled and authorized to use the Payment Method which is already designated and selected by other Authorized Users and Business Users and approved by CAKE.com, and is entitled and authorized to use all related payment data relating to inserted credit cards, debit cards, or other payment mechanism selected by Authorized Users and Business Users and approved by CAKE.com, for the purpose of performing and executing all required payments to CAKE.com.

**17.2 Non-Cancellable and Non-Refundable Charges**. You agree that all payments are non-cancellable for the Initial Subscription Term or the then-current Renewal Term, as applicable, and are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise agreed to by CAKE.com or required by applicable Law.

If this Agreement or a Subscription Plan is terminated or varied during a certain Subscription Term, the User shall not be entitled to any refund concerning that Subscription Term. In addition, payments made for future Subscription Terms will not be refunded unless the Parties explicitly agree otherwise.

Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to automatically renew your subscription, you understand it will automatically renew, and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable Law) to collect the then-applicable Charges and any taxes using any payment method we have for you.

**17.3 Changes to Pricing**. Prices set out in the Price Plan are subject to change at any time and CAKE.com may change prices for the Services at any time, in its sole discretion. For changes to your Charges, CAKE.com will provide you with not less than (i) seven (7) calendar days prior notice, or (ii) the time period prescribed by applicable Law (each, (i) and (ii), a "**Rate Change Notice**"). Rate Change Notice may be sent to you by email to your most recently provided email address or posted on the CAKE.com website or on the Services or by any other manner chosen by CAKE.com in its commercially reasonable discretion. You will be deemed to have received any such notice that is posted on the CAKE.com website or on the Services on the day following the date it was posted.

To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any changes to your Charges will become binding on the Enterprise upon the following conditions: (i) CAKE.com has sent Rate Change Notice in advance of any such change; (ii) the Enterprise did not unsubscribe from the Subscription Plan within a Rate Change Notice period or by the end of the then-current Subscription Term, whichever date is later.

Unless the Parties explicitly agree otherwise, any changes to your Charges will be effective upon the commencement of your next Renewal Term or other date calculated in accordance with applicable Law. If you seek to terminate or modify the Services affected by a Rate Change Notice, then you must terminate or modify your affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period or by the end of the then-current Subscription Term. If you do not terminate or modify the affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period or by the end of the then-current Subscription Term, then you shall be deemed to have automatically accepted the change to your Charges, unless your affirmative, express consent to such change is required under applicable Law.

18\. TAXES
----------

**18.1 Taxes and Fees**. Unless otherwise expressly specified by CAKE.com as required by applicable Law, all prices shown by CAKE.com and Charges for the Services on your account are exclusive of Taxes and Fees. Where applicable, Taxes and Fees will be charged on the invoices issued by CAKE.com in accordance with applicable Laws. CAKE.com, in its sole discretion, will (i) calculate the amount of Taxes and Fees due, and (ii) change such amounts without notice to you.

**18.2 VAT Invoices**. If required by Law, CAKE.com will issue a VAT invoice, or a document that the relevant taxing authority will treat as a VAT invoice, to you. You agree that this invoice may be issued electronically.

**18.3 Tax Exemptions**. If you are exempt from any Taxes and Fees, you will provide CAKE.com with all appropriate tax exemption certificates, and/or other documentation satisfactory to the applicable taxing authorities, to substantiate such exemption status. CAKE.com reserves the right to review and validate tax exemption documentation. If the tax exemption documentation is not provided or not valid, CAKE.com reserves the right to charge applicable Taxes and Fees to you.

**18.4 Payment of Taxes and Withholding**. You will pay CAKE.com, and you are solely responsible for, any applicable Taxes and Fees. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees, as may be required by applicable Law. If any such deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees (including domestic or cross-border withholding taxes) are required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as necessary, such that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement. You also agree to provide CAKE.com with withholding tax certificates, upon CAKE.com's request, to the extent a withholding certificate is required to be sent to CAKE.com under applicable Law, and you agree that CAKE.com may provide your withholding tax certificate to the appropriate taxing authority without further notice to you.

**18.5 Value-Added Tax – Customer Obligations**. If Taxes and Fees are due towards the taxing authorities by you instead of CAKE.com, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you will provide CAKE.com with all appropriate evidence for CAKE.com to demonstrate your business nature, such as a valid VAT registration number (or similar information required under the relevant VAT Laws). CAKE.com reserves the right to review and validate your VAT registration number. If the VAT registration number is not valid, CAKE.com reserves the right to nevertheless charge the applicable VAT to you. For the avoidance of doubt, if VAT is due by you to a taxing authority, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you are solely responsible for paying those amounts to the relevant taxing authority, such that CAKE.com receives the full amount of payment required.

**18.6 Tax Determination**. Tax determination is principally based on the location where you have established your business based on your User Data. This location will be defined by CAKE.com as your ‘Sold To' address. CAKE.com reserves the right to cross reference this location against other available evidence to validate whether your location is accurate. If your location is inaccurate, CAKE.com reserves the right to charge you any outstanding Taxes and Fees.

**18.7 Use and Enjoyment**. If you subscribe to any Services, and those Services are used and enjoyed by a subsidiary of you in a country that is different from your location as determined pursuant to Section 18.6, you confirm that, where required, you will treat this as a supply to your subsidiary. If you subscribe to the Services and those Services are used and enjoyed by a branch or a subsidiary of you in a country that is different to your location as determined pursuant to Section 18.6, you acknowledge that you will inform CAKE.com of the Services that have been allocated, and you acknowledge that CAKE.com reserves the right to charge Taxes and Fees based on the use and enjoyment of those Services.

**18.8 Disclosures to Taxing Authorities**. In accordance with applicable tax Law, and notwithstanding any of CAKE.com's notice obligations that may arise under this Agreement, we may disclose User information, including User Confidential Information, to a tax authority without notice to you before or after the disclosure.

19\. UPGRADING OR DOWNGRADING PLAN
----------------------------------

You may upgrade your plan at any time via your User Account. If you upgrade your plan to include Extra Features or additional Extra Features, you will be immediately charged for the chosen upgrade, on a pro rata basis, and initiate a new Subscription Term. If you upgrade from a monthly Subscription Term to an annual Subscription Term, you will be immediately charged for and initiate the annual Subscription Term on an ongoing basis. If you upgrade your plan to include additional Seats, you will be charged for the new Seats on a pro rata basis for the then-current Subscription Term and the total (increased) number of Seats for the next Subscription Term.

You may downgrade your Subscription Plan or downgrade to a Free Plan at any time via your User Account settings, and your plan will change upon the expiry of the then-current Subscription Term, with limited exceptions.

If you would like to reduce or eliminate the number of Extra Features on your plan, after your then-current Subscription Term expires, your access to the Extra Features offered in the current Subscription Plan will be denied, and you will be charged for the downgraded Subscription Plan, based on the Subscription Term you choose. If you would like to change from an annual plan to a monthly plan, after your annual Subscription Term expires, you will be charged for the monthly Subscription Term. If you would like to reduce the number of Seats on you plan, after your then-current Subscription Term expires, you will be charged based on the new number of Seats for the next Subscription Term. There will be no refund for any reduction of the number of Extra Features or Seats during the then-current Subscription Term. Any reduction of Extra Feature or Seats will occur effective in the subsequent Renewal Term.

If you change from an annual Subscription Plan to a monthly Subscription Plan with additional Extra Features, you will obtain immediate access to the additional Extra Features in the upgraded Subscription Plan. The previous payment made for the annual plan will be calculated on a pro rata basis and, depending on the balance, you may obtain credit, or you may be charged immediately for the outstanding payment for the monthly Subscription Plan. In the event you have the remaining credit, such credit may be applied against the amounts payable for the next Subscription Term. No refunds will be provided.

THESE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES AND LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABLE DAMAGES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, OBLIGATIONS, AND LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), STATUTE, CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF CAKE.COM, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL CAKE.COM PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AND EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

In the event that any of the foregoing limitations are deemed unenforceable or in the event any liability of the CAKE.com Parties is established, to the greatest extent permitted by the applicable Law, the total aggregate liability of the CAKE.com Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to our Services and this Agreement, under any and all circumstances and regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the amount paid by you to use our Services in the preceding twelve (12) months and may not exceed an annual license fee for the Server Plan paid by the User.

You agree that this limitation of liability represents a reasonable allocation of risk and is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between CAKE.com and you. You understand that the Services would not be provided without such limitations.

The limitations set forth in this Section 29 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud, or intentional and wilful misconduct of the CAKE.com Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under the applicable Law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. Accordingly, since some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions of damages or limitations on liability, the above limitation only applies to you to the extent that the exclusions of damages or limitations on liability are not prohibited under the applicable Law.

30\. INDEMNIFICATION
--------------------

To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold the CAKE.com and its affiliates and each of our licensors and suppliers ("**Indemnified Parties**") harmless, including any officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, consultants, and agents of the Indemnified Parties, from any and all third party allegations, losses, liabilities, claims, proceeding, demands, damages, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) ("**Claims**") arising out of or related to your (including any End Users, Business Users, Authorized Users, or third parties using credentials provided to the Enterprise): (i) access to or use of the Services, Software or any Add-Ons; (ii) User Content or Feedback; (iii) breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable Law; (iv) violation, misappropriation, or infringement or violation of any Proprietary Rights or other right of any person or entity (including Intellectual Property Rights or privacy rights); (v) conduct in connection with the Services or Software; (vi) relationship with your End Users, Business Users or Authorized Users or any dispute between you and your End User, Business User or Authorized User, or (vii) a personal injury or property damage to a third party relating to your or your End User\`s, Business User\`s or Authorized User's acts or omissions. We will provide you and you will provide us prompt notice of any third-party Claims against the Indemnified Parties, and you will cooperate with the Indemnified Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs, and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys' fees). You also agree that the Indemnified Parties will have control of the defence or settlement, at the Indemnified Parties' sole option, of any third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and the Indemnified Parties.

31\. TERMINATION

This Agreement shall continue until either:

1. you cancel your Subscription Plan (where applicable) and request for your User Account and all of your Workspaces to be deactivated and deleted; or

**31.2 Effect of Termination or Suspension**.

Upon any termination of this Agreement, you must cease any further use of the Services. No expiration or termination of this Agreement will affect your obligation to pay all Charges that may have become due before such expiration or termination, including that CAKE.com may retain any Charges previously paid by you if this Agreement is terminated, unless prohibited by applicable Law. If your Services are suspended for your failure to comply with this Agreement, you will be liable for all Charges due and owing during the period of suspension.

**31.3 Termination by User**

User of our Services may terminate this Agreement by deleting the User Account.

You may cancel your Subscription Plan at any time via your applicable User Account.

Your cancellation will be effective at the end of your then-current Subscription Term for each applicable Service i.e. on the last day of the then-current Subscription Term, subject to applicable Law, and you may use the Services until your cancellation is effective (unless your access is suspended or terminated in accordance with this Agreement or applicable Law).

In relation to Product Servers, CAKE.com has no means or powers to provide the End User with the possibility to close the User Account. If you are an End User, please contact the Client regarding this matter.

You understand that cessation of use of the Services will not qualify as termination or entitle you to any refund. If you do not want to use the Services, you need to cancel the subscription to any Subscription Plan and either switch to a Free Plan or delete the User Account.

User is aware and accepts that closing the User Account does not necessarily mean that all Workspaces the User had access to will be automatically deleted. The same rule applies to the User Content provided by that User. User space may belong to other Users, and it is in those Users' responsibility.

You may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination if CAKE.com has materially breached this Agreement and has not cured such material breach within thirty (30) business days of CAKE.com's receipt of your written notice of such breach. Your notice shall state the specific provision in this Agreement that you contend CAKE.com has breached and set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances you allege provide the basis for such breach.

**31.4 Termination by CAKE.com**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, CAKE.com reserves the right to change, edit, delete, and/or cancel any part of our Services, and/or immediately suspend your access to the Services or may terminate this Agreement effective immediately, and/or your permission to use the Services, any Add-Ons, or any portion of the foregoing immediately, without prior notice or liability if, in our sole discretion: (i) you commit any breach of this Agreement or Add-On terms and conditions and if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any referenced policies, guides, notices, or statements; (ii) you do not pay the Charges when due in accordance with your Subscription Plan; (iii) you violate the rights of CAKE.com or any third party, or are otherwise inappropriate; (iv) we discontinue the Services; (v) we are prevented from providing the Services for any reason; (vi) if required by the applicable Law; (vii) due to an event beyond our reasonable control; or (viii) there is a change, cancellation, or revocation of approval by any applicable App Store Provider.

If CAKE.com chooses to suspend your Services and the failure to comply continues, CAKE.com may exercise any or all of its termination rights in this Section 31.

Additionally, CAKE.com may terminate the Services and/or terminate this Agreement, at its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, upon thirty (30) business days' advance notice, i.e. after the expiry of thirty (30) business days from the day the notice of such termination is sent to User.

**31.5 User Data Download and Deletion; Access to User Content After Termination**

In the event you wish to delete your User Account, you may be able to download the information provided, inputted, or uploaded to our Services.

At the moment, if you delete your User Account, User Data on your User Account will be deleted immediately. Nevertheless, time tracked, projects, and other information can be deleted only by deleting a Workspace. You understand that only the owner of a Workspace is entitled to decide on the User Data on that Workspace and may delete, edit, or keep such data regardless of any User's activity on our Services.

For thirty (30) calendar days following expiration or termination of this Agreement, CAKE.com will provide you access to retrieve your User Content, after which time your User Content will be deleted according to applicable Law, this Agreement, and our regularly scheduled deletion protocols, policies, and procedures. All access during the period set forth in this Section 31 is provided to you subject to and governed by this Agreement.

32\. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
----------------------------------

We may provide information about third-party products, services, activities, or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through the Services (collectively, "**Third-Party Content**"). We provide Third-Party Content as a service to those interested in such content. Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction with any Third-Party Content are solely between you and the third party. CAKE.com does not control or endorse, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content, and your access to and use of such Third-Party Content is at your own risk.

33\. JURISDICTION AND CHOICE OF LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION
-------------------------------------------------------

**33.1 Governing LawandJurisdiction.** The laws of the State of California, U.S.A., regardless of conflict of laws principles, govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement, except that the Federal Arbitration Act governs provisions relating to arbitration.

The foregoing choice of governing law will not deprive you of the protection afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the Laws applicable to you.

**33.2 Dispute Resolution. Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with CAKE.com and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.**

* **No Representative Actions. You and CAKE.com agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or our Services is between you and CAKE.com and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.**
* **Arbitration of Disputes.** Except for small claims disputes, as defined under the applicable Law, in which you or CAKE.com seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or CAKE.com seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, **you and CAKE.com waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, "Dispute(s)"), resolved in court**. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against CAKE.com you agree to first contact CAKE.com and attempt to resolve the claim informally and amicably, through negotiations, by sending a written notice of your claim ("**Notice**") to CAKE.com by email at [\[email protected\]](https://clockify.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by certified mail addressed to CAKE.com Inc, 2100 GENG RD STE 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA. The Notice must (i) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and CAKE.com cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS Mediation, Arbitration and ADR Services ("**JAMS**") or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Santa Clara County in the State of California. You and CAKE.com agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("**JAMS Rules**"). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules is available on the [JAMS website](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
* You and CAKE.com agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of this Section 33 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, _et seq_. (the "**FAA**"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement, and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one Enterprise's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one Enterprise.
* The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, CAKE.com, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the Law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by Law or judicial decision.
* You and CAKE.com agree that the Party that initiates the arbitration shall pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and CAKE.com agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in Santa Clara County in the State of California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
* Any Dispute will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of California, except to the extent pre-empted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the Parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in Santa Clara County in the State of California and the Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts located in and serving Santa Clara County, California, and the federal courts in the State of California. Notwithstanding the above, you and CAKE.com agree that this paragraph does not preclude either you or us from initiating any proceedings (including nullity proceedings) before the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Boards (TTAB), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the United States Copyright Office, or any foreign patent, trademark, or copyright office, as long as any such proceeding relates to the validity, enforceability, or unenforceability of any copyright, patent, trademark, or other Intellectual Property Rights or Proprietary Rights owned or assigned to either you or CAKE.com.
* **Any Dispute must be filed within one (1) year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and CAKE.com will not have the right to assert the claim and initiate any proceeding therewith.**
* If any portion of this Section 33 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 33 or the Parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 33; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the Parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 33 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 33 will be enforceable.

* use Server Products for more End Users than agreed in this Agreement with CAKE.com;

**Delivery.** CAKE.com shall provide the Server Products and documentation to Client, through a reasonable system of electronic download or otherwise agreed between the Parties, within 10 calendar days after the payment has been received by CAKE.com.

**Documentation.** Upon delivery of the Server Products, CAKE.com shall also deliver copies of the necessary documentation.

The Client is not entitled to engage a third party to provide maintenance services on Server Products.

**Updates.** The Client will sometimes need software updates to keep using Server Products. CAKE.com may automatically check the Client's version of the Server Products and deploy software updates or configuration changes.

**C. Payment for Server Products**

**Fees for Server Plan.** Server Plan is only available as an annual plan and the applicable fees are being charged annually. The applicable fees are being charged based on the number of End Users as agreed between the Client and CAKE.com based on CAKE.com's offer.

The fees for the next billing period are due 30 days before the expiry of the then-current billing period.

Reduction in the number of End Users during the billing period does not entitle the Client to a refund for that billing period.

An increase in the number of End Users after the beginning of a billing cycle will be charged on a pro rata basis to match the end date of the then-current billing period.

The Client acknowledges that payment for the Product Services is non-refundable for a certain billing period if this Agreement is terminated any time after such billing period has started.

**Fees for Additional Service.** Fees for Additional Service is being charged as agreed between the Client and CAKE.com based on CAKE.com's offer.

Amounts due under this Agreement or any agreement for the Additional Service with Client are payable to CAKE.com without deduction and net of any taxes, tariff, duty, or assessment imposed by any government authority (national, state, provincial, or local), including, without limitation, any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, property, withholding, or value-added tax withheld at the source. If the applicable Law requires withholding or deduction of such taxes or duties, Client shall separately pay CAKE.com the withheld or deducted amount. However, the preceding two sentences do not apply to taxes based on CAKE.com's net income.

**D. Confidential Information**

**Confidential Information.** "**Confidential Information**" refers to the following information that one party to this Agreement ("**Discloser**") discloses to the other ("**Recipient**"): (a) any document Discloser marks "Confidential"; (b) any information Discloser orally designates as "Confidential" at the time of disclosure; (c) any object code and source code disclosed by CAKE.com together with all documentation and any names of actual or potential customers disclosed by Client, whether or not marked as confidential; and (d) any other non-public, sensitive information. Recipient should reasonably consider a trade secret or otherwise confidential. Quotation offered by CAKE.com for the license to use Server Products or for the customization services will at all times be considered confidential.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is in Recipient's possession at the time of disclosure; (ii) is independently developed by Recipient without the use of or reference to Confidential Information; (iii) becomes known publicly, before or after disclosure, other than as a result of Recipient's improper action or inaction; or (iv) is approved for release in writing by Discloser.

**Nondisclosure.** The Recipient shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than to facilitate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "**Purpose**") during the term of this Agreement and 10 years after its termination (regardless of the ground for termination). Recipient: (i) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any employee or contractor of Recipient unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the Purpose and executes a nondisclosure agreement with Recipient with terms no less restrictive than those contained herein; and (ii) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without Discloser's prior written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Recipient shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information as required by the applicable Law or by proper legal or governmental authority. The Recipient shall give Discloser prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Discloser in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at Discloser's expense.

**E. Representations, Warranties, and Limitation of Liability**

From CAKE.com:

* **Function.** CAKE.com represents and warrants that, during the term of this Agreement, the Server Products will perform materially as described herein and in the Server Products documentation.
* **Intellectual Property Rights in the Software.** Subject to the next sentence, CAKE.com represents and warrants that it is the owner of the Software and each and every component thereof, or the recipient of a valid license thereto, and that it has and will maintain the full power and authority to grant the Intellectual Property Rights to the Software set forth in this Agreement without the further consent of any third party.

From both Parties:

* Each Party represents and warrants that it has the full right and authority to enter into, execute, and perform its obligations under this Agreement and that no pending or threatened claim or litigation known to it would have a material adverse impact on its ability to perform as required by this Agreement.

**Warranty Disclaimers.** Except for the express warranties directly above, CAKE.COM MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE.

CAKE.com does not warrant that the Server Products will perform without error or that they will run without immaterial interruption. CAKE.com provides no warranty regarding, and will have no responsibility for, any claim arising out of:

* modification or maintenance of the Server Products made by anyone other than CAKE.com, unless CAKE.com approves such modification in writing; or
* use of the Server Products in combination with any operating system not authorized in documentation or with hardware or software specifically forbidden by documentation.

**Exclusion of Liability for Data Security.** Given that, in case of Server Products, all the User Content is hosted on the Client's server or server chosen by the Client, the security of the Client's data and the User Content and application of the physical, technical, administrative, organizational and other measures is in the Client's full responsibility. CAKE.com may not be held liable for data security in relation to the User Content and Client's data nor accountable for any security data breach, unauthorized access, use, disclosure or any other illegal activity related to the User Content and Client's data (including personal data of End Users) unless otherwise explicitly agreed between the Parties and in line with provisions of [Data Processing Addendum](https://clockify.me/dpa), which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement and forms integral part of this Agreement. The limitations set forth in this Section 34 will not limit or exclude liability for gross negligence, fraud, or intentional and wilful misconduct of the CAKE.com Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under the applicable Law. Accordingly, since some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability, the above exclusion only applies to you to the extent that the exclusions or limitations of liability are not prohibited under the applicable Law.

CAKE.COM'S AGGREGATE AND TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NOT EXCEED AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE FOR THE SERVER PLAN PAID BY THE CLIENT.

**F. Termination and License Term**

**Termination.** This Agreement will continue until terminated by either Party as specifically authorized herein.

**License Term.** The license term starts on the date the Client downloads Server Products and lasts for one year period (the "**License Term**"). The License Term will renew automatically for periods of the same duration unless the Client gives written notice of its intent not to renew 30 days before the end of the current License Term.

**Termination for Cause.** Either Party may terminate this Agreement for the other's material breach by written notice specifying in detail the nature of the breach, effective in thirty (30) calendar days unless the other Party first cures such breach, or effective immediately if the breach is not subject to cure.

**Effects of Termination.** Upon termination of this Agreement or License Term, Client shall cease all use of the Server Products and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Server Products and documentation in its possession or control. Client admits and acknowledges that any use after the license has expired shall constitute a breach of CAKE.com's Intellectual Property Rights and will entitle CAKE.com, inter alia, to the full compensation of copyright infringement damages.

Without prejudice to the previous paragraph of this Section 34, the license for Server Products and this Agreement will immediately terminate if Client has failed to make payment prior to the beginning of the billing period and does not make such payment within 5 working days after CAKE.com gives notice of such nonpayment to Client.

Upon termination of the license to use Server Products for whatever reason, Client is obliged to delete Software and the Content from all the devices, prevent all End Users who have been using Server Products via license obtained by Client and present CAKE.com with the proof of cessation of all activities authorized by this Agreement.

The Client understands and agrees that upon any termination of this Agreement:

* Client must cease all activities authorized by this Agreement;
* all amounts (if any) owed to CAKE.com hereunder become due;
* all User Data and other information associated with the Client's Account may be deleted, or may become inaccessible to User;
* all its Software-related Client's obligations hereunder shall survive until Client has fully removed all Software from its devices, systems and storage media.

The Client has to send a written statement to CAKE.com that Software has been permanently deleted and that Client ceased using Software. However, the Client may export and save the User Data or User Content via an "export" option offered at Software prior to the termination date. Until CAKE.com receives such a written statement from the Client, it shall be deemed that the Client is using Software.

37\. MISCELLANEOUS
------------------

**37.1 Language and Translations**. All notices and communications under this Agreement must be provided in the English language. If we provide a translation of the English-language version of this Agreement, then the English-language version of this Agreement controls and prevails in the event of conflict, discrepancy, or inconsistency.

**37.2 Merger; Integration**; **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement (as amended and updated from time to time) including any agreements incorporated by reference herein, constitutes and embodies the entire and final agreement between you and CAKE.com relating to the subject matter hereof and contains the complete and exclusive expression of your and our agreement pertaining to its subject matter. All prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, writings, negotiations, and discussions between you and CAKE.com with respect to the subject matter hereof are expressly merged into and superseded by this Agreement. We expressly object to and do not agree to any terms and conditions presented by you that are in addition to or different from those contained in this Agreement. You acknowledge that no terms and conditions presented by you that purport to add to, modify, or vary the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be binding on us, including (i) text or information set forth on any purchase order, email correspondence, invoice or invoice process, or preprinted form, or (ii) terms and conditions of any request for proposal, request for bid, request for information, or questionnaire. In entering into this Agreement, neither you nor CAKE.com has relied upon any statement, representation, warranty, or agreement of the other party except to the extent expressly contained in this Agreement. In case of conflict between any provision herein and any statement, representation, or other information published on the Services or contained in any other materials or communications, the provision in this Agreement shall prevail.

**37.3 No Agency Relationship**. CAKE.com and you are independent contractors and do not intend to create an express or implied agency relationship by entering into this Agreement, whether arising under federal or state common law of agency.

**37.4 No Third-Party Rights or Remedies**. This Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any enforceable rights or remedies upon any person other than CAKE.com and you.

**37.5 Notices**. CAKE.com may give notice to you by (i) electronic mail to your email address on record in your account information, which is associated with your User Account, (ii) written communication sent by mail or courier to the address provided by the applicable Business User or Authorized User i.e. by letter delivered by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, or (iii) first-class postage prepaid mail to your address on record in your account information. You are responsible for ensuring that your email address and property address on record are current. You agree that any notice sent to the then-current email or property address in our systems is adequate and binding notice upon you. You will provide notice to us (such notice is deemed given when received by CAKE.com) by electronic mail or by letter delivered by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first-class postage prepaid mail.

All notices to CAKE.com shall be provided to [\[email protected\]](https://clockify.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or 2100 Geng Road, Suite 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA.

Notice shall be deemed to have been received the next day if given via notice through a User Account or via email, or five (5) business days after posting the notice via courier or registered post.

**37.6 Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by any court having competent jurisdiction, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way and the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. You and CAKE.com intend that any invalid, illegal, or unenforceable portions of this Agreement will be interpreted to provide the greatest effect and intent of the original. If a construction of the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable portion is not possible, the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable portion will be severed from this Agreement and the rest of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

If any provision of this Agreement violates any mandatory rule of applicable Law and proves to be void as a result thereof, such provision shall, for those specific circumstances and only in that particular respect in which it is void, be deemed to have been amended to comply with the Law. Any such amendment shall be confined to the minimum necessary to make the provision valid and shall retain as much of its original ambit and meaning as possible.

**37.7 Survival**. All sections of this Agreement which, by their nature should survive termination or expiration, will survive, including sections pertaining to confidential information, CAKE.com's Proprietary Rights, license rights granted by you to CAKE.com, payment obligations, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, arbitration, and the limitation on liability.

**37.8 No Waiver**. CAKE.com's failure to exercise any right or enforce any condition or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision and does not operate as a current or future waiver. For any waiver to be effective against us, the waiver must be in a writing signed by CAKE.com's duly authorized representative.

**37.9 Interpretation**. Any heading, caption, or section title contained herein is for convenience only, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision. All terms defined in the singular will have the same meanings when used in the plural and vice versa, where appropriate and unless otherwise specified. Any use of the term "e.g." or "including" or variations thereof in this Agreement will be construed as if followed by the phrase "without limitation."

**37.10 Assignment; Successors and Assigns**. You may not assign your rights or transfer any of your obligations under this Agreement to any other party without our prior express written consent. Such consent may be withheld in our sole discretion, and any purported assignment or transfer without such consent and in violation of this section is null and void. We may assign our rights or transfer any or all of our obligations under this Agreement to any party at any time, without prior notice to you, (i) in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (ii) to our affiliate. This Agreement is binding upon, and inures to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective permitted successors, assigns, heirs, executors and beneficiaries.
