How do I enable or disable two-factor authentication (2FA)?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Two-factor authentication is a recommended security feature that can help protect your Sync account from unauthorized access. Enabling two-factor authentication means that the Sync apps and web panel will require an additional security code (along with your password ) when you sign in to your account or add a new computer or device.

You can enable two-factor authentication using a mobile authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator) or using email delivery.

* * *

**To enable or disable 2FA using email delivery (easiest):**

1. [Sign in to the web panel](https://cp.sync.com/account/security).
2. Click your **email address** (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar.
3. Select **Settings.**
4. Click the **Security** tab.
5. Click **Edit** beside two-factor authentication.
6. Click **Enable 2-FA via email** (or **Disable** to disable 2FA if you previously enabled it).
7. Be sure to download the **backup codes** and store them in a safe place. You can use each backup code once, in the event that you need to sign in and do not have access to your email.

2FA is now enabled. You will have to check your email address for the additional security code each time you sign in to the web panel or install Sync on a new computer or device.

* * *

**To enable 2FA using a mobile authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator):**

Before you begin you will need to download and install the Google Authenticator app on your phone or tablet. Get it on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.auth).

1. [Sign in to the web panel](https://cp.sync.com/account/security).
2. Click your **email address** (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar.
3. Select **Settings.**
4. Click the **Security** tab.
5. Click **Edit** beside two-factor authentication.
6. Click **Enable 2-FA via Google Authenticator**. Note: if 2FA is currently set to Email, click **Disable** and then click **Edit** again to Enable 2-FA via Google Authenticator.
7. Open the Google Authenticator app on your mobile device and tap **Scan a barcode**. You may have to tap **+** first, if you’ve already set up the app with other services.
8. Scan the QR code displayed on the Sync web panel, into the Google Authenticator app.
9. The Google Authenticator app will provide a 6-digit verification code. **Enter the verification code** on the Sync web panel and click **Save**.
10. Be sure to download the **backup codes** and store them in a safe place. You can use each backup code once, in the event that you do not have access to your mobile device.

2FA is now enabled. You will have to check the Google Authenticator app for the additional security code each time you sign in into the web panel or install Sync on a new computer or device.

* * *

How do I enable or disable single sign on (SSO)?
------------------------------------------------

Sync includes a single sign on feature, allowing you to automatically sign in to the web panel from an authenticated Sync desktop app installed on your computer.

Once you’ve installed the Sync desktop app you can click the **Sync icon** on the [Windows system tray](#syncapp) or the [Mac menu bar](#syncapp) and select the **Go to Sync.com web panel** quick link. This will sign you into the web panel automatically, as the desktop app has already been authenticated.

* * *

**To enable or disable single sign on:**

1. [Sign in to the web panel](https://cp.sync.com/account/security).
2. Click your **email address** (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar.
3. Select **Settings.**
4. Click the **Security** tab.
5. Click **Edit** beside single sign-on.
6. Enable or disable the option as needed and click the **Enable** or **Disable** button to confirm.

If SSO is disabled, you will be prompted to enter your username and password each time you access the web panel from the desktop app Go to Sync.com web panel quick link.

SSO does not override two-factor authentication. With 2FA enabled you will be prompted for an additional security code each time you sign in into the web panel, regardless of your SSO settings.
