**Automatically Collected Information**

When a User uses the Services or a visitor visits the Xello website, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about how such individuals interact with the Services (e.g., the pages viewed, the links clicked, and other actions taken on the Services) and usage of the Services over time. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Our servers automatically collect other information about Users or visitors that may include web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, cookie or device identifier, operating system, browser type, mobile device information. We may also collect analytics data about actions taken before or while using the Services, or use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. These analytics services help us understand how users arrive at and use our Services.We may also use third-party advertising partners on our public websites to advertise the Services on other sites. These tools may set and access their own cookies and similar technologies on our websites and on third-party services to collect information that can be used to track users over time and across services. We only use these on our business information websites and do not use these third-party advertising cookies on the services we provide to schools or students.

How We Use Information
----------------------

We use the information we collect, including Student Personal Information and User Content, to help Students create a successful future.

Specifically, we use such information to:

* provide, improve and analyze the Services;
* respond to questions, comments, and requests for information or provide customer support;
* comply with applicable law or legal process.
* detect, investigate and prevent activities that may be a violation of our [Terms of Service](https://xello.world/en/terms/) or law
* administer, troubleshoot and secure the Services;
* as directed or authorized by a School, District or Post Secondary School that has licensed and/or uses the Services  —including as described in more detail for the Higher Ed Platform below.

We do not sell or rent Student Personal Information or the User Content provided in the Services, including for the purpose of advertising. Nor do we disclose or provide any of the Student Personal Information or User Content provided to third parties for any purpose except as described in this Privacy Policy or directed by a School.

We do not serve third-party advertisements to you while using our Services. However, we do work with online advertising and analytics partners who may place cookies and similar technologies on our business information websites to deliver you more relevant Xello advertisements on third-party websites and to allow us to better tailor our own ads and communications on our Services. For example, they may use non-directly identifying information they collect from cookies on our business information websites to identify Xello services you might be interested in and to recognize your device so they can show you relevant Xello advertisements while you are using other services. Additionally, we may provide non-directly identifying information (such as “hashed” or encrypted versions of email addresses for customers or interested customers) to advertising and analytics partners, who may “match” this information in non-directly identifying form to cookies, mobile ad identifiers, and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other online services or analyze ad performance.  We do not use student information for such purposes. You can opt out of this use of cookies for personalized ads using the “Change Cookie Preferences” link in the footer of our website.

We use and share de-identified and aggregate information for a variety of purposes including improving the design, features, and functionality of the Services, for marketing purposes, for general business purposes, and for administrative purposes.

In addition to the above, we use School or School Authorized Administrator information to send information about features on the Services or changes to our policies and communicate with Schools about the Services, including your account, transactions with us and security alerts.

How We Disclose Information
---------------------------

We may disclose personal information in certain special cases, including the following:

* We are required to do so by law or as ordered by a court.
* To detect, investigate and prevent activities that may be a violation of our [Terms of Service](https://xello.world/en/terms/), our other agreements with you, or any laws; to respond to claims of violations of the rights of third parties; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Xello or others.
* To resolve a technical problem or secure the Services.
* As directed by a School or District that has licensed Xello.

We may permit certain trusted service providers and partners to analyze usage of the Services, as well as analyze information such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring website (if any), and other parameters in the URL. This is collected in order to better understand usage of our website and the Services and enhance the performance of and maintain and operate the Services. We may also use trusted service providers to host portions of the Services infrastructure, operate various features of the Services, store content, send emails, and store data on our behalf.  As described above, we also permit certain third-party advertising partners to collect information regarding visits to our business information websites to deliver relevant advertising about our Services.

We may also disclose personal information or User Content in connection with a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company (or in connection with related due diligence). In these circumstances, we will only disclose such information with a company that has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own and after providing advanced notice to you with an opportunity to opt out of our sharing of such information.

When a School turns on access to the Higher Ed Platform, Students may post questions and messages on a Post-Secondary School’s page within Xello, and Ambassadors and Staff may respond and post other information.  Such User Content will be visible to anyone who has access to the Post-Secondary School page within Xello.  When a School turns on access to the Higher Ed Platform, Students may also engage in one-to-one chat with Ambassadors or Post-Secondary Staff.  Participants in the one-to-one chat can view such messages.  Xello cannot control how others who view such posts or messages, or other User Content use and/or share those messages or User Content. 

For Schools that have turned on access to the Higher Ed Platform, Students may also choose to opt-in to “Profile Sharing” for one or more Post-Secondary Schools and the Post-Secondary School can view the Students’ profile information.  Please note, Students must opt in to Profile Sharing for each Post-Secondary School that they want to be able to view their information. Students can disable Profile Sharing at any time and Profile Sharing is turned off by default. Students in Schools who have not enabled the Community feature of the Higher Ed Platform cannot post on Post-Secondary Schools’ pages, engage in chats or opt in to Profile sharing.

When a School turns on access to Work-Based Learning, Students may apply for Work-Based Learning opportunities within Xello.  Work-Based Learning administrators can have access to Student name, grade, and school to facilitate Work-Based Learning opportunities.  Potential employers offering work-based learning will have access to Students’ applications and contact information in order to contact Students about their applications. 

Third-Party Services
--------------------

Certain third-party products or services (such as single sign on for test preparation services) may be available for Schools to choose to integrate within or use within the Services. A School is not required to use such additional products in the Services. Before electing to use such third-party services, Schools should review the terms, policies and practices of the third-party products and services to understand their terms and policies with respect to any personal information, including Student Personal Information, they may collect. We strive to make available third-party services that will be useful to Schools, but we are not responsible for their practices, including with respect to personal information.

How We Protect Information
--------------------------

We are committed to protecting personal information, including Student Personal Information, and User Content submitted to the Services. We have numerous systems in place to help safeguard against security breaches, denial of service attacks, and destruction of data. These measures include physical security and backups, employee restriction to data, and a comprehensive security breach policy.

All traffic transmitted to and from the Services is encrypted using Secure Socket Layers (SSL). We use industry-standard hashing mechanisms for sensitive data, such as passwords, and all backups are securely encrypted. Network infrastructure is monitored 24/7 by an intrusion detection system, while all servers use virus protection with full antivirus pattern updates. We maintain a detailed, and frequently tested, disaster recovery plan that includes multiple layers of redundancy in addition to a robust backup strategy.

Our employees who require access to personal information, including Student Personal Information, to perform their function must complete a criminal background check and sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to employment.

* For legal compliance;
* With consent; or
* Other grounds, as required or permitted by law in the specific respective context.

Location of Data Storage and Processing
---------------------------------------

Please note that data collected in the US, Canada and the UK will remain stored in the country of origin. Data collected from users in other countries will be stored in the country where the application originates. For example, if a user is accessing the US version of Xello, their data will be stored in the US.

In addition, in providing the Services, we may process your data in other jurisdictions where Xello (and its service providers) operates which includes the US, Canada and the UK. Please be aware that the privacy protections and legal requirements, including the rights of authorities to access your information, in these countries may not be equivalent to those in your country.

Children’s Privacy

In the United States, we are required under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose personal information from Children under the age of 13. As provided for by COPPA, we rely upon the School to obtain parental consent for the online collection of personal information from Children who are Students of such School.

Whistleblower Policy
--------------------

Xello is committed to the highest standards of openness and accountability. As a community we have a professional responsibility to speak up and report unethical behavior. If a Xellion (current or former), contractor, volunteer, or user/customer believes Xello, or a member of staff, has taken action that is of concern towards malpractice or impropriety, all reasonable steps should be taken to communicate concerns through appropriate channels. These concerns could include:

* Financial malpractice or impropriety or fraud
* Failure to comply with a legal obligation or Statutes
* Dangers to Health & Safety or the environment
* Criminal activity
* Improper conduct or unethical behavior
* Attempts to conceal any of these

All individuals who disclose such concerns will be protected provided the disclosure is made:

* in good faith
* in the reasonable belief of the individual making the disclosure that it tends to show malpractice or impropriety and if they make the disclosure to an appropriate person (see below). It is important to note that no protection from internal disciplinary procedures is offered to those who choose not to report through the identified channels.

Xello will treat all such disclosures in a confidential and sensitive manner. We will work to keep the identity of the individual making the allegation confidential so long as it does not hinder or frustrate any investigation. However, the investigation process may reveal the source of the information and the individual making the disclosure may need to provide a statement as part of the evidence required. An individual can disclose through the following designated channel: Confidential email submission – [cultureteam@xello.world](mailto:cultureteam@xello.world)
