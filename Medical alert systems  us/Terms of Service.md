### 7\. Dispute Resolution

  
7.1 General: If a dispute arises between you and MedicalAlertSystems, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and MedicalAlertSystems agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or our services (a “Claim”) in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation. Other than those matters listed in Section 7.2, you and MedicalAlertSystems agree to seek resolution of the dispute only through arbitration of that dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section 7, and not litigate any dispute in court. Arbitration means that the dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.  
  
7.2 Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR BY MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS RELATED TO PROTECTION OF MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS OR ANY MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS LICENSOR’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 7.  
  
7.3 RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION 7, YOU MUST NOTIFY MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS TERMS ADMINISTRATOR, 244 FIFTH AVE, SUITE 1628 NEW YORK, NY 10010 AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR EMAIL AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS THROUGH ARBITRATION.  
  
7.4 Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND MEDICALALERTSYSTEMS SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION.  
  
7.5 Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or MedicalAlertSystems elect to resolve your dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section 7 govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.  
  
7.6 Arbitration Procedures. Because the Service concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (“Supplementary Procedures”) shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with MedicalAlertSystems as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to MedicalAlertSystems or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.  
  
7.7 Location of Arbitration. You or MedicalAlertSystems may initiate arbitration in either Orange County, California or the county in which you reside. In the event that you select the county of your residence, MedicalAlertSystems may transfer the arbitration to Orange County, California in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as determined by the arbitrator  
  
7.8 Severability. If any clause within this Section 7 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause of Section 7.4) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 7, and the remainder of this Section 7 will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver (Section 7.4) clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 7 will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court and you and MedicalAlertSystems each agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.  
  
7.9 Continuation. . This Section 7 shall survive any termination of the Terms
