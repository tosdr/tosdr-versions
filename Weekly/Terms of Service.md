Terms[weeklyllc](https://weeklybudgeting.com/author/mcoviello/ "Posts by weeklyllc")2021-09-06T18:20:34-04:00

Terms and Conditions (“Terms”)
------------------------------

Last updated: October 6, 2019

Please read these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Terms and Conditions”) carefully before using the Weekly mobile application (the “Service”) operated by Weekly LLC. (“us”, “we”, or “our”).

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Weekly LLC cancels it. Your subscription is managed by iTunes. (You might know it as Apple or the App Store.) To cancel, open up your Weekly mobile app and go to Settings > Manage Subscription in iTunes. By signing up for the Services you authorize Weekly LLC to automatically charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to your credit card.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide Weekly LLC with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Weekly LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Weekly will cut off access to subscription-based features. You may be required to reconnect any previously linked bank accounts.

### Free Trial

Weekly LLC may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Weekly LLC until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, Weekly LLC reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

### Fee Changes

Weekly LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Weekly LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

### Refunds

Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.

### Accounts

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

### Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content, features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Weekly LLC and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Weekly LLC

### Links To Other Web Sites

Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Weekly LLC

Weekly LLC has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.

You further acknowledge and agree that Weekly LLC shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.

We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.

### Third Party Account Verification Provider and Financial Data

Weekly currently utilizes Plaid, a third-party technology company, to retrieve information from your linked bank accounts. Plaid offers a secure method of transmitting your banking information, and Weekly does not see or store your bank credentials.

Banking information shared with Weekly by Plaid may include ACH authentication information (account and routing numbers), transaction data, identity verification information and account balance details.

For more on how Plaid collects and manages your information, please visit [Plaid’s privacy statement](https://plaid.com/overview-privacy/).

### Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service may immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

### Transactions

If you choose to connect Weekly to your bank, debit or credit card accounts, we will download your transactions and store them in order to calculate your weekly Safe-To-Spend. We also provide you with the current balances of your bank accounts within the app. By signing up for an account, you agree to allow us to download your transactions and account information.

### Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Weeklly LLC and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password, or b) a breach of these Terms.

### Limitation Of Liability

In no event shall Weekly LLC, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

In no event will the collective liability of the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers and directors, to any party (regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort or otherwise) exceed the amount you have paid to the company for the applicable content, product, or service in the last twelve month out of which liability rose.

### Disclaimer

Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.

Weekly LLC its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements or e) the data or recommendations provided by the Service will be entirely accurate.

### Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of North Carolina, USA without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

### Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
