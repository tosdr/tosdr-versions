### Mediavine Programmatic Advertising (Ver 1.1)

The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.

First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, “Tags”) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser’s cache. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at [All About Cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.

    Hello addictivetips.com,
    
    My name is Vanessa Seward, I’m an outreach manager at Strictly Digital. I’m passionate about exploring and writing about innovation, technology including VPN, Streaming, and Netflix marketing trends. I also manage my personal blog where I actively share my thoughts on Streaming, Security and trending technologies.
    
    The reason I’m reaching out is to ask if you are accepting the sponsored post. I understand the need for unique and well-researched content, and I am also very passionate about any topic or subject that I write about. Is it still room for me to write some actionable and useful content on your blog???
    
    In particular, we’re interested in site owners who can provide the content written by their staff, with a do-follow backlink.
    
    Awaiting your positive reply,
    
    Best regards,
    
    Vanessa E. Seward,  
    Outreach manager  
    Strictly Digital
