When you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, you will be required to provide your e-mail address and to confirm your subscription by clicking a web link in your subscription confirmation e-mail.

When you place an order online with us, you may be redirected to an SSL-secured website operated by our trusted billing merchant (Avangate or Digital River) and there you will be required to provide personal information (including your credit card details) to our billing merchant. Information you provide to our billing merchant will be processed in accordance with its privacy policy (available at the bottom of billing pages) and you are therefore advised to review such policy prior to purchase.

* **To comply with legal requirements, cooperate with law enforcement, prevent crime, and protect legal rights or Blumentals Software, you and others.** To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable law, we may disclose the personal information we collect without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); (c) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible crime; (d) to enforce a contract; to protect and defend the rights or property of Blumentals Software, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients and partners and agents, other users or the public in general; or (e) act in situations involving potential threats to the personal safety of any person.
