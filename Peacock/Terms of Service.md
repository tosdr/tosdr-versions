**Peacock Terms of Use**
========================

.  
_**Updated November 8, 2023**_

_Welcome to Peacock! Here, you'll find answers to your burning legal questions about our service. We know you can't wait to get started, so without further ado, take it away, legal peacocks!_

The “**Peacock Service**” means the personalized streaming service provided to you by Peacock TV LLC and its affiliated companies (including successors and assigns, “**Peacock**,” “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”), including (i) all Peacock websites, applications, software, user interfaces, features, functionalities, recommendations and reviews, and (ii) all material, including images, videos, text, and audio associated with our service (“**Content**”).  
These Terms of Service set out the agreement between you and Peacock regarding how you can use the Peacock Service and what responsibilities you and Peacock have to each other. These Terms of Service contain important information regarding your legal rights.

**BY USING THE PEACOCK SERVICE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND AND ABIDE BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND OUR** [**PRIVACY POLICY,**](https://nbcuniversal.com/privacy) which describes our privacy practices in detail and is incorporated herein by reference. Please read them carefully.

**1\. General**  
.  
1.1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service. You may access the Peacock Service in accordance with the Terms of Service. You represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service in connection with your access to and/or use of the Peacock Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not access or use the Peacock Service. By using the Peacock Service, you will be deemed to have agreed to these Terms of Service.

1.2. Eligibility. The Peacock Service is for users who are 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States (including its territories and possessions). You may not access or use the Peacock Service if you are outside of the United States (including its territories and possessions) or are barred from receiving the Peacock Service under these Terms of Service or applicable law. By accessing or using the Peacock Service, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo (e.g., Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea or Syria), and (ii) your access to and use of the Peacock Service will comply with the [United States export control and economic sanctions requirements](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/exporter-portal).  
In addition to those we offer, parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or ﬁltering services) are commercially available, which may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information regarding providers of such protections is available at the Electronic Frontier Foundation website, [http://www.eff.org](http://www.eff.org./).

1.3. Supplemental Terms. Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to your use of certain aspects or features of the Peacock Service (“**Supplemental Terms**”), which we will provide to you or post on the Peacock Service. For clarity, the [Help Center](https://www.peacocktv.com/help) is deemed a set of Supplemental Terms. Any Supplemental Terms are in addition to and deemed part of these Terms of Service, and to the extent there is a conﬂict between the Supplemental Terms and these Terms of Service, the Supplemental Terms will prevail with respect to such conﬂict (except that these Terms of Service will control in the event of a conflict with the Help Center). If you do not agree to the applicable Supplemental Terms, you may not use the features of the Peacock Service to which they apply.

1.4. Modifications. **YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PEACOCK SERVICE IS GOVERNED BY THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS OF SERVICE**. We may modify these Terms of Service, and such changes will be effective (i) for existing users, thirty (30) days following either notiﬁcation to you or our posting of the changes on [Peacock’s website](https://www.peacocktv.com/terms), or (ii) for new users who register for the Peacock Service during such 30-day period, at the time of registration. Your continued access or use of the Peacock Service after we post changes to these Terms of Service will be deemed acceptance of these Terms of Service as modiﬁed. We encourage you to check [Peacock’s website](https://www.peacocktv.com/terms) regularly for any such changes. Customer service representatives are not authorized to modify these Terms of Service or any Supplemental Terms, either verbally or in writing, and any such modifications will have no effect.

1.5. Account Registration. You may be asked to provide registration information in order to access the Peacock Service. You are responsible for providing correct, current, and complete information and maintaining the accuracy of such information. You agree that we may take steps to verify the information you provide. The Peacock Service and any usernames and/or passwords you use to access the Peacock Service (“**Passwords**”) are for personal use only. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Passwords and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Passwords and/or other security breaches related to your Peacock Service account. You may terminate your account for any reason or no reason, and we may suspend or terminate your account for any or no reason, including a violation of these Terms of Service.

**2\. Subscriptions**  
.  
2.1. Subscriptions and Fees. The Peacock Service requires you to sign up for a subscription and pay a subscription fee (plus applicable taxes and fees), although we may in our sole discretion provide limited access to the Peacock Service or some of its Content free of charge. The Peacock Service may include multiple plans, and these plans may have different rules, which we will provide to you at sign-up. Unless otherwise stated on your sign-up page and subject to applicable law, if you sign up for a subscription, you agree that your subscription may be automatically renewed for subsequent subscription periods of equal length (for example, monthly or annually) and at the then-current subscription fee (plus applicable taxes and fees) for such subscription. You acknowledge that (i) billing for a particular plan may not occur on the same date of each month (for example, if you sign up for a monthly subscription on July 31st, you will be billed on or around August 31st, September 30th, etc.), and (ii) billing for plan upgrades or other add-ons may not occur on the same date as billing for your underlying subscription.

Subscription purchases have no monetary value (for example, they are not a cash account or equivalent) and are purchases of only a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, and non-transferable right to access and use the Peacock Service in accordance with these Terms of Service. You may not transfer, sell, purchase, barter, or trade your subscription or attempt or offer to do so. Any attempted transfer will be null and void.  
The Peacock Service and any Content accessible through it are for your personal, non-commercial use only and may not be shared beyond your household unless otherwise permitted by your subscription plan. You are solely responsible for all use of your account, including the use of your account by other members of your household. You agree not to use the Peacock Service for public or commercial performances of any kind.  
We reserve the right to change the terms of your subscription, including its price, from time to time. We will give you advance notice of any price change prior to the next billing cycle, but we will not be able to notify you of any changes in applicable taxes or fees. If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with these Terms of Service.

2.2. Payment Method. To use the Peacock Service, you must provide us with one or more payment methods. If you signed up for the Peacock Service through a third party as the biller, then your billing information must be managed through your account with the applicable third party. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method provided (including any updates to that payment method), and you authorize us to charge the applicable subscription fee (plus applicable taxes and fees) to that payment method. You acknowledge that we may process an authorization hold using your payment information in order to verify the information provided. If your payment method details change or are due to expire, then you agree that we may obtain or receive from your payment provider updated payment details including your card number, expiration date, and CVV (or equivalent).

If you do not pay any fees when due (for example, due to credit card expiration or insufficient funds), we may suspend or terminate your access to the Peacock Service. We also reserve the right to pursue any amounts you fail to pay or that arise in connection with our collection efforts, including bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and court costs.

2.3. Trial Periods. From time to time, Peacock may offer subscriptions to the Peacock Service on a limited, free-trial basis for a specified period (the “**Trial Period**”). Trial Periods may be subject to Supplemental Terms, and we have sole discretion to determine your eligibility for Trial Periods. If you are required to provide a payment method in connection with your Trial Period, your payment method will be charged the then-current subscription fee (plus applicable taxes and fees) for the Peacock Service following the expiration of the Trial Period, unless earlier terminated in accordance with these Terms of Service. You may not receive a separate notice that your Trial Period is about to end or has ended or that your paid subscription has begun.

2.4. Promotions. The Peacock Service (or certain Content available on the Peacock Service) may be offered as part of a promotion, including discounted offerings or as part of a bundle with other products or services offered by us or third parties (“**Promotions**”), and the availability of any such Promotion may be limited in duration (the “**Promotional Period**”). We are not responsible for the products and services provided by third parties.

You may redeem a particular Promotion according to the rules for that Promotion (and such rules are deemed Supplemental Terms). If you received a Promotion through a third party, additional terms and conditions may apply; please contact the applicable third party for those terms and conditions. We or the applicable third party have sole discretion to determine your eligibility for a particular Promotion and may limit your opportunity to participate. Unless we expressly state otherwise in the applicable rules, a particular Promotion can only be redeemed once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may not be combined with other offers. Your payment method will be charged the then-current subscription fee (plus applicable taxes and fees) for the Peacock Service following the expiration of the Promotional Period, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the applicable terms. You may not receive a separate notice that your Promotional Period is about to end or has ended or that your modified subscription to the Peacock Service has begun.

2.5. Cancellations, Terminations and Refunds. You may cancel your subscription to the Peacock Service at any time before the end of the then-current billing period, Trial Period, or Promotional Period (as applicable) by logging in to your account and following the cancellation instructions, which may include visiting third-party account pages if you are billed by a third party. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, and except as may be set forth in Supplemental Terms or the terms and conditions of any third-party biller, (i) a cancellation means that your subscription will not renew (that is, you will continue to have access to the Peacock Service until the end of your then-current billing period (which may be monthly or annual), Trial Period or Promotional Period (as applicable)), and (ii) you are not entitled to any refunds or credits in connection with any downgrades, suspensions, cancellations, or terminations of the Peacock Service. You acknowledge that if you signed up for plan upgrades or other add-ons that have a different billing period than the billing period of the underlying plan you cancelled, you may continue to be billed for the plan upgrade or add-on until the end of its separate billing period.

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, you will continue to own all rights in and to your User-Generated Content, except to the extent your User-Generated Content contains or is otherwise derived from materials, content, or elements owned by Peacock or any of our afﬁliated companies or partners (for example, characters or other elements created or owned by us). To the extent we authorize you to create, Upload, publicly display, or publicly perform User-Generated Content that is derived from our Content, we grant you a non-exclusive license to create a derivative work using the speciﬁcally referenced Content, and you assign to us of all rights worldwide in the work you create for the duration of copyright in the User-Generated Content in any manner and any media now known or hereafter developed, including for use on third-party sites and platforms.

Third-Party Services are provided solely as a convenience to you, and we are not responsible for Third-Party Services. Our inclusion of a link to or other integration with a Third-Party Service does not imply an endorsement by or afﬁliation with us.

(“**Apple**”), Amazon.com, Inc., Google, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronics America, Inc. or any other third-party app store or platform (each, a “**Third-Party Platform Provider**”), such Third- Party Platform Providers will be third-party beneﬁciaries to these Terms of Service. However, these Third-Party Platform Providers are not party to these Terms of Service and have no obligation to provide maintenance and/or support of the Peacock Service. Your access to the Peacock Service through the Third-Party Platform Provider’s app stores or platforms is subject to such Third-Party Platform Provider’s then-applicable Terms of Service.
