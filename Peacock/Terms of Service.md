1.3. Supplemental Terms. Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to your use of certain aspects or features of the Peacock Service (“**Supplemental Terms**”), which we will provide to you or post on the Peacock Service. For example, any Free Trials or Promotions (defined in Section 2.4 below), games, contests or sweepstakes offered in connection with the Peacock Service may be subject to Supplemental Terms. For clarity, the [Help Center](https://www.peacocktv.com/help) is deemed a set of Supplemental Terms. Any Supplemental Terms are in addition to and deemed part of these Terms of Service, and to the extent there is a conflict between the Supplemental Terms and these Terms of Service, the Supplemental Terms will prevail with respect to such conflict (except that these Terms of Service will control in the event of a conflict with the [Help Center](https://www.peacocktv.com/help)). If you do not agree to the applicable Supplemental Terms, you may not use the features of the Peacock Service to which they apply.

1.4. Modifications to the Terms of Service. **YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PEACOCK SERVICE IS GOVERNED BY THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS OF SERVICE**. We may modify these Terms of Service, and such changes will be effective (i) for existing users, thirty (30) days following either notification to you or our posting of the changes on Peacock’s website, or (ii) for new users who register for the Peacock Service during such 30-day period, at the time of registration. Your continued access or use of the Peacock Service after we post changes to these Terms of Service will be deemed acceptance of these Terms of Service as modified. We encourage you to check Peacock’s website regularly for any such  
changes. Customer service representatives are not authorized to modify these Terms of Service or any Supplemental Terms, either verbally or in writing, and any such modifications will have no effect. For clarity, Supplemental Terms associated with new Service Tiers (defined in Section 2.1 below), Free Trials or Promotions or other features will be effective upon launch of such feature.

1.5. Account Registration. You may be asked to provide registration information in order to access the Peacock Service. You are responsible for providing correct, current, and complete information and maintaining the accuracy of such information. You agree that we may take steps to verify the information you provide. The Peacock Service and any usernames and/or passwords you use to access the Peacock Service (“**Passwords**”) are for personal use only. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Passwords and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Passwords and/or other security breaches related to your Peacock Service account.

1.6. Account Sharing. The Peacock Service and any Content accessible through it are for your personal, non-commercial use only. You agree not to use the Peacock Service for public or commercial performances of any kind. Unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier, you may not share your subscription outside of your household. “**Household**” means the collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence. Additional usage rules may apply for certain Service Tiers. For more details on our account sharing policy, please visit our [Help Center](https://www.peacocktv.com/help). We may, in our sole discretion, analyze the use of your account todetermine compliance with these provisions.

You are solely responsible for all use of your account, including the use of your account by other members of your household.

1.7. Personalization and Advertising Features. The personalized recommendations offered as part of the Peacock Service and targeted advertising included in certain Service Tiers enable us to provide you with Content (including recommending relevant Content) and features that may otherwise be unavailable to you or difficult to find and are integral to the Peacock Service and these Terms of Service. The Peacock Service also analyzes your data to improve the services offered, and such continuous improvement is an integral part of the Peacock Service. By using the Peacock Service, you are requesting and directing us to provide you with a personalized (and, if applicable, ad-supported) Peacock Service that processes data as described in our Privacy Policy, subject to any choices and rights described therein.

**2\. Subscription Terms**

2.1. Service Tiers and Add-Ons. When purchasing your subscription to the Peacock Service, you may be presented with different plans or add-on options (each a “**Service Tier**”), and these Service Tiers may be subject to differences in pricing, usage rules, eligibility, restrictions, features, and device availability. We reserve the right to change the terms of your subscription, including the price, from time to time.

Some of our Service Tiers contain advertisements while others do not. Service Tiers that have “no ads” are generally free of commercial interruptions. However, due to streaming rights, such Service Tiers may still contain limited advertisements, promotional messaging and sponsorships. In addition, Service Tiers with “no ads” may offer live Content, such as special events or access to your local NBC station, which contain traditional commercial breaks. Furthermore, if you subscribe to certain Service Tiers, such as a regional sports network, in combination with a Service Tier with “no ads,” you will still see advertisements while streaming Content from the regional sports network. For more details on advertising within various Service Tiers of the Peacock Service, please visit our [Help Center](https://www.peacocktv.com/help).

2.2. Subscription Fees and Auto-Renewal. ACCESS TO THE PEACOCK SERVICE REQUIRES YOU TO SIGN UP FOR A SUBSCRIPTION, WHICH INVOLVES AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT INTO A RECURRING PAYMENT PLAN. IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE PEACOCK SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED FOR SUBSEQUENT BILLING PERIODS OF EQUAL LENGTH TO YOUR CURRENT BILLING PERIOD (FOR EXAMPLE, MONTHLY OR ANNUALLY) AT THE ENDOF THE BILLING PERIOD AT THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION FEE (PLUS APPLICABLE TAXES AND FEES) UNLESS YOU CANCEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. PAYMENT WILL BE CHARGED TO YOUR CHOSEN PAYMENT METHOD UPON PURCHASE CONFIRMATION AND AT THE START OF EVERY NEW BILLING PERIOD UNLESS YOU CANCEL.

Your billing period is the interval between each recurring billing date and corresponds to the term of your subscription. To see your next recurring billing date, log in to your account and navigate to the account details page. You acknowledge that (i) billing for a particular Service Tier may not occur on the same date of each month if your subscription began on a date not contained in a given month (for example, if you sign up for a monthly subscription on August 31st, you will be billed next on September 30th, etc.) or due to Free Trials, Promotions, gift card redemptions, or changes to your payment method, and (ii) billing for additional Service Tiers may not occur on the same date as billing for your underlying Service Tier subscription.

We will give you advance notice of any price change prior to the next billing date, but we will not be able to notify you of any changes in applicable taxes or fees. If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with the instructions below. If you do not timely cancel your subscription, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the new price in effect at the time of the renewal, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment method for these amounts.

Subscription purchases have no monetary value (for example, they are not a cash account or equivalent) and are purchases of only a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, and non-transferable right to access and use the Peacock Service in accordance with these Terms of Service. You may not transfer, sell, purchase, barter, or trade your subscription or attempt or offer to do so. Any attempted transfer will be null and void.

2.3. Payment Method. To use the Peacock Service, you must provide us with one or more payment methods. Our payment processors will keep your detailed payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date, on file. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method provided (including any updates to that payment method), and you authorize us to charge the applicable subscription fee (plus applicable taxes and fees) to that payment method. You acknowledge that we may process an authorization hold using your payment information in order to verify the information provided and that we may retry your payment method following a failed charge attempt. You are responsible for keeping your payment details up-to-date in your account settings. If your payment method details change or are due to expire, then you agree that we may obtain or receive from your payment provider updated payment details including your card number, expiration date, and CVV (or equivalent), and you authorize us to charge your payment method using the updated information.If you do not pay any fees when due (for example, due to credit card expiration or insufficient funds), we may suspend or terminate your access to the Peacock Service.

2.4. Free Trials and Promotions. From time to time, Peacock may offer subscriptions to the Peacock Service on a limited, free-trial basis (“**Free Trials**”), and the availability and length of any such Free Trial may be limited in duration (the “**Trial Period**”). The Peacock Service (or certain Content available on the Peacock Service) may also be offered as part of a promotion, including discounted offerings, third party incentives or as part of a bundle with other products or services offered by us or others (“**Promotions**”), and the availability and length of any such Promotion may be limited in duration (the “**Promotional Period**”). You may redeem a particular Promotion according to the rules for that Promotion (and such rules are deemed Supplemental Terms). If you received a Promotion through a third party, additional terms and conditions may apply; please contact the applicable third party for those terms and conditions. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by third parties. Unless we expressly state otherwise in the applicable rules, a particular Promotion can only be redeemed once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may not be combined with other offers.

Free Trials and Promotions may be subject to Supplemental Terms. We have sole discretion to determine your eligibility for a Free Trial or a particular Promotion and may limit your opportunity to participate, and we may use information such as device ID, method of payment, or an account email address to determine your eligibility. If you are required to provide a payment method in connection with a Free Trial or Promotion, your payment method will be charged the then-current subscription fee (plus applicable taxes and fees) for the Peacock Service following the expiration of the Trial Period or Promotional Period unless earlier terminated in accordance with these Terms of Service. You may not receive a separate notice that your Trial Period or Promotional Period is about to end or has ended or that your paid or full price subscription to the Peacock Service has begun unless such notice is required by applicable law.

2.5. Gift Cards. We may offer gift cards (in digital or physical form) redeemable for access to the Peacock Service. You will not be refunded redeemed gift card credits applied to an active subscription. The purchase and redemption of gift cards are subject to [Supplemental Terms](https://www.peacocktv.com/gift-cards/terms).

The availability of Content on the Peacock Service may be limited by law or by the rights that certain of our content providers grant to us and therefore may change from time to time and from place to place and may vary based on Supplemental Terms applicable to your Service Tier. For example, certain sporting events on a regional sports network and Content on your local NBC station may be unavailable due to your location, blackouts, or other restrictions set by sports leagues and other parties that control Content rights, and we may use different technologies and methods to verify your location at the time you attempt to access Content.

Any Feedback will be deemed User-Generated Content and subject to the grants by you applicable to User-Generated Content in these Terms of Service.
