uBlock Origin (uBO) does not collect any data of any kind.

* uBO has no home server.
* uBO doesn't embed any analytic or telemetry hooks in its code.
* uBO doesn't accept donations or any other form of financing.

The only time uBO connects to a remote server is to update the filter lists and other related assets. If you disable auto-update in the _"Filter lists"_ pane in the dashboard, uBO will not connect to any remote server unless you click _"Update now"_ and only if there are assets deemed "out of date."

**GitHub** is used to host the uBO project. **GitHub, Inc.** (a subsidiary of **Microsoft Corporation**) owns **GitHub** and is unrelated to uBO.

uBlock Origin - An efficient blocker for Chromium and Firefox. Fast and lean.
