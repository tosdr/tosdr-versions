The tax director is also responsible for ensuring thatpolicies and procedures that support the approach are in place, maintained and used consistently around theworld, and that the tax team has the skills and experience to implement the approach appropriately.

We establish entities in jurisdictions suitable for our business.

Pandora does not enter into artificial or abusive arrangements in order to reduce ourliability to UK taxes.
