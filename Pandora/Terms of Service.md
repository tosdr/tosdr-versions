=====================

Last updated as of April 16, 2024

Thank you for your interest in and use of our products, services, software, sites, and the content contained or accessible therein (the "Services").

This Agreement is a binding legal agreement between you and Pandora. Please read the terms and conditions of this Agreement carefully before using the Services. The Services and all data, design, text, images, graphics, including all arrangements thereof, contained therein are proprietary, confidential, and are licensed to you under this Agreement, not sold to you. By accessing or otherwise using any portion of the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are not willing to be bound by this Agreement, you may not access or otherwise use any portion of the Services.

ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US, UNLESS PROVIDED OTHERWISE HEREIN, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS OUTLINED IN SECTION 25 BELOW. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY.

AI Matters. You may not use services or technologies that are labeled or described as including, using, powered by, or being a machine learning or Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) system to discover any underlying components of the Services or our models, algorithms, metadata and systems. You may not use web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction methods to extract data from the Services. You may not use the Services, or data from the Services, to create, train, or improve (directly or indirectly) any AI service. The Service contains copyrighted material, including material we have created and materials we have licensed from third parties. Any use of copyrighted material, including use in connection with artificial intelligence or machine intelligence technologies or services or the creation of AI-trained content, is prohibited without a license from the applicable rightsholders. As part of providing the Service, we may process and store inputs to the Service as well as output from the Service, for several purposes, including improving our Services, providing and assisting in providing customer service, and monitoring for and preventing abusive or harmful uses or outputs of the Service. You are solely responsible for responding to any third-party claims regarding your use of the Services in compliance with applicable laws (including, but not limited to, copyright infringement or other claims relating to content output associated with your use of the Services).

ANY USE OF THE SERVICES NOT SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

7\. Authorized Jurisdictions.
-----------------------------

The Services are available only in the United States of America and its territories (each, an "Authorized Jurisdiction", and collectively, the "Authorized Jurisdictions"). We may add or remove countries and/or territories from the list of Authorized Jurisdictions at any time and without any notice, liability, or obligation to you with respect to each such territory. Use of the Services outside of the Authorized Jurisdictions is strictly prohibited, outside the scope of the license granted herein, and may subject your account to termination and other legal action.

8\. Communication Preferences and Consent.
------------------------------------------

From time to time we may send you communications to the email address associated with your account. These communications may include, but are not limited to, tips and station recommendations, special offers, and other account-related or transactional messages. Also, when you create a station, you may receive communications from or related to artist(s) associated with that station by or on behalf of Pandora.

Additionally, our mobile and tablet applications may, in some circumstances, offer the ability for you to receive push notifications in connection with those applications. If you would like to modify your ability to receive push notifications from our applications, you can control those settings within the settings or preferences apps of each respective device. By accepting this Agreement and using the Services, you expressly consent to the receipt of all such communications from or on behalf of Pandora. You may modify your communication preferences at any time within the Settings section of our website or applications. You may not opt-out of receiving account-related or transactional communications.

If you elected to have an advertiser contact you through third party ads displayed on the Services, your Pandora communication preferences will not affect your receipt of those advertiser-provided communications.

9\. Pandora for Business.
-------------------------

Use of the Services in a business establishment requires a special license to a separate service that is provided by Mood Media, a third party we have engaged ("Pandora for Business"). Pandora for Business is a paid service. You may only use the Services in an Authorized Jurisdiction for business use if you have met all of the following conditions:

(a) You register for a Pandora for Business account with Mood Media ("Mood Media") at [pandora.moodmedia.com](https://pandora.moodmedia.com/) or such other URL as may be provided from time to time, and agree to all applicable Mood Media terms and conditions, including without limitation, Mood Media's applicable privacy policy and terms of use (the "Mood Media Terms");

(b) You maintain an active account with both Pandora and Mood Media; and

(c) You are current on all required payments.

Your right to use the Pandora for Business service may be terminated by either Mood Media or Pandora if you fail to comply with any applicable Mood Media Terms or this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Mood Media Terms, the Mood Media Terms will control solely with respect to the use of Pandora for Business or the Services in a business environment.

ANY BUSINESS USE OF THE SERVICES NOT SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED IN THIS SECTION IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND MAY RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF YOUR RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICES.

10\. Explicit Content.
----------------------

The Services provide many forms of entertainment content, some of which you may consider inappropriate, including for persons under the age of 18. This entertainment content may contain lyrics, speech, visual images, or other media that includes strong language, or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse ("Explicit Content"). Parental discretion is advised for all users of the services under the age of 18.

Pandora provides an Explicit Content feature that, when enabled, will filter Explicit Content on the Services. You can enable this feature in the Account Settings section of the Services. You can also find out more about this explicit content feature by visiting [help.pandora.com](https://help.pandora.com/s/article/Explicit-Content-1519949297409).

11\. Content Selection and Functionality of the Service.
--------------------------------------------------------

There are many factors that influence our ability to provide certain content and services, such as licensing restrictions and content costs. Pandora reserves the right in its discretion to select, display, and perform content based on a number of different factors, including but not limited to licensing and contract restrictions and requirements, territorial limitations, industry trends, and content cost and availability. Pandora reserves the right to alter, change, modify, or terminate any services, content or application functionality at any time, with or without notice to you.

12\. Listening Activity & Behavior.
-----------------------------------

When you use the Services, we keep track of your listening activity, including the number and titles of songs to which you have listened, the songs, albums, or artists that you like (thumb up) or dislike (thumb down), the stations you create or listen to, the songs you skip, and how frequently and for how long you listen to the stations in your station list. We may also keep track of your interactions with the Services, which may include the features you use, the advertising in which you see or show interest, and the content you view. We do this for a variety of reasons, such as to gain an understanding of the types of music, content, or features you and/or other similar listeners tend to like or dislike, for compensating artists and other rightsholders for use of their content, for advertising purposes, and to improve the Services generally, which includes enhancing our music selection algorithms to make recommendations that we think you will enjoy based on your listening history. As this data is essential to the function of the Services, you may not opt out of our collection and use of such data or information. You may opt-out of the sharing of your information for third-party marketing by contacting us by e-mail at privacy@pandora.com. Please refer to our [privacy policy](https://www.pandora.com/privacy) for additional information. By accessing or otherwise using any portion of the Services, you hereby consent to the foregoing collection and use of your listening activity and behavior for the purposes set forth above and also as outlined in our [privacy policy](https://www.pandora.com/privacy).

13\. Advertising Content.
-------------------------

The Services may present advertisements for or links to third party websites, products, and/or services ("Third Party Ads"). We are not responsible for the availability of these Third Party Ads, or the images, messages, or other materials contained therein.

14\. Product Support; Feature Availability; Fraud & Abuse.
----------------------------------------------------------

Pandora is not obligated to provide technical support, and provides no assurance that any specific errors or discrepancies in the Services will be corrected.

In order to provide the best quality services to all of our users, we monitor the Services to detect and prevent fraud and abuse. We may, in our sole discretion, terminate your account and your access to the Services should we determine it is associated with fraudulent or abusive activities as it relates to the Services. Further, we reserve the right to pursue legal action in connection with fraudulent or abusive activities.

When using the Services, we may permit you to store data, preferences set by you, content or other information for your convenience, but we are under no obligation to retain any such data, preferences, content or other information that you may have stored and will not be liable for the deletion of any such information.

Unless otherwise stated, all fees and charges are due and payable in advance, are non-refundable, and are exclusive of any applicable federal, state, or local taxes. All such fees and charges (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) will be charged to the payment method you provided when you elected to access that paid component of the Services.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PANDORA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

25\. Governing Law and Disputes.
--------------------------------

PLEASE READ THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDE THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ARE HEREBY WAIVING THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR, OR A PANEL OF ARBITRATORS, INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY.

THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

(a) **Governing Law**. This Agreement, including all claims relating to or arising hereof or breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its choice-of-law principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) **Applicability of Section**. This Section 25 applies to all disputes that may arise out of, are connected with, or relate to this Agreement or the Services, subject only to the following exceptions: (1) if Pandora reasonably believes that you have in any manner acted or failed to act in any manner that may cause harm to us or any third party, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction; or (2) any dispute may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court in New York County, New York, provided that all claims by all parties in the dispute (i) fall within the jurisdiction of the small claims court, and (ii) were unsuccessfully resolved through the Informal Resolution procedure required in Section 25(c). The terms of this Section do not limit Pandora's ability to investigate complaints or reported violations of this Agreement, or to take any action we deem necessary and appropriate to mitigate actions against us, including reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties, such as music rightsholders.

(c) **Informal Resolution**. If you have any dispute with us arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement or the Services, you agree to contact us directly and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account) (a "dispute notice"); and give us sixty (60) days from the date of filing your written description with us within which to resolve the dispute to your reasonable satisfaction. Any dispute notice must include (i) the claimant's name, address, phone number, email address and, if applicable, Pandora username; (ii) description of the nature and basis of the dispute; (iii) relevant facts regarding the dispute; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel, agent or other representative) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the notice. Such informal resolution request must be made individually and must concern only the initiating party's dispute and no other person's dispute.

If Pandora does not resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations under this informal process, you may pursue the dispute in accordance with the arbitration agreement below. Any demand for arbitration under this Agreement shall be made before the applicable statute of limitations has run. Compliance with this Informal Resolution section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Resolution procedures set forth in this Section. These Informal Resolution procedures are essential so that you and we have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally.

(d) **Class Action Waiver**. You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any dispute submitted to arbitration or litigation. There shall be no right or authority for any disputes to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, as a private attorney general, or other subscribers or listeners, or other persons similarly situated. The parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated. This paragraph shall be known as the "Class Action Waiver."

The Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the resolution of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from the agreement to arbitrate disputes. The parties agree any challenge to the validity or effect of this Class Action Waiver must be decided by a court. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void, subject to the right to appeal any limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. If this entire agreement to arbitrate is determined to be null and void, then the parties agree that any actions shall be brought in the State or Federal courts of New York, New York.

(e) **Arbitration Agreement**. Any claims by Pandora, or claims by you that are not resolved by the Informal Resolution procedure described in Section 25(c), arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including utilizing desk, phone, or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel) in effect at the time the claim is filed.

The party initiating arbitration must follow the rules and procedures of AAA in effect at the time the claim is filed, and the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by AAA. You may obtain copies of the current rules, forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by contacting:

American Arbitration Association  
1633 Broadway, 10th Floor  
New York, NY 10019  
Web site: www.adr.org // call: 1-800-778-7879

You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they (i) have complied with and completed the Informal Resolution procedure requirements contained in Section 25(c); and (ii) are a party to this agreement to arbitrate enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).

This Agreement and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) will apply in all cases and govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition to and notwithstanding the terms stated above, the following will apply to your disputes: (1) the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, except the Class Action Waiver; (2) the arbitrator will not have the power to conduct any form of class or collective arbitration, nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals; and (3) you hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to a court trial (other than small claims court as provided above) or to serve as a representative, as a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit, arbitration, or other proceeding against us or related third parties arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, including a claim for public injunctive relief brought in an individual capacity, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.

The arbitration proceeding and the results thereof will be kept confidential by each party and not used for any purpose other than a party exercising its rights and fulfilling its obligations with respect to the other party; provided, however that either party may disclose the existence and results of the proceeding: (1) as required by law, rule, or regulation; (2) to its accountants, attorneys, and other fiduciaries; and (3) to an arbitrator or third party who has exercised its rights under this Section 25 for use as persuasive authority in other proceedings brought pursuant to this Section 25.

You agree that any arbitrations between you and Pandora will be subject to the provisions in this Section 25 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Pandora.

(f) **Arbitration Costs**. Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee. All other fees will be allocated as provided by the AAA rules and applicable law. Each party will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails. If the arbitrator finds that either party's claim or the relief sought in the demand for arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the other party will have the right to recover its attorneys' fees and expenses, including arbitration fees.

(g) **Limitation of Actions**. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, relating to, or connected with your use of the Services, must be filed within twelve (12) months of the date the facts giving rise to the action were known or should have been known by you, or forever be barred.

In the event any provisions of this Agreement are found to be contrary to any law or regulation of an administrative or governmental agency or body, such provision will be modified and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. In the event such a provision cannot be modified and becomes invalidated or unenforceable, its invalidation or unenforceability will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.
