Intellectual Property Policy
============================

Pandora Media, LLC (**"Pandora", "we," "us," "our"**) respects the intellectual property rights of others, and desires to provide a platform with content that does not violate those rights. We also expect, as stated in our [Terms of Use](https://www.pandora.com/legal/), that users of our platform also respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you are the holder of a copyright and believe in good faith that your work has been reproduced on our platform in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbggDbJPtqFVIIiDJnpgX7FLzWIQ91lqeBirH8JRXa434VJA/viewform) for instructions on how to notify Pandora.

Music on Pandora
----------------

Most content available on Pandora is provided and licensed to Pandora from third party content providers, but in some cases we play music under the compulsory license for sound recordings (Section 114 of the U.S. Copyright Act), in both cases in combination with blanket, direct, and/or compulsory publishing licenses. Once you have submitted a notification to Pandora regarding your dispute, we will contact the provider of the disputed content regarding your claim. We will generally ask that the provider work with you directly to resolve the issue. In the event your claim is against content that we are providing under the compulsory license for sound recordings, we will assess the validity of our applicable licenses to continue playing that song, and our policy will be to continue to play the music in our discretion so long as we hold a valid license. For all claims of infringement, we will ask that you follow the notification procedure established in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, using the link above.

Your Content on Pandora
-----------------------

If you upload or provide written, photographic, audiovisual, or other content to Pandora in connection with your use of the Services, the AMP Service, or participation in a Pandora-sponsored campaign ("Your Content"), you represent and warrant that you own all rights in Your Content and have the right to grant Pandora the licenses described in Section 17 of our [Terms of Use](https://www.pandora.com/legal/), Section 2 of the [AMP Terms of Use](https://amp.pandora.com/amp-terms), or other applicable agreement. You further represent and warrant that Your Content does not infringe the rights of any third party, including any rights of copyright, trademark, name, likeness, publicity, or other intellectual property rights. You agree to abide by the notice and takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act with respect to any claims of infringement related to Your Content. If you are found to be a repeat infringer, your account will be terminated.
