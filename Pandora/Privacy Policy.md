1\. Territorial Restrictions
----------------------------

The Services are controlled and operated from the United States. Sirius XM audio services under this Policy are provided by subscription and intended for use only by residents of the United States. If you are a resident of Canada, your service is governed by your Customer with Sirius XM Canada Inc., and your use of the services offered through Sirius XM Canada is governed by the Sirius XM Canada Privacy Policy. If you are not a resident of the United States, please do not interact with the Services or otherwise provide us with your personal data. To enforce our territorial limits, we may collect data associated with a device to determine the country from which the device is accessing the Services. If we receive data from your device's location indicating that you are outside the United States, we may block your access to the Services from that particular device. If you attempt to access the Services when you are outside the United States, we will use your IP address for the legitimate interest of allowing or denying access to geo-restricted content within our Services. If you disable such geolocation on your device and we have no other method of determining your location and whether you are within our service territory, then you will not have access to the geographically restricted channels on your device regardless of your location.

NOTE: In addition to being made available through Sirius XM Services, Sirius XM Podcast Content may be distributed by other third party platforms wherever such platforms make such content available. When you access the Sirius XM Podcast Content content through any such platform, that distribution platform's privacy policy applies including with regard to any transfer and processing of any personal data.  If you provide any personal data directly to us through the Team Coco or 99%Invisible website or any interaction with Team Coco or 99% Invisible directly, you understand that your data will be transferred to and processed in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. By using either or these websites, or otherwise providing us with your personal data, you thereby consent to the transfer and processing of personal data in the United States.

2\. Personal Data We Collect
----------------------------

We collect data that is linked to or can be linked to a specific individual for the purposes described in this Policy. This data, called “personal data” (sometimes also referred to as “personal information”), may be provided directly by you to us, provided to us by third parties, such as automotive manufacturers or dealers, retailers, or promotional partners, or collected from you automatically through your service usage, cookies, and other technologies. We may combine personal data we collect from these sources or through our various Services. Certain data such as IP addresses and account identifiers may also be considered personal data by applicable law.

At times, we may de-identify your personal data through a variety of means, such as by blending your data with data about other individuals or otherwise removing the characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. Such de-identified data is considered non-personal to the full extent allowed by applicable law. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law such as to evaluate the sufficiency of our de-identification processes. We may use and share any non-personal data with third parties for any purpose in our discretion and as permitted by law, including for advertising, research and marketing purposes. However, if we combine non-personal data with personal data, we will treat the combined information as personal data.

3\. Summary of Sirius XM Key Personal Data Practices
----------------------------------------------------

This section and the next present a summary of our key personal data practices. For more detail, please see the [Sirius XM Data Collection and Use Table](#24) at the end of this Policy for the (1) categories of personal data we collect, (2) purposes for which we collect that information, (3) categories of third parties to whom that information may be disclosed for a business purpose and (4) categories of third parties to whom the information may be sold for monetary value or other valuable consideration or shared for cross contextual behavioral advertising/targeted advertising. We encourage you to read the Table carefully. Please also review Section 4 [“More About our Data Practices”](#5) section for certain specific types of data collection and use.

* **We collect personal data about you from you directly, automatically through your use of the Services, and from third parties**.The categories of personal data we collect include: 1. Registration Data, 2. Vehicle Data, 3. Payment Data, 4. Sensitive Personal Data, 5. Other Demographic Data, 6. Transaction Information, 7. Listening Preferences, 8. Account Information and Settings, 9. Device Data, 10. Audio and Visual Data, and 11. Geolocation Data (which may include precise geolocation with your consent).
* **We use personal data** to facilitate your access to the Services, to manage your account and subscriptions, to personalize your listening, marketing and advertising experiences, and to send you information from us or on behalf of certain third parties. We also use personal data to troubleshoot and improve the Services, to develop new products and services, and to maintain and protect our systems and your data. If you access the Services using an in-vehicle SiriusXM radio, please also review Section 8 [“Supplemental Information for Users of SiriusXM In-Vehicle Services”](#14) section for in-vehicle specific information. If you use the Pandora Services, please review Section 9 [“Supplemental Information for Users of Pandora Services”](#15).
* **We share your personal data** for business purposes with our subsidiaries, third party service providers, vendors and licensors, other Sirius XM users when you provide access to your subscription, and unaffiliated third-party business relationships for business and advertising purposes. For more details, please review Section 4 [“Disclosures to Third Parties”](#5). Please note, if you choose to participate in community forums and similar features on the Services or make requests to on-air hosts, the information you share will become public and outside the scope of this Policy.
* **Sirius XM engages third party businesses for a variety of business and commercial purposes**, including service providers of technology, customer care support, marketing, shopping and shipping (such as Shopify) and payment processing (such as but not limited to Apple, Google, and Stripe Inc.). Please note that collection and use of payment information by third party merchants and payment processors is subject to the privacy policy and terms of the respective third party. For example, Stripe Inc.'s collection and processing of payment information is governed by the Stripe Privacy Policy located at [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy).
* **Sirius XM works with advertisers, advertising agencies, and providers of ad-related services** for targeted advertising. Providers of ad-related services such as attribution, measurement, and analytics, may set and access their own tracking technologies (like cookies tags or pixels) on your device. They may use this information to serve and measure performance of ads for the Services when placed on third party publishers and channels, to serve and measure performance of third party advertisers' ads on the Services, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of ads. For more information, including your opt-out choices, please review Section 5 [“Third Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls”](#11) and the information set forth in the Table at the end of this Privacy Policy. This practice may be considered sale or regulated sharing under certain US state laws and residents of those states may have additional rights. For more information, please review Section 13 [“State Specific Rights”](#20).

4\. More About our Data Practices

Here is additional detail about some specific data practices listed in the Table in Section 14.

When you set up a profile for listening use on a Sirius XM Service, you provide us with personal data and agree that such personal data and any listening and service usage information associated to your profile may be collected and processed to support the profile features. We do not use profile personal data for advertising or share profile personal data with third parties other than service providers.

If you do not consent to such recording, use and retention, please do not use the chat assistance feature.

We collect your voice command when interacting with the Services, in order to execute the request and for analysis for product improvement. Your voice command is not used to identify you individually and is not retained in association with you or your subscription. Audio that we collect from you may be shared with a third party service provider for transcription.

**Data Collected Through Mobile and Connected Devices:**

**Software Development Kits** (“**SDKs**”). We and certain third parties with whom we have a relationship to facilitate our business and advertising purposes collect data through the use of embedded scripts and tools provided in SDKs. These SDKs are included in the app itself and may collect information when you install the mobile app or access the Services through mobile devices. Such data may include hardware model, operating system and version, device ID, mobile network information, and application usage behavior.  Some Device Data may be deemed personal data, to the extent that it remains associated with a device identifiable to you in some way. When this is the case, we treat Device Data as personal data. Device Data is used for the business and commercial purposes disclosed in this Policy, such as to deliver and personalize the Services to you, to understand service usage and improve the Services, to debug, troubleshoot, prevent fraud and other security related purposes, to identify you across devices for service and advertising purposes, and to facilitate your request to log in to the Service through a third party or social media platform, conduct a transaction through a third party or share content with a friend or other third party account. Settings specific to your mobile or connected device manufacturer may allow you to change or block the transmission of your device ID and other Device Data. Please see the privacy policy of your device manufacturer for details.

**Connected Devices.**The Services may also be accessed through third party devices such as connected set top boxes or media players, speakers or other smart devices, gaming consoles, or other similar devices.  Sirius XM does not control these devices, your underlying subscription with that device, or their collection and use of your personal data, including in relationship to targeted advertising they may deliver through a connected device. Please contact the manufacturer of the connected device or purveyor of the connected services for information on their privacy practices and policies.

**Sharing with Third Parties**

We may share personal data we have collected about you in the circumstances described below or elsewhere in the Policy.  Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party. If you decide that you do not want to receive communications from a third party, or have questions about their privacy practices, you will need to contact that third party directly.

A.   Other Sirius XM Users

Personal data on your account or subscription may be accessible to others that you allow to interact with your account/subscription. It is solely your choice whether or not you allow other individuals to have access to your account or sign-in credentials. This includes individuals whom you allow to use or access any streaming account associated with your Sirius XM subscription. Please note that if you leave your profile open on an active Sirius XM in-vehicle account, other drivers of the vehicle may be able to view certain profile information. You are responsible for managing your profile, including removing it from a vehicle. You may do so through your [Profile Management Portal](https://portal.siriusxm.com/sign-in). Visit [https://www.siriusxm.com/help/profiles-2](https://www.siriusxm.com/help/profiles-2) for more information.

B. Subsidiaries

Sirius XM may share personal data collected in conjunction with the Services with our subsidiaries for business, analytical, marketing, operational and advertising purposes and to offer, provide, and improve services and products offered both individually and jointly.  

C. Unaffiliated Third-Party Business Relationships

We may share your personal data with unaffiliated third parties with whom we have a business relationship for ours or for their own business and advertising purposes. These third parties may include companies with whom we have marketing, licensing, sponsorship, product or service distribution or similar agreements. Such third party's use of the personal data is subject to their privacy policy and data practices. You may opt-out of our sharing of your information for third-party marketing through your Sirius XM Online Account Center (for former or current SiriusXM subscribers) or by sending an email request to opt-out of sharing for third-party marketing to [privacy @siriusxm.com](mailto:privacy%20@siriusxm.com) or [privacy@pandora.com](mailto:privacy@pandora.com), depending upon your subscription service. Opt-out requests received via these channels may take up to 15 business days to process. California residents, please see Section 13 “State-Specific Rights” for additional information.

Note that when you elect to accept a promotional offer for a service offered by a third party as part of a SiriusXM premium or other subscription service, we will only share information with that third party in order to confirm your eligibility for the associated service or as needed to maintain your access to the promotion, unless you consent to additional sharing or uses by the third party.

D. Third Parties to Whom you Agree or Direct Us to Share Your Personal Data 

We may share your personal data when you expressly consent or otherwise direct us to do so. For example, you may agree to share your information with a third-party content provider in order to have access to that content.

E. Social Media and Other Third Party Platforms

We may facilitate interactions with social media or other third party platforms which may include the ability to “like” or “share” content. You may also have the opportunity to log in through or otherwise connect your third party platform account to your subscription Service. When you interact with these third party platforms through the Services, we will receive your personal data from the third party platform service and you agree to share data, which may be personal, about your interactions with the Service with that social media service. We may also receive personal data identifying you if other users of social media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their connections or “friends.”

Personal data collected and stored by the third party is subject to that third party's privacy practices, including, without limitation, whether the third party continues to share data with us, the types of data shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature; however we may retain data previously collected.

A third party platform or service, such as Facebook/Meta or TikTok, may place cookies on your device or and/or on the Services that collect information about your use of the Services, including your IP address or other device identifiers, and which pages you visit on the Services. The third party platform may be able to collect personal data about you on your visits to the Services regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the third party platform. If you are logged out or do not have an account and visit a page with a social plug-in, your browser sends a more limited set of data, such as the webpage you are visiting, the date and time of your visit, and other browser-related information. Please see [Section 5](#9) about how to manage cookies and tags online.

 F. Information You Disclose Publicly. Services may offer message boards, chats, forums, and other public areas (“**Community Forums**”) where you can choose to interact with others and/or to post or submit comments, images, and content. Note that anything you choose to disclose in such a Community Forum is public.  Similarly, any information you choose to post to a social media or third-party platform will be publicly available. This Policy does not apply to collection and use of such public information. Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any personal data. 

G. Public Broadcasting/On Air. If you provide us with personal data when making a request such as a birthday announcement, comments or suggestions, or content requests, we may use the personal data you provide in accordance with this Policy, including to announce your name and request on the air where relevant.

H. Sweepstakes, Promotions, and Surveys.<

We may offer sweepstakes, contests, in-studio events, giveaways, research surveys and other promotions (any of which, a “Promotion”) that require registration or request additional information. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that govern the Promotion, which may contain specific requirements (including, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness, or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials where allowed by law). If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal data may be disclosed to third parties, to vendors facilitating the implementation of the Promotion, or to the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, as required by law, or as permitted by the Promotion’s terms or official rules.

I. Third Parties in the Course of a Business Transition. 

In the event one or more entities of Sirius XM goes through a business transition, Sirius XM reserves the right to disclose and transfer all personal data related to the respective Services to the full extent allowed by law (including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process): (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Services; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, bankruptcy, the sale of certain of Sirius XM’s ownership interests, assets, or both, or other company change. By providing your information, you understand and agree that we may transfer such information to the acquiring entity without your further consent, except where required by law.

5\. Third Party Advertising and Analytics/Privacy Controls
----------------------------------------------------------

Sirius XM engages in third party business relationships, including with advertising companies, ad agencies, ad tech providers, measurement and attribution vendors, and analytics providers to place and display Sirius XM ads, to deliver third party ads on the Services, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and ad effectiveness. In addition, some advertisers, agencies and ad tech vendors may utilize their own tracking technologies embedded in their ads or on your device, and they may otherwise collect or have access to data about your device and other information about you, some of which may be personal data under certain state laws. Some of these parties may collect personal data over time when you visit the Services or other online websites and services. We may share data that has been aggregated, de-identified, or pseudonymized or Device Data, and general location information with advertising companies, analytics providers, and attribution and measurement vendors, including for the purpose of serving you more relevant ads on and off the Services.

There are a variety of means and tools that allow you to place some limits on the collection and use of your personal data for targeted and/or cross device behavioral advertising by third parties, or by Sirius XM on other sites and applications:

**Cookie Opt-Out Tools**.  To disable sharing through cookies set on our site by third parties for advertising and analytics purposes, please adjust your settings by clicking on either Cookie Settings or Manage Cookies from the footer of our webpages. 

**NAI/DAA Opt-Out**.  Some advertising companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The NAI provides information regarding targeted advertising, the [opt-out procedures of NAI members](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/), and a tool to opt out from participating NAI members using your hashed email address for interest-based advertising. You may also want to visit the [DAA’s website](https://optout.aboutads.info/) for  more about targeted advertising and an opt-out for DAA-participating companies.

**Mobile Device/AppChoices**.  Mobile devices contain settings that may allow you to disable tracking advertising or analytics. If you are using an iOS-based device and do not want to receive advertisements personalized to you or your individual interests, you may be able to limit these advertisements by enabling “Limit Ad Tracking” on your iOS Device following the [instructions provided by Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074). If you are using an Android-based device and do not wish to receive advertisements personalized to you, you can visit [Google’s Ads Settings page](https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous?hl=en) from a browser on your Android-based device and make your choices there. In addition, the digital advertising industry has provided the ability for mobile users to register at [AppChoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) for their intent not to receive targeted advertising.

**Google Analytics/Adobe Analytics.**  We utilize Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies, to collect and analyze information about the use of the Services and report on activities and trends. These services may also collect information about the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can [learn about Google’s practices](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), and opt out of them by downloading the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) [Learn about Adobe’s practices here.](https://www.adobe.com/privacy.html) 

Note that cookie settings and other technological controls are specific to the browser or device on which such control is implemented.  When cookies or other such tags are disabled, we are not able to recognize you when you use a different device to access the Services, and therefore cannot apply the settings from the initial device.  You will need to manage your cookies and tag settings as well as any global privacy controls individually on each device with which you access the Services.

Please note it is not possible to opt-out of all advertising on the Services. Advertising allows the Services to be delivered with limited ads at a generally lower subscription cost to you, or through the ad-supported subscription tier where available, at no additional subscription fee. Using any combination of the methods described here to opt-out of targeted advertising means only that you will not receive ads tailored to you as a unique individual. By continuing to access the Services, you understand that even in light of your cookie settings and other opt-out choices, you will continue to receive ads, which may be delivered based on non-personalized information about the context or genre of the content to which you are listening, or the general demographic or behavioral interest profile of listeners of certain content, types of music, or titles or episodes of podcasts. You may also receive ads that are delivered generally to anyone in a certain geographical region or based on aggregated or non-personal data.

6\. Your Choices and Opt Out Rights
