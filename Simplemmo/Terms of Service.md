Using SimpleMMO requires you to create an account with us (an "Account") and provide us with a username, email password, and certain other information about you.

**4\. Membership and Virtual Currency**  
SimpleMMO is free to play and we aim to keep it that way. However, certain premium features are available to purchase either through our membership subscription or in exchange for purchasing “Diamonds” for real money.  
You may purchase a membership subscription or Diamonds within SimpleMMO (both the app and desktop variants of the game) by providing your debit card, credit card, or other payment information. We use third-party payment processors (Stripe, Google Play, and Apple App Store) to process your payments and will share your payment information with them. All card details you provide are stored by our trusted third-party payment providers (Stripe, Google Play, and Apple App Store) and are not stored by us.  
  
**IMPORTANT INFORMATION, PLEASE READ.**  
Both the purchase of Diamonds and the membership are subject to a number of conditions and restrictions.  
  
Memberships are rolling monthly renewing automatically at the end of your subscription period and your chosen payment method will be automatically charged. We reserve the right to amend, modify or remove certain aspects of membership benefits (including the monthly subscription price), from time to time, in our absolute discretion. Where we do so, we will notify you of these changes in advance, usually through the release notes section within the game.  
  
You can find details on your membership, including how to cancel your membership, within the “Settings” section of SimpleMMO or via the Google Play Store subscription area depending on your method of payment.  
  
Diamonds can only be redeemed within SimpleMMO; however, Diamonds or any other virtual currency we may make available to you through SimpleMMO have no inherent or monetary value and are not your own private property, rather they constitute a measurement of the extent of your license in a Galahad Creative Ltd product.  
  
We do not provide any cash or refunds for Diamonds (except as required by law) and we may impose additional restrictions relating to the purchase and/or redemption of Diamonds. Where we do, we will notify you of these changes in advance, usually through the release notes section within the game.  
  
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, DIAMONDS OR ANY OTHER VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND/OR MICROCREDITS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU HAVE NO CASH VALUE, DO NOT ACCRUE INTEREST AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW, ARE NOT REDEEMABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR ANY SUM OF MONEY AT ANY TIME.  
  
  
**5\. Payment Information & Refunds**  
All purchases, be it for membership or for virtual currency, such as Diamonds, require you to provide a valid debit card, credit card, or other accepted payment information. We use third-party payment processors (Stripe, Google Play, and Apple App Store) to process your payments and will share your payment information with them. All card details you provide are stored by our trusted third-party payment provider Stripe (or Google Pay, if you purchase directly through your Android device) and are not stored by us. Payments may be displayed as "Galahad Creative Ltd." on your credit statement.  
If you buy any of our paid for features (“Premium Features”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to any additional terms specific to those Premium Features. Failure to pay these fees may result in the termination of your paid services.  
All subscription-based features (such as memberships) will renew automatically at the end of each subscription period, and your payment method will automatically be charged the current fee and taxes applicable to the new subscription period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date.  
You also agree that:  
• Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location and that we have absolute discretion in determining any applicable exchange or conversion rate.  
  
• The taxes payable by you in respect of the Premium Features you have purchased may be based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.  
  
• We may store (either directly or through our trusted third-party payment provider) and continue billing your payment method, to avoid interruptions in your Services and to pay for other Services you may buy.  
  
• We may change our fees or benefits associated with the Premium Features from time to time with reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the premium features.  
  
In respect of any purchased made through the SimpleMMO store, typically:  
  
\- Diamonds purchased via Google Play, Apple App Store or Stripe can be refunded if an administrator is contacted within 24 hours and no Diamonds associated with that purchase have been spent within SimpleMMO;  
\- We may refund you in respect of any in-game reward purchases you make in the form of Diamonds only, where an administrator is contacted within 48 hours of purchase.  
  
This is only applicable to the following rewards:  
\* Custom Avatar  
\* Item Rename  
\* Custom Colour on Username  
\* Custom Gradient Colour on Username.  
  
You also may change your user-submitted reward up to (2) times within 3 days of purchase. This is limited to the following rewards:  
\* Custom Avatar  
\* Item Rename  
\* Custom Colour on Username  
\* Custom Gradient Colour on Username.  
  
Outside the above policy, we are happy to review requests for refunds on a case by case basis. However, unless required by law, we will not refund any amounts paid in relation to memberships or Diamonds when:  
• You have lost your access to a Premium Feature due to being suspended or banned from SimpleMMO, where we have reason to believe you have violated these terms or the Game Rules;  
• Those purchases were as a result of your Account being compromised (unless it was as a result of our negligence);  
• You have been the victim of in-game scamming.
