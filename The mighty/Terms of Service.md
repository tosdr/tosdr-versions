13. ****International Users.  The Mighty Properties can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain. references to Services and Content that are not available in your country.  These references do not imply that The Mighty intends to announce such Services or Content in your country.  The Mighty Properties are controlled and offered by The Mighty from its facilities in the United States of America.

14. **Dispute Resolution_.__Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“_Arbitration Agreement_”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with The Mighty and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us._**
    1. **Applicability of Arbitration Agreement_._** You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, to any products sold or distributed through the Site, or to any aspect of your relationship with The Mighty, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or The Mighty may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.**IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH The Mighty, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST The Mighty ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.  INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST The Mighty IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.  IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.**
    2. **Arbitration Rules and Forum_._**  ****The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Incorporating Services, Ltd., 3500 S Dupont Highway, Dover, Delaware 19901.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.   Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/); all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/](http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/).  JAMS’s rules are also available at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, The Mighty will pay them for you.  In addition, The Mighty will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Likewise, The Mighty will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.****You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.   Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    3. **Authority of Arbitrator**.**  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and The Mighty.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.**
    4. **Waiver of Jury Trial****.**  YOU AND The Mighty HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and The Mighty are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 16 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.   However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
    5. **30-Day Right to Opt Out****.**You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address at Mighty Proud Media, Inc., 210 N Glenoaks Blvd. Suite C, Burbank, CA 91502, or email address at [community@themighty.com](mailto:community@themighty.com) within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, your The Mighty username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
    6. **Severability_._** If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
    7. **Survival of Agreement_._** This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with The Mighty.
    8. **Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if The Mighty makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice to The Mighty.
15. **General Provisions.**

    7. **Governing Law.**  THE TERMS AND ANY ACTION RELATED THERETO WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.  THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THESE TERMS.
    8. **Notice.**  Where The Mighty requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing The Mighty with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to The Mighty is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms, The Mighty’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.  You may give notice to The Mighty at the following address: 210 N Glenoaks Blvd. Suite C, Burbank, CA 91502. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by The Mighty by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.
    9. **Waiver.** Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
    10. **Severability.**  If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
