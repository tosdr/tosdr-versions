* **Data providers**, such as information services and data licensors.
* **Public sources**, such as social media platforms.
* **Research partners**, such as universities, companies and other organizations with whom we partner on research initiatives.

**Automatic data collection.**  We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your activity over time on our sites and other sites and online services, such as:

* **Device data,** such as your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.

* **General location**, such as country, state, and city, which is derived from your IP address. Your country is shown publicly on your account by default to help you connect with other members in your country (you can choose to make your location private in your account settings).

**Cookies.** Some of our automatic data collection is facilitated by cookies and similar technologies.  For more information, see our [Cookie Notice](https://themighty.com/cookie-notice/).

**Chat technologies.** We use third party services, such as those provided by [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/), that employ cookies and software code to operate chat features that you can use to communicate with us through the Service. Intercom and other third parties may access and use information about webpages visited on our website, your IP address, your general location (e.g., country, state, city), and other personal information you share through online chats for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

**How we use your personal information**
----------------------------------------

We use your personal information for the following purposes or as otherwise described at the time we collect it:

**Service delivery.**  We use your personal information to:

* provide, operate and improve the Service and our business;
* establish and maintain your user profile on the Service;
* enable security features of the Service, such as by sending you security codes via email, and remembering devices from which you have previously logged in;
* communicate with you about the Service, including by sending announcements, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
* understand your needs and interests, and personalize your experience with the Service and our communications (for example, presenting relevant articles and content based on your condition information or gender); and
* provide support for the Service, and respond to your requests, questions and feedback.

**Research and development.**  We may use your personal information to offer opportunities to participate in research surveys and other activities, conduct research and development, and develop user profiles and segmentation to provide you with personalized resources and opportunities, and to analyze and improve the Service and our business. As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified or other anonymous data from personal information we collect. We make personal information into anonymous data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Service and promote our business.

**Marketing and advertising.**  We and our third party advertising partners may collect and use your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes:

* **Direct marketing**. We may send you The Mighty-related or other direct marketing communications as permitted by law, including by email. You may opt-out of our marketing communications as described in the [Opt-out of marketing communications](#Opt-out-of-marketing-communications) section below.
* **Interest-based advertising.**  We may contract with third-party advertising partners to display ads on our Service and other online services. These partners may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about you (including the device data and online activity data described above) over time across our Service and other online services, as well as your interaction with our emails. They use that data and other information they collect to try to help advertisers reach their desired audience on the Service and/or tailor the ads you see on the Service and other online services to your interests. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising, in the [Your choices](https://themighty.com/cookie-notice/) section of the Cookie Notice.

**Compliance and protection.**  We may use your personal information to:

* comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities;
* protect our, your or others’ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims); 
* audit our internal processes for compliance with legal and contractual requirements and internal policies; 
* enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Service; and 
* prevent, identify, investigate and deter fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity, including cyberattacks and identity theft.  

**Retention.** We retain personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested; to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements; to establish or defend legal claims; or for fraud prevention). Whether the retention period is sufficient to fulfill such purposes is the primary criteria for determining the duration of the retention period. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**How we share your personal information**
------------------------------------------

We may share your personal information with the following parties and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection:  

**Affiliates.**  Our corporate parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Advertising partners.**  Third party advertising companies that collect information about your activity on the Service and other online services to help us advertise products and services.

**Professional advisors.**  Professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

**Other users and the public.** Username and some optional profile data, such as biographical details, pronouns, profile picture, and links to your social media networks, are visible to the public and other users by default. The groups you lead and content that you post on the Service, including personally identifiable or medical information, is visible to other users and to the public as well in public communities. Any information you allow to be visible to the public or other users can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads the information that you make viewable or what they may choose to do with it.

**Business partners.** We may compile and share with our research partners and other business partners information that you make publicly available on the Service (e.g., all posts in a certain time period by users posting about a particular medical condition). We may also share information you provide when you participate in our surveys or other research activities with our research partners and other business partners as described to you when we collect that information.

Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to access all features of the Service or they may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

**Third party platforms.** If you choose to connect to the Service through your social media account, you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it. If you revoke our ability to access information from a third party platform, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.

**Delete your content or close your account.** You can choose to delete certain content through your account. If you wish to request to close your account, please [contact us](#How-to-contact-us), or you can initiate account deletion on the mobile app version of the Service from the user preferences screen.

----------------------------

The Service may contain links to websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.

We do not control websites, mobile applications or online services operated by third parties, and we are not responsible for their actions.

**Security**
------------

We employ a number of technical, organizational and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

**International data transfer**
-------------------------------

We are headquartered in the United States and may use service providers that operate in other countries. Your personal information may be transferred to the United States or other locations where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your state, province, or country.

**Children**
------------

The Service is not intended for use by children under 16 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Service from a child under 16 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy** 
-----------------------------------

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service. If required by law we will also provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as via email or another manner through the Service. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting).

**State law privacy rights notice**
-----------------------------------

**Scope.**  Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to residents of states where they have privacy laws applicable to us that grant their residents the rights described below.

For purposes of this section, “personal information” has the meaning given to “personal data”, “personal information” or similar terms under the applicable privacy laws of the state in which you reside. Please note that not all rights listed below may be afforded to all users and that if you are not a resident of the relevant states, you may not be able to exercise these rights. In addition, we may not be able to process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to confirm your identity or understand and respond to it.

In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of residents of these states, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply with respect to the activities it describes instead of this section.

**Your Privacy Rights.** You have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law. 

* **Information/know.**  You can request whether we have collected your personal information, and in certain cases, information about how we use and share it. For example, if you are a California resident, you can request information for the past 12 months about:
    * the categories of personal information that we have collected; the categories of sources from which we collected personal information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing and/or selling personal information;
    * categories of any personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose. and;
    * the categories of any third parties with whom personal information was sold, shared or disclosed for a business purpose.
* **Access**.  You can request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you. 
* **Correction**.  You can request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we have collected about you. 
* **Deletion.**  You can request that we delete your personal information. Please note that once we process a deletion request, we may be unable to provide access or support to any past products or services.
* **Opt-out**.
    * **Opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes.**  You can opt-out of certain tracking activities for targeted advertising (also known as interest-based advertising) purposes. The CCPA defines this as “sharing” your personal information with the advertising partners.
    * **Opt-out of profiling and limit the use of your sensitive personal information.**  If we process your personal information for profiling purposes as defined by applicable privacy laws, you can opt-out of such processing.
* **Nondiscrimination.** You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination as prohibited by applicable privacy laws.
* **Sales.** We do not “sell” personal information as defined by applicable state privacy laws and we have not sold personal information in the preceding 12 months.

**How to Exercise Your Rights**

* **Information/know, access, correction, and deletion.** You may submit requests to exercise these rights at [https://themighty.com/privacy-request/](https://themighty.com/privacy-request/) or by mailing us at PO Box 12539, Glendale, CA 91224. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it. You can ask to appeal any denial of your request in the same manner through which you may submit a request.
* **Opt-out**
    * **Opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes.** While we do not sell personal information for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as described above. Applicable privacy laws may classify our use of some of these services as “sharing” your personal information with the advertising partners that provide the services, from which you have the right to opt-out. You can submit requests to opt-out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes here: [Your Privacy Choices](https://themighty.com/your-privacy-choices/). Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request. You can also broadcast the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt-out for each participating browser system that you use. Learn more at the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) website
    * **Opt-out of profiling and limit the use of your sensitive personal information.** You may receive marketing-related emails based on the topics that you choose to follow. You may follow a topic by clicking “follow” on the topic page, or we may enroll you into following topics that match your interests or profile data that you have chosen to share, such as your or others’ medical condition. Applicable privacy laws may classify sending such marketing emails based on your interests, profile data and the topics that you follow as “profiling”. You may limit this use of your sensitive personal information and opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email, or by completing the [Personal Data Rights Request Form](https://themighty.com/privacy-request/) . Note, you may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.

**Verification of Identity**. We may need to verify your identity in order to process your information/know, access, correction, or deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your residency. To verify your identity, we may require you to authenticate into your Service account, provide personal identifiers we can match against information we may have collected from you previously, confirm your request using the email or telephone account stated in the request, provide government identification, provide a declaration under penalty of perjury, or provide other information, where permitted by law.

**Authorized Agents**. Your authorized agent may be able to make a request on your behalf. However, we may need to verify your authorized agent’s identity and authority to act on your behalf. We may require a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as by providing your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, the information we request to verify your identity, and confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

**Additional information for California residents**.
