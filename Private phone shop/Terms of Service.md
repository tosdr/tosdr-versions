By submitting such information, You grant us the right to provide the information to payment processing third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Your Order.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order at any time for certain reasons including but not limited to:

* Goods availability

### Your Order Cancellation Rights

Any Goods you purchase can only be returned in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and Our Returns Policy.

You have 30 days from the date of delivery to submit a return. You may do so using our return portal, located at [https://privatephoneshop.com/returns](https://privatephoneshop.com/returns). Any returns after this date may be denied, at our sole discretion.

If Goods are returned due to a physical defect or damage incurred during shipping, you will receive a full refund.

-------------------------------------

We are constantly updating Our offerings of Goods on the Service. The Goods available on Our Service may be mis-priced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and We may experience delays in updating information regarding our Goods on the Service and in Our advertising on other websites.

We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability, and services. We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

Prices Policy
-------------

The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time prior to accepting an Order.

The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the event of any occurrence affecting delivery caused by government action, variation in customs duties, increased shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs and any other matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You will have the right to cancel Your Order.

Payments
--------

All Goods purchased are subject to a one-time payment. Payment can be made through various payment methods we have available, such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express cards or online payment methods (PayPal, for example), or cryptocurrencies, or cash, check, or money order.

Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by Your card issuer. If we do not receive the required authorization, We will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of Your Order.

Any payment sent through the mail (cash, check, or money order) is done so at Your risk.  We will not be liable for non-receipt of payment.

---------------

Approximately one week after your order is shipped, we will send you an email soliciting a review of your purchase. You are not required to submit a review. Reviews can be anonymous if you so choose. You will only be emailed once regarding submission of a review. By making a purchase you consent to receiving an email soliciting a review.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven’t purchased anything through the Service.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party’s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

-------------------------------------

The Service is provided to You “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.

### Waiver

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Terms shall not effect a party’s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
