 Creator Code of Conduct
========================

Thank you for being part of the Rec Room creator community. We love seeing the things you create! As do the players who enjoy your rooms, your inventions, your custom avatar items, and so much more.

The Creator Code of Conduct provides "rules of the road" for creating in Rec Room under five broad themes. These rules are intended to foster a creative, inclusive, and positive community.

These rules apply to everyone (yes, including you!), and to any type of content you might create. That includes, but is not limited to: rooms, objects, inventions, images, videos, avatar items, text, events, clubs, keys, currencies, consumables, inventory items, offers, comments, the share screen. Basically anything and everything you create and share in Rec Room (or rec.net).

The Creator Code of Conduct is updated periodically as the world (and Rec Room) evolves. Revisions go into effect when posted and may be enforced immediately.

OK, let's dive in:

### **1\. Safety & Privacy**

The safety of our players and community is a top priority. Nothing in Rec Room should contain harmful or illegal content. Content that is not appropriate for players under 13 must be restricted from junior access. 

i. Depicting, promoting, or glorifying child abuse, exploitation, or endangerment is strictly prohibited with zero tolerance. We work with law enforcement if we identify such content. 

ii. Creations must not contain real acts or threats of violence or encourage harm against any individual or group, including self-harm and/or suicide. This includes, but is not limited to, representation and/or glorification of extremist or terrorist content. 

iii. We do not allow content that is sexually suggestive or fetishized. This includes nudity, sexual acts, sexualized situations or poses, references to or threats of sexual assault, groping, excessive exposed skin, or solicitation of sexual acts. Nor do we allow content that is aimed at facilitating real-world relationships, dating, sexual relationships, or sexualized romantic subjects. 

iv. Content which depicts, promotes or facilitates other illegal behavior, materials, or activities is prohibited. No content that is otherwise defamatory or obscene. 

v. Depictions of regulated or age restricted material or actions are prohibited including:

* Drugs, drug paraphernalia, and drug consumption;
    
* Gambling, casinos, lotteries; and 
    
* Tobacco or nicotine including cigarettes, e-cigarettes, vaping, oral pouches and hookah pipes. 
    

vi. Content must not contain personal information e.g. phone numbers or addresses. Website links are permitted, but must not violate restrictions in the Creator Code of Conduct. Links may be flagged by automated moderation systems; removing links will accelerate publication.

### **2\. Inclusivity**

We want the Roomiverse to be a fun and welcoming place for people from all walks of life. We expect everything our creators do to be compatible with Rec Room’s [Code of Conduct](https://recroom.com/code-of-conduct).

We prohibit: 

i. Racist, sexist, ableist, and xenophobic content, and content containing hate symbols, discriminatory, homophobic, or transphobic language or images.

ii. Content created to bully, harass, threaten, or share another person’s personal information.

iii. Content depicting real wars or conflicts, including specific country names or military operations. War and battle games should be generalized. 

iv. Depictions of excessive blood, gore, or graphic violence.

### **3\. Honesty and Integrity**

Our goal is to create an environment built on trust, respect, and genuine connections:

i. Content permissions, roles and administration are the Creator’s responsibility to manage. Players are entitled to content they acquire or copy through legitimate permissions.

ii. Rec Room content that is obtained using cheats, exploits or external software is prohibited, including unauthorized cloning.

iii. Creators are responsible for moderating their rooms and maintaining fun spaces. 

iv. Transfer of content ownership between players is a private arrangement between the involved parties. Ownership transfers are final. Creators are responsible for understanding the terms and implications before initiating. Rec Room will not resolve or adjudicate private transfers. 

v. The destruction of others’ creations and art without their permission is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to (i) art and creation griefing and (ii) content destruction with attempts to prevent content recovery.

vi. Requesting subscriptions, favorites, and cheers in exchange for bonuses, room or event perks, or external offers is prohibited.

vii. Content that disrupts or interferes with the proper functioning of other players’ games is prohibited.

### **4\. Fair & Ethical Economy**

Another place where trust is crucial is economic transactions. For our creators to flourish, the Rec Room economy must be healthy and sustainable:

i. No exploitative or misleading monetization or mechanics. It must be clear what a player is purchasing. We prohibit:

* Loops, traps, and spamming of 'purchase prompts';
    
* Deceptive practices, scams, or unexpected removal of purchased or awarded content; 
    
* Attempts to defraud or manipulate the Rec Room monetization system; 
    
* Rooms and events promoting giveaways, raffles, lotteries, or contests involving any real currency, virtual currency, Rec Tokens, “free gifts”, or permission offerings (selling co-owner, moderator, host, or other permissions in rooms);
    
* Rooms containing gambling, casino-style games or games of chance involving currency.
    

ii. Charity fundraisers involving the use of Rec Tokens are not allowed. Links or directions to off-platform charity sites are permissible as long as the site does not violate these rules. 

iii. Using exploits, bots, alternate accounts, or other unfair methods to maintain a spot on any promotional page is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to activities such as:

* Repeated rescheduling of events;
    
* Reposting exact or similar clones of the same room;
    
* Spam publishing or republishing rooms;
    
* Abuse of the tagging system.
    

### **5\. Intellectual Property & Content Integrity**

Respecting copyright and intellectual property rights in all in-game creations is required:

i. Thumbnails and descriptions must reflect the content advertised. Content with intentionally misleading names, thumbnails, or descriptions are prohibited. 

ii. Owners are responsible for securing permission to use any content, thumbnails, or metadata for their content that is not their original work. 

iii. Content must not infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party's intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy.

Interventions
-------------

Here's what we can do if you breach any of the above rules:

* Removal of your content and consequential token loss for sold content;
    
* Temporary or permanent removal of creation privileges, including the ability to monetize;
    
* Temporary or permanent removal of your ability to exchange tokens for real-world currency; 
    
* Account bans.
    

Enforcement of these rules is at our discretion. We reserve the right to modify all or any part of these rules at any time. The Creator Code of Conduct is in addition to all restrictions contained in our Code of Conduct and our [Terms of Service](https://recroom.com/terms-of-service).
