License and Terms of Use
========================

**Last updated: July 10, 2022.**

Thanks for choosing Aura Identity Guard. We’re here to create a safer internet by making comprehensive digital security simple to understand and easy to use. In this document, we’ll outline in detail what we provide you, our customers, and each of our legal obligations. The details contained in this document will be collectively referred to as the “Terms.”

Here is a quick breakdown of the Terms:

Who is Aura Identity Guard?

"Aura Identity Guard", “Aura”, "We" or "Us" means Aura Sub, LLC and certain of our affiliates. These Terms represent a binding contract between you and Aura Identity Guard.

When do these terms apply?

These Terms apply to your use of any Aura Identity Guard products or services offered by Aura Identity Guard as described in these Terms (collectively, the “Services”), including all software provided as a part of our Services (the “Software”), whether through the website found at https://www.identityguard.com or a mobile application, or in any other manner.

These Terms apply anytime you:

(i) create an account in connection with the Services;

(ii) download or use any Software in connection with the Services;

(iii) use the Services or interact with Aura Identity Guard in connection with the Services in any other way.

If you are accepting these terms as a result of your purchase of a subscription via an Aura authorized reseller (“Aura Authorized Reseller”) (e.g. CenturyLink Cyber Shield Service), you understand and agree that such Aura Authorized Reseller and its affiliates are responsible for the sale of the Services (“Authorized Reseller Services”), and rates, charges, billing, and payment for the Authorized Reseller Services. In the event of any conflict between these terms of service and the Subscriber agreement that you agreed to at the time of purchase of the Authorized Reseller Services, the Subscriber agreement will control for billing and payment related matters, and for all other matters, these Terms will be applicable and binding.

How do you agree to our terms?

You are agreeing to these Terms when you sign up for or use the Services and any time you access or use the Services. We encourage you to read our Terms carefully, specifically the automatic renewal terms and mandatory arbitration, which significantly affect your legal rights.

**IN PARTICULAR, THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES U.S. USERS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH AURA IDENTITY GUARD OR ITS AFFILIATES THROUGH ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. SEE SECTION 2.12 BELOW FOR THE DETAILS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.**

What is covered by these Terms?

To make it easier to understand, we’ve divided our legal terms into four parts:

(1) Billing, Cancellation, and Refund Policies: This covers terms related to billing, automatic renewals, cancellation, and refunds, when billing is handled by Aura Identity Guard. Separate terms may apply if you didn’t purchase the Services directly from Aura Identity Guard.

(2) General Legal Terms: This covers the general legal terms that make up the contractual relationship between you and Aura Identity Guard such as eligibility, user accounts, binding arbitration, and indemnification.

(3) Service-Specific Terms: These are terms that apply to the specific Services that Aura Identity Guard is providing to you. You may not receive all Services listed herein if you didn’t purchase the Services directly from Aura Identity Guard.

(4) License Terms: These are terms that govern how we give you a license to access and use the Services.

### Part 1. Automatic Renewals And Billing

1.1 Subscription

Our Services are generally billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription”). If applicable and you elect to enroll in a Subscription, you will be billed in advance for your Subscription on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). The length of your Billing Cycle will depend on the Subscription you select. Billing Cycles will typically consist of one (1) month or one (1) year terms (“Subscription Term”). You agree to pay for the Subscription that you select. You also authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file based on the Billing Cycle applicable to your Subscription.

1.2 Automatic Renewals

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew for an additional Billing Cycle at the price shown in your account dashboard or otherwise communicated to you by us (“Renewal Price”) unless: (a) you or we have canceled your Subscription at least one (1) day prior to the commencement of your next Billing Cycle or in accordance with Section 1.4 below, or (b) an event under Section 1.6 occurs in which case we will give you prior notice according to that Section. We will email you in advance to let you know your Subscription is due for renewal and provide the renewal price in your account dashboard. You may cancel your Subscription by contacting us via the phone number or email address in your account dashboard which at the time of publishing is 1-855-993-3061 and [\[email protected\]](https://www.identityguard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), or by logging into your account.

Once we or you have canceled your Subscription, your recurring subscription fees for the Services will no longer be charged to the payment method we have on file for your account, and your Subscription will remain active only until the end of the current Billing Cycle.

You may also be eligible for a refund depending on the specific plan and offer you subscribed to in accordance with the applicable section(s) below.

1.3 Plan Switching

In the event Aura allows you to switch your Aura Identity Guard Subscription plan and you choose to do so, we will send you an email confirming the plan change, and reflect any credit or amount owed due to the difference in changing plans, and the Billing Cycle for the new plan. Your plan switch will be effective as of the date shown in your account profile and confirmation email, which will generally be tied to the date you elect to switch your plan.

1.4 Money Back Guarantee

Certain Services may include a Money Back Guarantee if you are not satisfied for any reason. If a Money Back Guarantee is offered for the Services, the terms of the Money Back Guarantee will be visible in your account profile.

1.5 Payment Methods

A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide us or our third-party payment processor with accurate and complete billing information which may include full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Unless we expressly provide otherwise, all amounts paid are non-refundable. You further agree to be responsible for any applicable state, federal or other taxes that may be associated with the Services, including sales taxes, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by your financial institution and intermediaries. All amounts are in U.S. Dollars.

If the billing method you provide is a credit or debit card (“Payment Card”), you:

(a) represent that you are authorized to use such Payment Card;

(b) authorize us to charge your Payment Card periodically for the Subscription fees when due, including upon sign up for the Services and each subsequent Billing Cycle;

(c) agree to keep your Payment Card details valid and current; and

(d) agree to pay any processing fees that are charged by the third-party payment processors or Payment Card issuer.

If your Payment Card is declined when we attempt to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time. If we do not receive payment, we may suspend or terminate your Subscription.

1.6 Fee Changes

We may change the fees that we charge for the Services at any time at our sole discretion, provided that we will give you at least thirty (30) days of prior notice of such changes. Unless otherwise specified in such notice to you, any changes to the Subscription fees will take effect in the Billing Cycle immediately following our notice to you.

1.7 Aura Authorized Reseller Refund Policy

You may cancel your service at any time by calling 1-877-352-0863 or any other number provided to you by Aura Identity Guard or through your online account. If you enrolled in our Services as part of an employee benefits program, the following refund terms apply.

**Employee Benefits Voluntary User Program:** If you enrolled in our Services via an Employee Benefits Voluntary User Program (where you are offered to sign up and pay for the Services via payroll deduction), you must contact your employer to cancel the Service.      The disposition of any refunds is between you and your employer.

**Employee Benefits Employer Paid Program:** If you enrolled in our Services via an Employee Benefits Employer Paid Program (where the employer pays for the Services to be provided with an option for you to purchase additional Services via credit card purchase), any Services paid for by the employer will not result in any refund to you at time of cancellation.      If you purchased additional Services via credit card, no refunds are provided.  The Services will continue to be accessible until the last day of your current month’s billing cycle.

**Employee Benefits User Direct Enrollment Program:** If you enrolled in our Services via an Employee Benefits User Direct Enrollment Program (where you pay for the Services directly), no refunds are provided.  The Services will continue to be accessible until the last day of your current month’s billing cycle.

**Other Reseller Programs**: If you enrolled in our Services via Other Reseller Programs, no refunds are provided by Aura. The Services will continue to be accessible until the last day of your current month’s billing cycle. Should you have questions, please contact your Reseller as any disposition of refunds, if owed, is between you and the Reseller.

### Part 2. General Legal Terms

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS – IF YOU RESIDE IN THE U.S. WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES WITH AURA IDENTITY GUARD AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGH ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. PLEASE REVIEW SECTION 2.12 OF THESE TERMS FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.

2.1 Eligibility

Our Services are not available to persons who are not Eligible or to any users previously suspended, terminated, or removed from the Services by Aura Identity Guard. “Eligible” means that (i) you are 18 years of age or above the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence (whichever is greater) or (ii) you are 13 years of age or older but under the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence and are using the Services with the permission and involvement of a parent or legal guardian who has agreed to these Terms. By downloading, using, or accessing the Services, you represent and warrant that you are Eligible. If you are a parent or legal guardian of either (1) a user under the age of majority or (2) a senior or elderly user (“Senior Member”) with limited use allowed under the Services, by allowing the Child Member and/or Senior Members (together, “Junior Members”) to use the Services on the Family Plan or through Parental Controls, you are acknowledging that you are subject to these Terms and responsible for the Junior Members’ activity on the Services. See more details below for the Family Plan and Parental Controls. Under no circumstances may anyone under 13 years of age use or access the Services at any time or in any manner or submit any information through the Services outside of the circumstances outlined in this section.

If you do not provide this information, if we cannot verify your identity or if our service providers are unable to successfully provide the features in the Subscription plan you’ve selected based on the information you have provided, we may refuse to allow you to use certain features (for example, some credit based features), and we may automatically enroll you in a version of our Services that has fewer features (for example, only including non-credit features).

2.2 User Data, Accounts and Passwords

You are fully and solely responsible and liable for the content and data you enter into our Services. Registration as a user or subscriber with the Services may require both a user name and a password, and certain portions of the Services may require the use of multiple one-time or persistent passwords. You should consider your user names and passwords as confidential information. Anyone with knowledge of both your user name and password can gain access to the restricted portions of the Services and your account. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Services or third-party service.

2.3 User Submissions, Feedback; Beta Features; Updates

If you submit to Aura Identity Guard feedback and/or reviews, suggestions, comments, or ideas relating to the Services (“Submissions”), you are granting to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law to Aura Identity Guard and its affiliated companies a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, unlimited, nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the Submission in any media or medium, or any form, format, or forum, now known or hereafter developed, to improve or market the Services or for any other reasonable business purpose.

You agree that: (i) all content of your Submissions must be accurate; (ii) you will not provide a Submission that is known by you to be false, inaccurate or misleading and/or may be reasonably considered to be defamatory, libelous, hateful, offensive, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing to anyone; (iii) you will not provide a Submission that infringes a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (iv) you will not provide a Submission that violates any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (v) you will not provide a Submission for which you were compensated or granted any consideration by any third party; (vi) you shall not provide any Submission that includes information that references other websites, addresses, email addresses, contact information, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information for anyone; and (vii) you will not provide a Submission that contains any potentially damaging computer programs or files.

Also we may, in our sole discretion, include new and/or updated beta features in the Services for your use and which permit you to provide feedback via mechanisms that Aura Identity Guard offers for your feedback. Using beta features may subject you to the payment of fees. You understand and agree that your use of the beta features is voluntary. The beta features are provided on an “as is” basis and you acknowledge and agree that all use of beta features is at your personal risk. Certain beta features may be subject to additional terms or an agreement.

We may from time to time develop and provide updates for the Services, which may include upgrades, bug fixes, patches and other error corrections and/or new features, functionality, tools or content (collectively, “Updates”).

2.9 Limitation of Liability and Damages

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, AURA IDENTITY GUARD AND THE AURA IDENTITY GUARD ENTITIES WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE OR PROFIT OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM PERSONAL INJURY/WRONGFUL DEATH) ARISING CONCERNING YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Accordingly, Aura Identity Guard assumes no liability for or relating to the delay, failure, interruption, or corruption of any data or other information transmitted in connection with the use of the Services.

NEITHER AURA IDENTITY GUARD, CSID, EQUIFAX, TRANSUNION, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU AS AN AGENT IN OBTAINING COPIES OF ANY OF YOUR CREDIT REPORT, CREDIT ALERT REPORT, QUARTERLY UPDATE, OR CREDIT SCORE. NEITHER AURA IDENTITY GUARD, CSID, EQUIFAX, TRANSUNION, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR CREDIT INFORMATION SUBCONTRACTORS MAKE ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, FOR THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OR PROVIDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AURA IDENTITY GUARD SERVICES. NEITHER AURA IDENTITY GUARD, CSID, EQUIFAX, TRANSUNION, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL, IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR REQUEST, USE, OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE SERVICES. NEITHER AURA IDENTITY GUARD NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR CREDIT INFORMATION SUBCONTRACTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NEGATIVE FACTUAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ANY REPORTS YOU RECEIVE AS PART OF THE SERVICE. THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ALL SUCH PARTIES TO YOU, IN ANY EVENT, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT WHICH YOU HAVE PAID AURA IDENTITY GUARD FOR YOUR MEMBERSHIP. AURA IDENTITY GUARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE NOT A CREDIT COUNSELING SERVICE AND DO NOT PROMISE TO HELP YOU OBTAIN A LOAN OR IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT RECORD, HISTORY, OR RATING. THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION, CANCELLATION, OR EXPIRATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

2.10 Basis of the Bargain

You acknowledge and agree that Aura Identity Guard has offered the Services, set its prices, and entered into these Terms in reliance upon the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein, that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and Aura Identity Guard, and that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of the bargain between you and Aura Identity Guard. Aura Identity Guard would not be able to provide the Services to you on an economically reasonable basis without these limitations.

2.11 Government Use

This Section 2.11 applies where the Services are provided for the benefit of a U.S. governmental end-user.  As defined in FAR section 2.101, the Services are “commercial items” and according to FAR 12.212 and DFARS section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and (5) are deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation.” Consistent with FAR section 12.212 and DFARS section 227.7202, any use modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such commercial software or commercial software documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms.

2.12 Dispute Resolution By Binding Individual Arbitration

Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.

(A) Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by contacting us via the phone number or email address in your account dashboard which at the time of publishing is 1-855-993-3061 and [\[email protected\]](https://www.identityguard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). In the unlikely event that customer service is unable to resolve a complaint you may have with Aura Identity Guard or Aura Identity Guard’s service Provider(s) to your satisfaction (or if Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service Provider(s) have not been able to resolve a dispute with you after attempting to do so informally), you, on the one hand, and Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s), on the other, each agree to resolve those disputes under the Arbitration Agreement contained in this Section 2.12. The Arbitration Agreement requires you to resolve all disputes (other than those expressly exempted in this Section 2.12) through binding arbitration on an individual basis, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction to the fullest extent permitted by law. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.      Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.      Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.      We will pay all costs of arbitration, no matter who wins, so long as your claim is not frivolous. However, in arbitration, you, on the one hand, and Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s), on the other, will be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees to the same extent they would be available in court.

(B) **Arbitration Agreement** – You, on the one hand, and Aura Identity Guard and/or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s), on the other, agree that any claim or dispute ("Claim") between us shall, at the election of any one of us, be resolved by binding arbitration ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules for consumer arbitrations, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA and appear at adr.org. Aura Identity Guard can also help put you in touch with the AAA. The parties intend that this agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) be construed broadly, such that this Arbitration Agreement includes any Claims by you against Aura Identity Guard or Aura Identity Guard’s service provider(s) as well as their respective corporate affiliates for any claims, disputes, or causes of action related in any way to (i) your use of the Services or (ii) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, applicability, or validity of these Terms or any part of them (including this Arbitration Agreement).

You agree that, by entering into these Terms or otherwise using the Services, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. At your request, we will promptly reimburse you for the payment of your arbitration filing fee. (The filing fee for consumers currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.  If you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly after receiving a written request). The arbitrator shall be authorized to award whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, other than relief reserved for the courts by law or statute. YOU, ON ONE HAND, AND AURA IDENTITY GUARD AND/OR AURA IDENTITY GUARD’S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Aura Identity Guard agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision in the preceding sentence is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The parties to these Terms acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement is made according to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ("FAA"), except to the extent state law provides defenses or exceptions not preempted by the FAA. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitrator shall follow substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA and shall honor any claims or privileges recognized by law.      The terms of this Section 2.12 shall survive any termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement.

**Exceptions to Arbitration**: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following claims are not subject to this Arbitration Agreement, provided that they are brought and maintained as individual claims and not in any class, consolidated, or representative capacity: (1) claims you may have which relate to your credit report, or any claims arising out of or relating to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and/or the FCRA’s state law equivalent(s) or (2) claims properly lodged in a small claims court of the United States.

3.2 Secure VPN

Our Secure VPN Services generally provide sufficient capacity to accommodate average non-commercial use. It is possible that you may temporarily experience slower service or service unavailability, and any such temporary slowdown or unavailability will not constitute a breach or default by us of our obligations. Aura Identity Guard reserves the right to prevent your access to the Service or continued use thereof if you violate this Agreement, engage in fraud or copyright infringement.

If we observe that: (a) your usage level exceeds our average customer use level or otherwise negatively impacts the overall health of the network or (b) you exceed any bandwidth limitations associated with your account, all as determined by Aura Identity Guard in its sole discretion, then we may suspend or cancel your account for clarification or investigation.

The Identity Theft Protection Services, including features such as monitoring your credit profile, providing insurance for eligible identity theft claims, and monitoring certain publicly available registries maintained by local law enforcement agencies for your information, are only available to users who have a U.S. Social Security Number and a U.S. mailing address. You agree that you will use these Services only for your own behalf, except if you are enrolled in the Family Plan in which case each adult member of the Family Plan agrees to the requirements in this Section. You will be responsible for all use of your membership number and if applicable for a Junior Member that you enroll for Identity Theft Protection services under the Family Plan, for any Junior Member’s membership number (together, “Membership Number”). You must notify Aura Identity Guard immediately of any unauthorized use of any Membership Number, or the theft or misplacement of a Membership Number.  

Authorization: You understand that by enrolling in the Services, you are providing "written instructions" in accordance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended ("FCRA"), for Aura Identity Guard and its service providers, which may include CSIdentity Corporation (“CSID”), Equifax Inc. (“Equifax”), and TransUnion, LLC (“TransUnion”)  to obtain information from your personal credit profile from Experian, Equifax, and Transunion, the three major credit reporting agencies. You authorize Aura Identity Guard and its service providers to use your Social Security number to access your personal credit profile, verify your identity, and provide credit monitoring, reporting, and scoring products. Further, you authorize Aura Identity Guard to make any inquiries necessary to verify your identity or your ownership of financial or other accounts relevant to your use of the Services. This may include, without limitation, making inquiries through third-party sources or requiring you to provide additional information or documentation. If we are unable to verify your identity or otherwise obtain your credit information from a credit reporting agency, we will be unable to provide certain Services to you and reserve the right to refuse to offer some or all of the Services to you, downgrade or cancel your Subscription, as applicable.

Insurance: Identity theft insurance is governed by a master policy, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The issuance of the policy is evidenced by an insurance certificate, [summary of benefits](https://www.aura.com/insurance), or other similar document that has been provided to you. You acknowledge receipt of this information and agree to be bound by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the policy. To view these Terms and our website, you must use a supported browser. You may obtain a paper copy of these disclosures by .

Credit Report-Related Disclosures for US Residents: The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to obtain a disclosure from every credit reporting agency of the nature and substance of all information in your file at the time of the request. Full disclosure of information in your file at Transunion, Equifax, or Experian must be obtained directly.

* For Experian, call 888-397-3742 or log on to www.experian.com
* For Transunion, call 800-816-880 or log on to www.transunion.com
* For Equifax, call 888-378-4329 or log on to https://my.equifax.com

The credit report you are requesting from Aura Identity Guard is not intended to constitute the disclosure of Experian, Equifax, or Transunion information required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar state laws. You are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer reporting agencies free of charge under the following circumstances:

a. You have been denied credit, insurance or employment within the past sixty (60) days as a result of your credit report.

b. You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the date on which I made the certification.

c. You are a recipient of public welfare assistance

d. You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud

e. Annually at [www.annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com/)

Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for the disclosure.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act permits you to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit file. You understand that accurate information cannot be changed. You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from Aura Identity Guard to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in my Experian file or to receive a copy of your Experian consumer credit report.

Experian’s National Consumer Assistance Center provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided by Aura Identity Guard. The disclosure report must be obtained directly from Experian. Consumers residing in the States of Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont may receive a free copy of their consumer credit report once per year and residents of the State of Georgia may receive two copies per year.

Fraud Alerts are available to any eligible consumers—free of charge—from a national consumer reporting agency.

NOTICE TO ILLINOIS RESIDENTS: MANY GOVERNMENT RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE FREE OR AT A NOMINAL COST FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO GIVE YOU A COPY OF YOUR CREDIT RECORD UPON REQUEST AT NO CHARGE OR FOR A NOMINAL FEE.

The Services are not intended to substitute for any free credit report or disclosure that any credit reporting agency or bureau is required by law to provide to you. Neither you nor anyone else has the right to have accurate and current information removed from your credit report. If information in your credit report is inaccurate, you have the right to dispute it by contacting the credit bureau directly.

VANTAGESCORE 3.0 CREDIT SCORE: VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, Experian®, TransUnion®, and Equifax®. VantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.

There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Credit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day. Different credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.

There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers. Your lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that's different from your VantageScore. (And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores). Just remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not. For some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lender’s score. If the lender's score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.

Certain Public Records Monitoring: The sex offender (“Offender”) information that is used for a specific feature for the Services to monitor for if your information is added to a sex offender registry is derived from official public records. As such, the accuracy of the information provided through the Services may vary based upon the accuracy of such official public records. In certain cases, we may not obtain all the address information associated with the Offender who is contained in the public record. Aura Identity Guard has no control over the contents of official public records. If you believe the information found using this feature is incorrect, please contact the local police department in the applicable jurisdiction for assistance. That police department will be able to assist you directly or refer you to the appropriate authority.

3.4 Data Broker Opt Out

If you sign up for the Data Broker Opt Out Services, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

(i) On your behalf, Aura Identity Guard will make reasonable efforts to have your personal information that you provided to us removed or suppressed (“opt-out”), in whole or in part, from approximately 20 third party databases and/or websites (the “Data Brokers”), a list of whom is available upon request.  You understand that we will only be able to submit opt outs for the information you provide to us.

(ii) You expressly authorize Aura Identity Guard, its agents, and its employees, to act as your personal representative or authorized agent to submit opt outs to Data Brokers and otherwise implement the Services, Services and if applicable and available to you, for any Junior Members under the Family Plan, including by acting to:

* obtain information on your behalf;
* submit your personal information to Data Brokers;
* communicate with Data Brokers or other third parties on your behalf;
* take any other actions that Aura Identity Guard believes is reasonably necessary to opt you out of a Data Broker.

(iii) The extent of the opt-out will vary based on the Data Broker, and its terms and practices. It is possible that some Data Brokers may contact you to confirm your request and/or to request additional information; and in such an event, our ability to remove your information will depend on your response to them.

(iv) You can personally opt out to these Data Brokers to the same extent that Aura Identity Guard submits the opt out on your behalf. Aura Identity Guard makes no claims that it has any ability to opt you out of any Data Broker beyond your ability to do so on your own behalf.

(v) Aura Identity Guard is under no obligation to and will not pay any fees to a Data Broker in order to opt you out.

(vi) You must give us authority to act only on your behalf and not on behalf of any person other than yourself except if applicable and offered to you, as a feature under the Family Plan for a Junior Member. If you give us information that we know, discover, or suspect is false or inaccurate, or relates to another person that is not a Member, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Services and reserve the right to, where we deem it appropriate, report such conduct to law enforcement and other third parties, and to cooperate in the investigation of such conduct.

(vii) We are not liable to you for the manner in which a Data Broker treats or uses your personal information. A Data Broker’s treatment or use of your information will be subject to the Data Broker’s policies, if any, and not these Terms or the Aura Identity Guard Privacy Policy.

(viii) While we will make reasonable efforts to remove your information, the success of the Services is ultimately dependent on the cooperation of the Data Brokers. We cannot and do not guarantee that the Services will be effective, that opt out requests will be honored by Data Brokers, or that all opt outs will be equivalent (e.g., some Data Brokers may remove all of the information included in the opt out submitted, while other may remove only some or none at all). We are not responsible for the actions or inactions of any Data Broker, and make no representations, warranties or guarantees related to such. You expressly agree that we will not be liable to you under any circumstances for any actions or inactions of the Data Brokers, or for our failure, for any reason, to effectuate opt outs on your behalf.

Our Additional Title Monitoring services send a notification to you if we identify an ownership or other change on the title to your monitored property based on the applicable records kept by the relevant authorities such as by your county’s assessor or recorder’s office. If you receive a notification, you will need to contact your relevant authority to get more detailed information and/or correct their records. Our Additional Title Monitoring is offered as a notice-only service and Additional Title Monitoring does not include any Identity Theft Remediation Services (discussed in Section 3.8 below) or identity theft event insurance (discussed in Section 3.3 above), or any other services whatsoever, for any ownership or other changes to the titles available for monitoring through our Additional Title Monitoring Services.

These Services are dependent upon the records maintained by the relevant authorities such as your county’s assessor or recorder’s office. As such, the accuracy of the information provided through the Services may vary based upon the accuracy of such records. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any inaccuracies or errors in such records, or for the absence of any information in such records.

3.8 Identity Theft Remediation

In order for us to provide our Identity Theft Remediation Services, you must provide us with a signed Limited Power of Attorney ("LPOA") in the form that we will send to you. A LPOA form may be sent to you after you contact our customer support team which you will be required to complete and return in accordance with the instructions enclosed. The LPOA allows us to work on your behalf with creditors, merchants, banks and other entities. You may also be required to provide us with other documents relating to the applicable identity theft event, depending on the circumstances.

In addition, separate and apart from the LPOA, you authorize us to take all reasonable actions on your behalf to help restore your identity. Without limiting the immediately foregoing sentence, by agreeing to these Terms, you are providing “written instructions” for us to obtain information on a recurring basis from any consumer reporting agency in order to (i) confirm your identity, (ii) display or disclose your credit information to you and/or your designated representative related to your use of the applicable Services, (iii) allow us to create and deliver certain features of the Services to you, and (iv) permit us to monitor your credit file(s) so that we can provide to you and/or your designated representative certain fraud alerts and provide assistance in reviewing certain portions of your credit data. You acknowledge and agree that you do not have to specifically authorize each action we take, and you further acknowledge that we can investigate the facts and circumstances related to your identity theft case, including but not limited to contacting third parties by U.S. mail, telephone, and email. We reserve the right to ask for evidence of or related to the identity theft event, including but not limited to: affidavits, police reports, and/or other government reports.

3.9 Additional Members; Family Plans including Parental Controls

Some Services, such as our Family Plan, may allow you to register your family members or their devices to use the Services, enable you to add other adults and children living at the same address as you, or help you monitor and manage the online activities of children up to 18 years old. If you are enrolling a parent or senior, minor or child, spouse or domestic partner, you agree that the information you provide to Aura Identity Guard about yourself or about the third party is true and accurate, and you are duly authorized to provide this information, and in certain cases such as the case of minors, to monitor their accounts, on their behalf. You further agree to these Terms on their behalf.  If requested, you agree to provide documentation necessary in our sole discretion to prove your relationship with any minor child or other people on your account. You further acknowledge and agree that subject to our then-current customer authentication procedures, another adult customer enrolled on your account may authorize changes to the account, including termination of your subscription or changes resulting in added charges.

Applicable Services may be only accessed and used by or on behalf of parents, in-laws, spouses/domestic partners, and/or minor children (for whom you are the legal guardian or parent)/ If you are an adult legal guardian, you may use the Services to track and monitor only your children, children for whom you are the legal guardian or others for whom you have legal authorization to track and monitor. By enrolling a child as part of the Family Plan, you represent and affirm that (a) you are the custodial parent or legal guardian of each child you register, (b) any documentation that you provide asserting the same is valid, (c) each child that you register legally resides at your address of record, and (d) that as required, you are able and willing to provide a copy of (i) your valid driver's license, (ii) your child's social security card, (iii) your child's birth certificate, and (iv) any other documentation required to verify proof of legal guardianship. You agree to notify us in the event that the status of your legal guardianship changes; we reserve the right to cancel each child upon such status change. Enrollment of any child in Family Plan will be canceled upon any child becoming 18 years old and the primary member may then invite the adult (former child) to join his/her Family Plan.

The parental controls Services (“Parental Controls”) are expressly designed for parents to monitor the Internet and mobile activity of their children and are designed to be administered by adults on behalf of a family or community. The primary user in a Family Plan with Parental Controls selected is solely responsible for any activity or actions in their Family Plan account resulting from the use of their log-in credentials on the Services, whether or not the primary user has authorized such activities or actions. You acknowledge that use of the Parental Controls feature does not guarantee that content you deem objectionable will be 100% unavailable at all times or at any time. You assume full risk and responsibility for the use of or reliance on the Parental Controls feature as regards content blocking. “False positive” content blocking may occur from time to time or at any time. We strive to allow sufficiently granular control of content filters to allow educational or meritorious content through, if that is the intent of the user. However, there is no guarantee that some content that you would deem acceptable will not be blocked by the Parental Control feature. In the event that you believe we are miscategorizing a site or service, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.identityguard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to submit the issue for review. Use of the Parental Control features may include “reward” activities for users who are seeking to ensure that their children or other dependents are successfully completing tasks. As an example, a user may condition access to web content on the successful completion of homework or chores. Aura Identity Guard does not monitor, nor can it verify, user activity with respect to such reward activities. We make no representations about the effectiveness of such methods.

3.10 Anti-Virus/Malware Removal

If your Subscription includes our [Anti-Virus](https://www.aura.com/legal/aura-antivirus-software-license-and-terms-of-service) or Malware Removal Services, or a similar service whereby we or one of our partners access your device to attempt removal of malware or perform other specified services, additional terms may apply. Such terms may be specified in the documents that accompanied your purchase.

We will make commercially reasonable efforts to perform the malware removal Services covered by your Subscription. You understand and agree that not all malware can be removed through the Services and we do not guarantee that we can remove all malware from your device(s). To the extent permitted by applicable law, we will have no liability for loss of or recovery of data, software, or loss of use of system(s) or networks arising out of your use of these Services or any act or omission, including negligence, by us or our representatives. You agree that you have a valid and legal license to access and download the Services on your device(s) and that your use of the Internet is solely at your own risk. By electing to receive the Services, you confirm that you (i) have full access to your hardware and software for which you are purchasing the Services, and (ii) have completed a back-up onto separate media of any software or data on the hardware that may be impacted by the Services.

3.11 Safe Browsing

Our Safe Browsing Services provide information to guide users about certain risks that may be associated with a website. We do not control or assume responsibility for the content of the third-party sites, and some of the third-party sites may have content that you find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. THE SITE RATINGS PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE NOT A GUARANTEE OF ANY PARTICULAR SITE’S SPECIFIC PRACTICES OR TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND IN NO CASE DO THE RATINGS REPRESENT AN ENDORSEMENT BY US OF THE SITE’S CONTENT, SUBJECT MATTER, OVERALL QUALITY, OR USEFULNESS.

3.12 Mobile Messaging Alerts

Our Mobile Alert Services allow you to receive informational alerts related to the categories you select. If you do not wish to continue receiving these Services, you can reply “STOP” to any mobile message from us in order to opt out of the Services.

User Opt In: The Services allow users to receive SMS/MMS (“mobile”) alerts that include information related to your Subscription, such as, but not limited to, fraud monitoring alerts, credit score alerts, dark web activity alerts, etc. Users must affirmatively opt into these Services, such as by signing up online, or by texting a keyword to Aura Identity Guard’s short code in response to a call-to-action. Regardless of the opt-in method you utilized to receive the Services, you agree that these Terms apply to your participation in the Services. The mobile messaging service used by Aura Identity Guard to communicate with you does not have the capacity to randomly or sequentially generate telephone numbers.  Thus, Aura Identity Guard’s mobile messages are not sent to you by an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or “autodialer”).  Nevertheless, by signing up to receive mobile alerts from Aura Identity Guard, you agree to receive autodialed mobile messages and you understand that consent is not required to make any purchase from Aura Identity Guard.

Aura Identity Guard may also offer various applications or services that enable or incorporate transactional text messaging, including, but not limited to, one-to-one messaging, text-message receipts, and other informational alerts. By providing your mobile telephone number to Aura Identity Guard when presented with or informed of these Terms, you consent to receive non-marketing mobile messages to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, regardless of the technology utilized.

Cost and Frequency: Message and data rates may apply.  The Services involve recurring mobile messages, and additional mobile messages may be sent based on your interaction with Aura Identity Guard.

Contact Information: For support, text “HELP” to any Aura Identity Guard mobile message.  If at any time you forget what keywords are supported, you can also text "HELP" to 99754 and we will respond with instructions on how to contact us.  For all questions about the services provided by this short code, you can send an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.identityguard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

User Opt-Out and Additional Commands: To opt-out of receiving all mobile messages, reply “STOP” to any mobile message you received from Aura Identity Guard on your mobile device. This is the easiest and preferred method to opt out of receiving mobile messages from Aura Identity Guard. You may receive an additional mobile message confirming your decision to opt out. The Services may recognize or respond to additional commands and keyword queries. Thus, you may receive additional informational text messages based on your interaction with the Services, even after opting out of receiving the mobile alerts.  You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any prior opt-out attempt, you consent to receive further messages from or on behalf of Aura Identity Guard that result from your continued communication with the Services. Aura Identity Guard may also provide you instructions on how to rejoin receiving the Services’ recurring mobile alerts when you unsubscribe.  You agree that you are subject to the Terms, including any modifications thereto then in effect, when you resubscribe to the Services through any of the available options to do so.

MMS: The Services will send SMS MTs if your mobile device does not support MMS messaging.

Aura Identity Guard Warranty: Aura Identity Guard will not be liable for any delays or failures in the receipt of any messages connected with the Services. Delivery of messages is subject to effective transmission from your wireless service provider/network operator and is outside of Aura Identity Guard’s control.

Participating carriers: Aura Identity Guard engages various SMS related service providers to provide SMSs to you. It is possible that your phone carrier is not able to receive SMSs through Aura Identity Guard. The list of participating carriers and any charges by them are outside of Aura Identity Guard’s control.  No participating carrier shall be liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

Miscellaneous: You warrant and represent that you will not provide to Aura Identity Guard any telephone number that is not assigned to you, and that if you obtain a new telephone number, you will promptly notify Aura Identity Guard that your prior telephone number is no longer assigned to you.

3.13 Alias Email

Our Alias Email Services allow you to generate a random, “masked” email address to use when creating account credentials for third-party sites and services online. This allows you to create accounts with third-party sites and services while keeping your real email address private. Emails sent from the third-party service provider to the masked email address will be redirected to the email address associated with your Subscription. As such, the Services will not prevent your receipt of any unwanted emails sent by third parties. The sole function of the Services is to permit you to keep your email address private when creating an account online with a third party. We do not guarantee that the Services will be effective or functional for all third-party sites and services.

3.14 Experian CreditLock

By requesting an Experian CreditLock to be placed on your behalf, you are requesting to restrict most third party access to your Experian credit report. You acknowledge that your Experian credit report, when locked with Experian CreditLock, may still be accessible by third parties in certain instances deemed to be low-risk by Experian, including access to your Experian credit report by the following third parties: (1) You, as part of any Service offering Experian CreditLock as a benefit; (2) potential employers or insurance companies; (3) companies that have an existing credit relationship with you; (4) collection agencies acting on behalf of companies or individuals on a debt you may owe and related collection activities; (5) companies providing pre-screened credit card offers. Please understand that your Experian credit report will be unlocked if you cancel a Service that includes Experian CreditLock as a benefit, or downgrade to a Service that does not include Experian CreditLock as a benefit.

Your Experian CreditLock will restrict delivery of your Experian credit report only, and does not apply to your TransUnion or Equifax credit report. To lock or place a security freeze on your Equifax or TransUnion credit report, you will need to contact those bureaus directly. While Experian CreditLock may include some functionality similar to security freeze programs required under certain laws, you acknowledge that Experian CreditLock is a separate service from, and not equivalent to, such security freeze programs. For more information about the Experian security freeze program, please contact Experian at [https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html) or 1-888-EXPERIAN.

3.15 Password Manager

If a Password Manager is made available to you by Aura Identity Guard and you use this feature, it will help store your passwords for any websites that you elect to use it for and the browser extension for the Password Manager will periodically notify you to store your passwords with Aura Identity Guard when you’re browsing the Internet. We recommend you do not share the password to your Aura Identity Guard account with anyone, because anyone with access to your Aura Identity Guard account may be able to obtain access to your other passwords.

3.16 Certain Reseller Executive or Other Executive White Glove Plans

We may offer certain reseller executive or other executive white glove plans such as our Employee Benefits Executive Ultimate Plan. If you’re enrolled in one of our reseller executive or other executive white glove plans, you agree to the following:

* You agree that if you have voluntarily identified the person designated in the LPOA to interact with us, such delegation is binding and enforceable and we can rely on the instructions of such person on your behalf. You will be responsible for any and all actions of your delegate.
* In the event you wish to change your delegate, you will reach out to us and inform us of the change in writing.
* We will occasionally call the primary member or their delegate to follow up on certain high importance alerts, but it will be your responsibility to review alerts and contact us if they suspect fraud or need assistance.
* If it is included in your plan, your  insurance coverage for any identity theft protection related eligible losses will be up to USD $5 million. Please see [summary of benefits](https://www.aura.com/insurance) here for more details.
