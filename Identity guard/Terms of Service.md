We also reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue the Sites with or without notice at any time and without any liability to you.

Please note the arbitration provision set forth below, which may require you to arbitrate any claims you may have against Aura on an individual basis. EXCEPT WHERE AND TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC,  ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.

### 1\. Intellectual Property Ownership

The Sites contain copyrighted material, trademarks and other proprietary information, including comments, articles, information, catalogs, brochures, data, text, software, photos, video and graphics (“Content”). This Content is subject to copyrights owned by Aura and other individuals or entities and is protected by United States and international copyright laws. To make a complaint about a copyright violation on the Sites, email our [Copyright Agent](mailto:copyrightagent@intersections.com).

Additionally, the names, trademarks, service marks, and logos of Aura belong exclusively to Aura and are protected from reproduction, imitation, dilution or confusing or misleading uses under national and international trademark and copyright laws. All other trademarks, service marks, and logos (including third-party product names) are the property of their respective owners. The use or misuse of these trademarks is expressly prohibited, and nothing stated or implied on these Sites confers on you any license or right under any patent or trademark of Aura or any third party.

### 2\. Use of Aura Content

You may only use the Sites and the Content offered on the Sites only for INTERNAL OR PERSONAL purposes, and not for any commercial purposes.  Aura authorizes you to view or download a single copy of the material on the Sites solely for your internal or personal use so long as you do not remove the copyright and other proprietary rights notices that were contained in the Content. You may not use the Sites to sell a product or service; however, you may use them to obtain information about potentially engaging in business with us. You may not modify, publish, transmit, display, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works, or in any way exploit the Content of the Sites or any portion of such Content. You may not use any data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on the Content, frame any portion of the Sites or Content, or reproduce, reprint, copy, store, publicly display, broadcast, transmit, modify, translate, port, publish, sublicense, assign, transfer, sell, loan, or otherwise distribute the Content without our prior written consent. You may not circumvent any mechanisms included in the Content for preventing the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the Content.  

Any use of the Content not expressly permitted by these Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate U.S. or international copyright, trademark, and/or other laws.  You shall not use the Sites for any illegal purpose and you shall abide by all applicable local, state, provincial, territorial, national, and international laws and regulations.

If you violate these Terms of Use, your permission to use the Content automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of any portion of the Content.

### 3\. Contributor Disclosure

Certain contributors on the Sites are compensated to provide content on topics of interest to the Sites’ users. Contributions that contain endorsements of Aura products or services and are made by individuals with material connections to Aura will be identified as such. While such contributors may receive compensation, the content is editorial and based on their opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on those topics, services, or products.

The views and opinions expressed within Aura blogs belong purely to the authors. Any product, claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider, or party in question.

### 4\. User Submissions, Forums and Public Areas

Certain places within the Sites, such as forums, blog pages or other public areas, may allow users to post comments or communications that are publicly accessible and non-confidential. The content and communications posted within these areas is largely controlled by our users. Aura, or the party hosting such a public area, has no control over such content and cannot guarantee the accuracy or reliability of any such content or communications. Thus, the responsibility for what is posted on these pages of the Sites lies with each user — you alone are responsible for material you post.

Neither Aura nor any third-party host of such a public area claims ownership of any of the information or material that you transmit, distribute, post, communicate, or store on, to, or through the Sites. Therefore, by submitting any such material or communication to the Sites, you warrant that you own or otherwise control all the rights to any content or communications submitted by you to the Sites and that you will not upload or transmit any communications or content of any type that infringes upon or violates any rights of any party. By submitting communications or content to any part of the Sites, you agree that such submission is non-confidential and is not otherwise protected by any other law, including privacy, publicity, copyright or trademark law.

By submitting communications or content to a public area of the Sites, you agree that such submission is non- confidential for all purposes. You agree to allow Aura and all other persons or organizations involved in the operation of the Sites the right to transmit, monitor, retrieve, store, and use your information in connection with the operation of the Sites. Aura and/or one of its agents or partners reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to investigate the Sites or your use of the Sites in order to (a) determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use has occurred, (b) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to (c) remove any postings, profiles, and to terminate your ability to post to the service at any time without notice, in its sole discretion. Aura also reserves the right to disclose any information necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials in whole or in part.

Any use of the Content not expressly permitted by these Terms of Use is a breach of these Terms of Use and may violate U.S. or international copyright, trademark, and/or other laws.

### 5\. License Grant

If you make any submission to or communications on the Sites, you automatically grant, or warrant that the owner of such content has expressly granted Aura, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, unlimited, nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display the communication or content material in any media or medium, or any form, format, or forum now known or hereafter developed.

### 16\. Choice of Law

These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, exclusive of its choice of law principles.

PLEASE NOTE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE: (1) WAIVING CLAIMS THAT YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE AGAINST US BASED ON THE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING YOUR OWN; (2) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTING TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF, AND VENUE IN, STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA OVER ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS YOU HAVE WITH US; AND (3) SUBMITTING YOURSELF TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTES OR CLAIMS, ALL SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW.

### 17\. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE

Except where and to the extent prohibited by law, which may include the province of Quebec,  Aura and/or You may elect to resolve any and all claims and disputes relating in any way to the Sites and these Terms of Use or any of our dealings with one another (“Claims”), except for Claims concerning the validity, scope or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”), through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.  This Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”), and not by state law. If you or we elect to resolve a dispute by arbitration, neither you nor we will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration. Other rights that you and we would have if you or we went to court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights. You and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL. IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION, THAT DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING. The arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties. Arbitrations shall be administered by the JAMS (“JAMS”) pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated. You may obtain information about arbitration, arbitration procedures and fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting [http://www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/).   If JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA. The arbitration shall take place at a location that is reasonably convenient for you. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitrator’s authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein. No arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. You and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not limited to affiliated companies and vendors. This Arbitration Agreement shall take precedence over the rules of the arbitration organization or arbitrator in the event of any conflict. We will be responsible for paying all arbitration fees other than the lower amount of filing fees you would have incurred in a state or federal court. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, you or we may seek relief in a small claims court for Claims within its jurisdiction. In addition, you and we each may exercise any lawful rights to seek provisional remedies or self-help, without waiving the right to arbitrate by doing so. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the foregoing class action waiver and prohibition against class arbitration is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be void. If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement other than the class action waiver and prohibition against class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of these Terms of Use, your fulfillment or default of your obligations under these Terms of Use, and/or your or our bankruptcy or insolvency (to the extent permitted by applicable law). YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, BUT YOU MUST EXERCISE THIS RIGHT PROMPTLY. If you do not wish to be bound by this agreement to arbitrate, you must notify us in writing within sixty (60) days after the date you agree to these Terms of Use, including this Agreement. You must send your request to: Customer Service, P.O. Box 222455, Chantilly, VA 20153-2455. The request must include your full name, address, account number, and the statement “I reject the Arbitration Agreement contained in the Website Terms of Use.” If you exercise your right to reject arbitration, the other terms of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect as if you had not rejected arbitration.

### 18\. Termination

We shall have the right to immediately terminate these Terms of Use with respect to any user which we, in our sole discretion, consider to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by you of these Terms of Use. The provisions of Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18 shall survive termination of this agreement.
