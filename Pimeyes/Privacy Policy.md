The aforementioned data is processed for the express purpose of responding to a request, even when the legal provisions require the establishment of a request procedure, as well as for the purposes related to the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.

We have to share personal data provided by You with the aim of having photos selected by You removed from external websites.

To understand what personal data these Entities collect and store, please refer to the respective Entities’ terms and privacy policy. This Entities handle the personal data of Our Users in its own capacity, with the sole purpose of executing the payment process.

The merchant of records provides PimEyes with essential data regarding the status of the User's payment, such as the success or failure of the transaction, as well as the geographic location from which the payment was initiated. PimEyes then utilises this data to facilitate the registration of the payment and ultimately to provide the requested service to Our Users.

These specific personal details pertaining to the User, are essential to PimEyes for the purpose of establishing, exercising, or defending their legal rights and interests. Furthermore, this data is also required for billing purposes, in order to accurately and effectively process payment transactions.

**3\. Data collected in PimEyes’ index:**

PimEyes, akin to conventional search engines, provides a service to the User by utilising its unique index. Specifically, the search engine indexes "fingerprints" of faces found on the Internet with the sole purpose of facilitating future searches. PimEyes does not engage in targeted searches for any particular individual, but rather indexes images that are openly available on the Internet, along with corresponding data about their respective sources. Notably, PimEyes does not undertake any action to confirm the identities of the persons depicted in the indexed photos, whom this policy refers to as "unidentified entities."

In pursuit of creating an index that relies on publicly available sources, PimEyes processes the indexed data. The objective is to provide a high-quality service to Users in the future.

When presenting the search results, PimEyes employs a secure on-the-fly process, also known as a proxy, to download and display images from external websites. These images are stored for a temporary period not exceeding 30 calendar days and are instantaneously deleted upon being exhibited.

Data which is processed in the PimEyes index stems from sources that are publicly accessible. During the collection of such data, PimEyes abides by the distinct regulations of each website accessed by PimEyesBot web robots and only downloads data from sites which officially allow data scrapping.

PimEyes presents images from external websites, but the content exhibited therein is not within its purview. Nevertheless, PimEyes exerts every effort to cull explicit or pornographic content or have it obscured.

SPECIFIC NOTICES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
----------------------------------------

As a California resident, it is important to note that certain legal guidelines, as well as extra consumer rights, are provided by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). It is essential for individuals to abide by these regulations for the protection of their personal data.

_Please note, that according to the CCPA:_

“Personal data” means data that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household, for example real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers, but also biometric data.

A California resident, who is a natural person is referred to as a "Consumer".

A "Household" is a collective, identified by their residential address, of Consumers who reside together and make use of shared devices or services.

Consumer has the following additional rights regarding the Personal data:

### 1\. Upon a verifiable consumer request :

**a)** A Consumer has the right, to know what Personal Data is being collected by PimEyes. In order to exercise this right, a Consumer must make a verifiable request and, upon successfully verifying the request, PimEyes will provide the Consumer with the relevant data :

• Categories of Personal data PimEyes has collected about that Consumer,

• Categories of sources from which the Personal data is collected,

• Business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing Personal data,

• Categories of third parties to whom PimEyes discloses Personal data,

• Specific pieces of Personal data PimEyes has collected about that specific Consumer.

_The data supplied by PimEyes will be restricted to the past twelve months._

**b)** Right to access Personal data;

In order to fulfil this obligation, the Consumer should submit a verifiable request and upon successful verification, PimEyes will promptly disclose and provide the Personal data requested, at no charge to the Consumer. The data may be delivered by mail or electronically and if provided electronically, the data shall be in a portable and to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format, that allows the Consumer to transmit this data to another entity, without hindrance.

**c)** Right to request the deletion of Personal data;

To fulfil the right for consumers to delete some or all of their Personal data, after verification of the request, PimEyes will delete the data, with allowances for any exceptions that result from the California Consumer Privacy Act. If an exception applies, FRA informs you about it in writing.

According to CCPA “Verifiable Consumer Request” is a request, that is made by a Consumer, by a Consumer on behalf of the Consumer’s minor child, by a natural person or a person registered with the Secretary of State. Authorised by the Consumer, to act on the Consumer’s behalf, or by a person who has power of attorney or is acting as a conservator for the Consumer, and that PimEyes can verify, using commercially reasonable methods.

PimEyes shall provide the necessary data to a Consumer without any cost within 45 days of effectively receiving a Verifiable Consumer Request. On legitimate grounds, an extension of 45 more days can be allowed with the Consumer being duly notified of the delay during the initial 45-day period. When there is a need to address the complexity and quantity of the requests, the duration to respond to any Verified Consumer Request could potentially be extended by a further 90 days. PimEyes will advise the Consumer of such an expansion and the reasons for such a postponement within 45 days of receipt of the request, all in a professional manner.

**Verifiable Consumer Request :**

* To ensure accurate identification of the Consumer, it is necessary to collect the Consumer's e-mail address, a face photo, and in the event a request is submitted to access their data, a copy of the Consumer's identity document with the appropriate photo.
    
* If you are representing a Consumer, it is in your best interest to provide PimEyes with appropriate documentation verifying your authority to act on behalf of the Consumer. PimEyes has the right to request authorisation from the Consumer before proceeding.
    
* If you act as a household, PimEyes will require all Consumers constituting the household to submit the request.
    

Verifiable Consumer Request can be made by sending an email containing, respectively, all necessary elements described above to the following email address: [\[email protected\]](https://pimeyes.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### 2\. Right to opt-out the sale of Personal data.

CCPA provides the Consumers with a right to opt-out the sale of Personal data. PimEyes provides the Users only with the search results, i.e., does not sell and declares that it does not intend to sell Personal data in the future.

![Searching for public information only](https://pimeyes.com/build/assets/searching-for-public-information-only-f56022eb.svg)

### Searching for public information only

We search only the open web and sites that allow crawling their data. That means we do not search social media, private accounts, or look for any information that is available only for registered users.

![Searching, not surveilling](https://pimeyes.com/build/assets/searching-not-surveilling-22d19f50.svg)

### Searching, not surveilling

We are a self-investigative tool that allows people to search for publicly available information about themselves. PimEyes is not intended for the surveillance of others and is not designed for that purpose.
