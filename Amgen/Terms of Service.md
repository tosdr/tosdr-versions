13\. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES (THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The law of the State of Delaware shall govern these Terms, without reference to its choice of law rules. You and Amgen agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.

**CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER: YOU AND AMGEN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, AGGREGATE, MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND THAT EACH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.** If any court or arbitrator determines that this Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and you and Amgen shall be deemed not to have agreed to arbitrate Covered Disputes (as that term is defined below). To the extent any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in Delaware, and the parties agree that the litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

**MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES: YOU AND AMGEN AGREE THAT ALL COVERED DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION IN THE MANNER SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 13 AND THAT YOU AND AMGEN WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW. RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.**

Any controversy or claim arising under or related to the Services, related in any way to your relationship with Amgen with respect to the Services, these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the formation, breach, termination, interpretation, validity, scope, applicability, or enforceability of the Terms and this Arbitration Agreement and/or questions of the arbitrability of any controversy or claim brought by you or Amgen (collectively, “**Covered Disputes**”), whether such Covered Disputes arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, shall be settled by binding arbitration if not resolved through the informal dispute resolution procedure set forth below. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory, in whole or in part, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. Covered Disputes are subject to this Arbitration Agreement whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory. Covered Disputes shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Amgen each may seek to resolve a Covered Dispute in small claims court if and only if it qualifies for resolution in small claims court.

**Rules & Governing Law**: In the event of a Covered Dispute, you and Amgen each agree to send the other party a written notice of the Covered Dispute stating the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice; the facts giving rise to the Covered Dispute; and the relief requested (“Notice of Dispute”). You must send any Notice of Dispute by mail to One Amgen Center Drive, Attn: Legal Department, Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320-1799. We will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address we have for you, if any. You and Amgen agree to attempt to resolve in good faith the Covered Dispute through informal negotiation within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is received. After the end of that 30-day period and not before, you or Amgen may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Amgen’s and your right to bring an individual action in small claims court shall not require an attempt to first resolve the Covered Dispute through informal negotiation.

If the parties cannot resolve the Covered Dispute informally, you and Amgen each agree that the Covered Dispute shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding individual arbitration, rather than in court. All Covered Disputes shall be submitted to ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) for arbitration in the county in which you reside, by remote means, or another mutually agreeable location, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration will be administered by ADR Services in accordance with its rules and procedures, including any supplementary rules and fee schedules then in effect (the “Rules”), except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. ADR Services’ Rules are available at https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/. For information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding, you can contact ADR Services at www.adrservices.com. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Amgen may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Delaware, necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or Amgen pending the completion of arbitration.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in these Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that the Terms and this Arbitration Agreement evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and any proceedings under it. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and the Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and the Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of Delaware.

A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the Rules. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on ADR Services’ website at www.adrservices.com. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by ADR Services’ Rules.

If 20 or more similar arbitration demands presented by or with the assistance, coordination, or cooperation of the same law firm, group of law firms, cooperating law firms, or organization are allowed to be submitted for arbitration, ADR Services shall: (i) administer the arbitration demands in 20 batches, with the discretion to create additional batches if ADR Services finds that they are necessary to facilitate the efficient resolution of demands; and (ii) apply a single initial filing fee and administrative fee per batch for each as determined by ADR Services’ applicable fee schedules. You agree to cooperate in good faith to implement this batch approach to facilitate the efficient resolution of claims. This provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing class or mass arbitrations of any kind. Amgen reserves all rights and defenses as to each and any demand and claimant. If any court or arbitrator determines that this subsection is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a mass arbitration basis, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and you and Amgen shall be deemed not to have agreed to arbitrate Covered Disputes.

A single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with ADR Services’ Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties. The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. The arbitrator's decision must be with written explanation sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based, and must remain confidential.

If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 13, or a portion thereof, is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision or portion will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred.

**Opt-Out Procedures**: You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by sending Amgen a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) by mail within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms to One Amgen Center Drive, Attn: Legal Department, Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320-1799. The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days following the date you first agree to these Terms. To be effective, the Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address, and signature. If you opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Amgen.

If any Covered Dispute is determined not to be subject to arbitration, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings concerning such Covered Dispute shall be the federal and state courts of competent jurisdiction in Delaware.

**Changes to Arbitration Agreement**: Amgen may change this Arbitration Agreement, or the policies referred to herein, at its discretion. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 13, if Amgen changes any of the terms of the Arbitration Agreement after the date you first accepted the Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Arbitration Agreement), you may reject any such change by sending Amgen a written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the Effective Date above. This written notice must be provided by mail to One Amgen Center Drive, Attn: Legal Department, Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320-1799. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name, address, and signature, and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate Covered Disputes between you and Amgen in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Arbitration Agreement (or to any subsequent changes to the Arbitration Agreement).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

La ley del Estado de Delaware regirá estos Términos, sin referencia a sus normas de elección de ley. Usted y Amgen aceptan que la Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre Contratos de Compraventa Internacional de Mercaderías no se aplica a la interpretación o construcción de estos Términos.

**RENUNCIA A DEMANDA COLECTIVA/ JUICIO POR JURADO:** **USTED Y AMGEN ACEPTAN QUE CADA UNO PUEDE PRESENTAR RECLAMACIONES CONTRA EL OTRO SÓLO DE FORMA INDIVIDUAL Y NO COMO DEMANDANTE O MIEMBRO DE LA CLASE EN CUALQUIER SUPUESTA ACCIÓN O PROCEDIMIENTO COLECTIVO, AGREGADO, MASIVO, COLECTIVO O REPRESENTATIVO, Y QUE CADA UNO ESTÁ RENUNCIANDO AL DERECHO A UN JUICIO POR JURADO.** Si cualquier tribunal o árbitro determina que esta Demanda colectiva/Renuncia a juicio con jurado es nula o inaplicable por cualquier motivo o que un arbitraje puede proceder de forma colectiva, entonces el Acuerdo de arbitraje se considerará nulo y sin efecto en su totalidad, y usted y Amgen considerarán que no ha aceptado arbitrar Disputas cubiertas (según se define ese término a continuación). En la medida en que se permita que cualquier reclamo proceda de forma colectiva, consolidada o representativa, dichos reclamos deben litigarse en un tribunal federal o estatal de jurisdicción competente en Delaware, y las partes acuerdan que el litigio de esos reclamos será permaneció pendiente del resultado de cualquier reclamo individual en el arbitraje.

**ARBITRAJE VINCULANTE OBLIGATORIO DE DISPUTAS:** **USTED Y AMGEN ACEPTAN QUE TODAS LAS DISPUTAS CUBIERTAS SE RESOLVERÁN MEDIANTE ARBITRAJE INDIVIDUAL VINCULANTE DE LA MANERA ESPECIFICADA EN ESTA SECCIÓN 13 Y QUE USTED Y AMGEN RENUNCIAN A CUALQUIER DERECHO DE PRESENTAR TALES RECLAMACIONES ANTE CUALQUIER TRIBUNAL.

El árbitro también será responsable de determinar todas las cuestiones de umbral de arbitrariedad, incluidas las cuestiones relacionadas con si estos Términos son desmesurados o ilusorios, en su totalidad o en parte, y cualquier defensa al arbitraje, incluida la renuncia, la demora, prescripciones negativas o el impedimento. Las Disputas Cubiertas están sujetas a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje, ya sea que se basen en un contrato, estatuto, regulación, ordenanza, agravio (incluido, entre otros, fraude, tergiversación, incentivo fraudulento, negligencia, negligencia grave o comportamiento imprudente) o cualquier otro acuerdo legal o teoría equitativa. Las Disputas Cubiertas se arbitrarán de forma individual y no se consolidarán en ningún arbitraje con ningún reclamo o controversia de cualquier otra parte. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, usted o Amgen pueden intentar resolver una Disputa cubierta en un tribunal de reclamos menores si y solo si califica para resolución en un tribunal de reclamos menores.

**Normas y leyes aplicables:** en caso de una Disputa cubierta, usted y Amgen acuerdan enviar a la otra parte un aviso por escrito de la Disputa cubierta indicando el nombre, la dirección y la información de contacto de la parte que notifica; los hechos que dieron origen a la Disputa cubierta; y la compensación solicitada ("Aviso de Disputa"). Debe enviar cualquier Aviso de disputa por correo a One Amgen Center Drive, Attn: Legal Department, Thousand Oaks, CA, 91320-1799. Le enviaremos cualquier Aviso de disputa a la dirección de correo electrónico o dirección postal que tengamos para usted, si corresponde. Usted y Amgen acuerdan intentar resolver de buena fe la Disputa cubierta mediante una negociación informal dentro de los 30 días posteriores a la recepción de la Notificación de disputa. Después de finalizar ese período de 30 días y no antes, usted o Amgen podrán iniciar un procedimiento de arbitraje según lo establecido en este Acuerdo de Arbitraje. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, el derecho de Amgen y el suyo a presentar una acción individual en un tribunal de reclamos menores no requerirá un intento de resolver primero la Disputa cubierta mediante una negociación informal.

Si las partes no pueden resolver la Disputa cubierta de manera informal, usted y Amgen acuerdan que la Disputa cubierta se resolverá exclusivamente mediante un arbitraje individual final y vinculante, en lugar de en los tribunales. Todas las disputas cubiertas se presentarán a ADR Services, Inc. ("ADR Services") para su arbitraje en el condado en el que usted reside, por medios remotos u otro lugar mutuamente acordado, y cualquier tribunal podrá dictar sentencia sobre el laudo arbitral. de jurisdicción competente. El arbitraje será administrado por ADR Services de acuerdo con sus reglas y procedimientos, incluidas las reglas complementarias y los programas de tarifas vigentes en ese momento (las "Reglas"), excepto lo modificado por este Acuerdo de Arbitraje. Las Reglas de los Servicios ADR están disponibles en https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/. Para obtener información sobre cómo iniciar un procedimiento de arbitraje, puede comunicarse con ADR Services en www.adrservices.com. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, usted o Amgen pueden solicitar cualquier reparación provisional o preliminar ante un tribunal de jurisdicción competente en Delaware, necesaria para proteger sus derechos de propiedad intelectual o los de Amgen en espera de la finalización del arbitraje.

Sin perjuicio de cualquier elección de ley u otra disposición en estos Términos, las partes acuerdan y reconocen que los Términos y este Acuerdo de Arbitraje evidencian una transacción que involucra comercio interestatal y que la Ley Federal de Arbitraje, 9 USC § 1 et seq. ("FAA"), regirá su interpretación y aplicación y cualquier procedimiento en virtud del mismo. Es la intención de las partes que la FAA y las Reglas prevalezcan sobre todas las leyes estatales en la máxima medida permitida por la ley. Si se determina que la FAA y las Reglas no se aplican a cualquier cuestión que surja en virtud de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje, esa cuestión se resolverá conforme a las leyes de Delaware.

Una parte que desee iniciar un arbitraje debe proporcionar a la otra parte una solicitud de arbitraje por escrito según lo especificado en las reglas. Un formulario para iniciar un procedimiento de arbitraje está disponible en el sitio web de ADR Services en www.adrservices.com. El pago de todos los honorarios de presentación, administración y árbitro se regirá por las Reglas de Servicios ADR.

Si se permite presentar para arbitraje 20 o más demandas de arbitraje similares presentadas por o con la asistencia, coordinación o cooperación del mismo bufete de abogados, grupo de bufetes de abogados, bufetes de abogados cooperantes u organización, los Servicios ADR deberán: (i) administrar las demandas de arbitraje en 20 lotes, con la discreción de crear lotes adicionales si ADR Services considera que son necesarios para facilitar la resolución eficiente de las demandas; y (ii) aplicar una única tarifa de presentación inicial y una tarifa administrativa por lote para cada uno, según lo determinen las listas de tarifas aplicables de ADR Services. Usted acepta cooperar de buena fe para implementar este enfoque por lotes para facilitar la resolución eficiente de reclamos. Esta disposición de ninguna manera se interpretará como que autoriza arbitrajes colectivos o masivos de ningún tipo. Amgen se reserva todos los derechos y defensas respecto de todas y cada una de las demandas y reclamantes. Si cualquier tribunal o árbitro determina que esta subsección es nula o inaplicable por cualquier motivo o que un arbitraje puede proceder sobre la base de un arbitraje masivo, entonces el Acuerdo de Arbitraje se considerará nulo y sin efecto en su totalidad, y usted y Amgen se considerarán no haber aceptado arbitrar Disputas Cubiertas.

Se seleccionará un único árbitro de acuerdo con las Reglas de Servicios ADR. El arbitraje se llevará a cabo en el idioma inglés. El árbitro tendrá el poder de otorgar cualquier compensación que esté disponible en el tribunal conforme a la ley o en equidad y cualquier laudo del árbitro será definitivo y vinculante para cada una de las partes. El árbitro no tendrá, sin embargo, la facultad de otorgar daños punitivos o ejemplares, derecho al que cada parte renuncia por el presente.
