* (a) General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and BioTRUST in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and BioTRUST agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these messaging terms and conditions ("Messaging Terms") or your receipt of text messages from BioTRUST or its service providers will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Messaging Terms, or your receipt of text messages from BioTRUST or its service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE MESSAGING TERMS, YOU AND BioTRUST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THESE MESSAGING TERMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.
* (b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, nothing in these Messaging Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or BioTRUST to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
* (c) Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and BioTRUST will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Messaging Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/ "http://www.adr.org"), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting BioTRUST. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
* (d) Notice; Process. If you or BioTRUST intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail ("Notice"). BioTRUST address for Notice is: 500 Corporate Circle, Suite G, Golden, Colorado 80401, Attn: Chief Executive Officer. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and BioTRUST will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and BioTRUST do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or BioTRUST may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or BioTRUST must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
* (e) Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Messaging Terms, BioTRUST will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse BioTRUST for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and BioTRUST agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from you or BioTRUST made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
* (f) No Class Actions. YOU AND BioTRUST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and BioTRUST agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
* (g) Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Messaging Terms, if BioTRUST makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to BioTRUST address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to BioTRUST address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and BioTRUST.
* (h) Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations of subsection (f) above (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of these Messaging Terms is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of these Messaging Terms shall remain in full force and effect.

We reserve the right to terminate or change our messaging program at any time. We also reserve the right to change these Messaging Terms at any time and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued enrollment following such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.  
  

**Subscribe & Save Program**

BioTRUST is pleased to offer a Subscribe & Save Program for its Products. When you choose to enroll in our Subscribe & Save Program by selecting the Subscribe & Save option when placing an order for any Product (a “Subscription Order”), the following Terms apply. By placing a Subscription Order, you acknowledge and accept these terms, conditions, limitations, and requirements. Please read these Terms carefully.

**Subscription Account**

You must have a registered account with BioTRUST, a valid email address, and a credit card and/or debit card to participate in the Subscribe & Save Program.

**Subscription Order Automatic Renewal**

Our Subscribe & Save Program is an automatic, recurring subscription that begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will automatically renew (i.e., BioTRUST will automatically process your Subscription Order for shipment) and you will continue to be charged on a recurring basis according to the delivery frequency (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 weeks) you select at checkout until you cancel.

BY ENROLLING IN OUR SUBSCRIBE & SAVE PROGRAM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION HAS AN INITIAL AND RECURRING PAYMENT FEATURE AND YOU ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL RECURRING CHARGES FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME, UNTIL DEACTIVATED BY YOU OR US, ON THE TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN.

**Subscription Order Payment**

Your Subscription order's final total may vary due to changes in price, tax rates, and/or shipping costs. Your order total will include:

* Sales tax, if applicable
* Shipping and handling costs, if applicable
* Please note that certain coupon codes may only be applied to your first subscription order. We do not accept coupon codes for subsequent orders.

The purchase price for the Product included in your first Subscription order and all subsequent renewal orders will be discounted by 40% (before tax, shipping and other costs, if applicable).

**Subscription Order Placement**

The total cost charged to your payment method for each Subscription Order will be the total price of the item(s) in your Subscription Order on the date that order is processed less the applicable Subscribe & Save discount (described below), plus any applicable taxes and shipping (as applicable).

Subscribe & Save Discount – The total price of the Product(s) included in your first Subscription Order and all subsequent renewal orders will be discounted by 40% (before tax, shipping and other costs, as applicable). 

Credit card and debit card payment are the only valid payment methods accepted for Subscription Order payment under our Subscribe & Save Program. Store credit, gift certificates, checks, and Cash On Delivery or Bill Me Later will not be accepted.

The charge for each Subscription Order will automatically be billed to the primary payment method used to place your initial Subscription Order or as otherwise provided by you. You authorize BioTRUST or its third-party payment processing provider to store your payment method and to automatically charge your payment method on a recurring basis according to the delivery frequency you select (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 weeks) until you cancel. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BioTRUST WILL NOT OBTAIN ANY ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU FOR SUCH AUTOMATIC, RECURRING PAYMENTS. If your payment method fails, your order will not be placed; you will be notified that your Subscription Order payment has failed and you will need to update your payment information. Once your payment information is updated, your Subscription Order will be processed. If you fail to update your payment method and provide payment, we will suspend your subscription. To edit or update your payment information, you can login to your account, go to your Account Dashboard, click on “Manage Subscriptions," and then click on “Billing” to update the payment method on file.

The Products available for the Subscribe & Save Program are based on a current price. We may change the price of a Product in your Subscription Order at any time, and we will notify you of any price increase with the option to cancel. If you do not agree with a price increase, you have the right to reject the increase by canceling your Subscription Order prior to the next auto-shipment date as described in the “Cancellation of Subscription” section below.

**Subscription Order Notifications**

A confirmation email will be sent to you after each Subscription Order is processed and shipped. You also will be notified via email (if opted-in) three (3) calendar days prior to the next auto-shipment date of upcoming charges for any subsequent Subscription Order. You will again be notified when payment for the subsequent Subscription Order has been processed.

**Subscription Order Processing Times**

If your Subscription Order auto-shipment date falls on a weekend or holiday, or on a date that the following month does not have (example: 31st), your Subscription Order will be processed on the next business day.

**Changing or Modifying Subscription Orders**

Subscribe & Save Program auto-shipments will be of the same Product or Products, at the same frequency and of the same quantity ordered at the time of checkout for your initial Subscription Order. You may change the Product or Products included in your subscription, adjust the quantity of the Product(s) you wish to receive or modify the delivery frequency of your Subscription Orders at any time by logging into your account, going to your Account Dashboard, and clicking "Manage Subscriptions.”

Pricing may change depending on the changes to the Product(s) or quantity of Product(s) included in your Subscription Order.

**Cancellation of Subscription**

YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNTIL YOU CANCEL. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO ANY PRODUCT OR PRODUCTS OFFERED THROUGH THE SUBSCRIBE & SAVE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME BY LOGGING INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AND SELECTING TO CANCEL IN THE “MANAGE SUBSCRIPTIONS” SECTION. YOU MUST CANCEL WITH AT LEAST SEVENTY-TWO (72) HOURS’ NOTICE PRIOR TO THE NEXT AUTO-SHIPMENT DATE TO RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. IF YOU CANCEL AFTER THAT TIME FRAME, YOUR PAYMENT IS NON-REFUNDABLE AND YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CHARGES (INCLUDING APPLICABLE TAXES) INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO ANY ORDER IDENTIFIED AS OUTSTANDING PRIOR TO THE CANCELLATION OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.

To cancel your subscription, you may do so through your online account by logging into your account, going to your Account Dashboard, clicking on “Manage Subscriptions”, then clicking “Cancel” under actions on the desired Product you wish to unsubscribe from.

In the event you cancel your subscription, please note that we may still send you promotional communications about BioTRUST, unless you opt out of receiving those communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided therein.

**Formula Changes for Products in Subscription Orders**

BioTRUST is committed to constantly innovating its Products and from time to time will update a Product’s or Products’ formula. In the event of such an update, your Subscription Order will continue as before except that the Product or Products will be replaced with the new formula Product or Products. You will not be notified separately of this change before a subsequent Subscription Order is processed and shipped. The new formula Product or Products will continue for all subsequent Subscription Orders unless you choose to remove this item from your subscription.
