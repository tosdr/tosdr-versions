Terms and Conditions
====================

Last Updated: November 20, 2017

1. Acceptance of Terms

Threatpost provides our Internet site and the content, products and services offered on or through this site (collectively, the “Services”), to you subject to the following Terms of Service (“TOS”). Your use of the Services in whole or in part constitutes your binding acceptance of these TOS. If you do not agree to these TOS, you should not use the Services. Some Services may be subject to additional posted rules, policies and terms. When you use those Services, you and Threatpost shall be subject to those additional conditions, which are incorporated by reference into these TOS (and, consequently, form part of your agreement with us). Because we may modify all or any part of these TOS from time to time without notice to you, you should check back often so you are aware of your current rights and responsibilities. Your continued use of a given Service after changes to the TOS have been published on that Service constitutes your binding acceptance of the updated TOS. If at any time the TOS are no longer acceptable to you, you should immediately cease all use of the Services.

3. Description of Services

The Services include a combination of content that we create and that other third party content suppliers create. In addition, some Services provide you and other users with an opportunity to submit, post, display, transmit and/or exchange information, ideas, opinions, photographs, images, video, creative works or other information, messages, transmissions or material to us or others on or through that Service (collectively, the “Postings”). We adhere to high journalistic standards, and use every reasonable effort to provide informative and relevant content as part of the Services. However, in using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you find offensive, indecent, objectionable or that is inaccurate and you bear all risks associated with using that content. You understand that the Services are provided by Threatpost “AS IS”, as further described in Section 15 of these TOS, and that Threatpost does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of any content available on or through the Services. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any of this content, whether created by or submitted to Threatpost, including, but not limited to, product reviews, white papers, product descriptions, or Postings on any bulletin board, chat, news group, community, discussion forum or other feedback section of the Services (collectively, the “Forums”). You understand that from time to time, you may communicate with, receive communications from, or otherwise participate in or use the services or obtain goods and services of or from, third parties (e.g., advertisers) as a result of your use of the Services. All such communication, interaction and participation is strictly and solely between you and such third party and Threatpost shall not be responsible or liable to you in any way in connection with these activities or transactions (including, but not limited to, any representations, warranties, covenants, contracts or other terms or conditions that may exist between you and the third party, or any goods or services you may purchase or obtain from any third party). In particular, the appearance or availability of links to third party sites on or through the Services does not constitute an endorsement by Threatpost with respect to the content, advertising, products, or other materials available on or from such sites. You further understand and agree that the Services may include certain communications from Threatpost(such as administrative messages and certain newsletters), and that these communications are considered part of the Service and you may not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Services shall be subject to the TOS. Finally, you are responsible for obtaining access to the Services and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Services.

5. General Rules of Conduct

Your use of the Services is subject to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations, and you agree not to violate such laws and regulations. In addition, you agree that:

7. * you will not interfere with another member’s use and enjoyment of the Services; you will not interfere with or disrupt the security measures of the Services; you will not interfere with or disrupt networks connected to the Services, and will comply with all regulations, policies and procedures of such networks; and
    * you will comply with United States law regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States.

You further agree that you will not use the Services to:

9. * send or result in the transmission of junk e-mail, chain letters, duplicative or unsolicited messages, or so-called “spamming”; harm minors in any way; promote or generate revenue for any business or commercial purposes, whether or not for a charge or through linking with any other web services or pages, unless authorized by Threatpost; impersonate any person or entity; intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international law; “stalk” or otherwise harass another; or
    * collect or store personal data about other users.
10. Postings

Although we reserve the right to edit Postings prior to their inclusion on the Services, as a general matter Threatpost does not screen or monitor such content. Therefore, you understand that you are solely responsible for all Postings and other materials, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, that are uploaded, posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available from your email address on our through the Services. You further agree that your Postings will not violate these TOS. Specifically, you represent and warrant that your Postings will not contain any material that:

12. * is false, inaccurate, or misleading; infringes any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; violates a nondisclosure agreement, or violates any law or regulation (including, without limitation, those governing export control, unfair competition, or false advertising); is defamatory, constitutes trade libel or product disparagement, or is unlawfully threatening or harassing; is obscene or contains child pornography; or
    * contains viruses, Trojan horses, time bombs, worms, cancelbots, easter eggs or other computer programming routines that may damage or interfere with the operation of any system, or unlawfully intercept any data or personal information.

You also agree that you will not:

14. * reproduce, distribute, republish or retransmit material posted by any other Services users without the permission of that user and Threatpost; take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; or
    * interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services, any activities conducted on or through the Services, or any networks through which you access the Services.

You further represent and warrant that:

16. * your Postings will be original and/or you will obtain all third-party permission necessary for the use of the Postings as set forth below; you are the sole and exclusive owner of all rights herein conveyed to Threatpost and its affiliates and partners ; and
    * you have the full and restricted power to convey such rights to Threatpost and its affiliates and partners free and clear of the claims of any other person or entity.

In sum, Postings do not reflect the views of Threatpost and Threatpost does not verify, endorse, of vouch for any such content. We do, however, enforce these TOS, and if we determine in our sole discretion that any Posting is inaccurate, was posted without authorization, or otherwise does or may violate these TOS, we reserve the right, at any time, without prior notice and without limiting any and all other rights we may have, at law or in equity, to (a) modify, refuse or remove the Posting; (b) revoke the applicable user’s right to use the Services; and/or (d) use any technological, legal, operational or other means available to Threatpost to enforce the provisions of these TOS, including, without limitation, blocking specific IP addresses or deactivating the applicable user’s registration.

Finally, you specifically grant to Threatpost and its affiliates, partners and service providers (or warrant that the owner of such content grants to Threatpost and its affiliates, partners and service providers) a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, nonexclusive right and license, sublicensable through multiple tiers, to:

19. * use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display all Postings submitted by you or through your account, in whole or in part; use, in whole or in part, your name, likeness, photograph, voice, company name, screen name, e-mail address and/or other identifying information submitted by you as part of or in connection with such Postings (“Image”), and reproduce, publish, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display materials containing the same; and
    * incorporate the Postings and the Image in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe, and reproduce, publish, display and otherwise distribute the same.

For sake of clarity, by virtue of the above grant, you also give Threatpost and its affiliates and partners permission to copy your Postings and the Image as part of the normal backup process and/or to archive discussions containing your Postings and/or the Image.

21. Threatpost’s Proprietary Rights

All Services software, design, text, images, photographs, illustrations, audio and video material, artwork, graphic material, database, proprietary information and all copyrightable or otherwise legally protectible elements of the Services, including, but not limited to, the selection, sequence and ‘look and feel’ and arrangement of items, and all trademarks, service marks and trade names, excluding any of your Postings (individually and/or collectively, “Material”), are the property of Threatpost, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors or suppliers and are legally protected, without limitation, under U.S. Federal and State, as well as applicable foreign, laws, regulations and treaties. The compilation of all content on each site is the exclusive property of Threatpost. You may not reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, display, perform, publish, distribute, disseminate, broadcast or circulate to any third party (including, without limitation, on or via a third party web site), or otherwise use, any materials contained on the Services (except for your Postings) without the express prior written consent of Threatpost or its owner if Threatpost is not the owner. In particular, you may not frame any Material without the express prior written consent of Threatpost or the Material owner. You must not alter, delete or conceal any copyright or other notices contained on the Services, including notices on any Material you download, transmit, print or reproduce from the Services. Any unauthorized or prohibited use of any Material, may subject you to civil liability or criminal prosecution, or both, under applicable federal and state laws. You further agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Threatpost for use in accessing the Service.

23. Discussion Forums

Some of our Services give users the opportunity to participate in Forums operated by Threatpost or by a third party. We ask that our users exercise appropriate caution when participating in any type of Forum. In particular, please remember that if you publicly disclose personal identifying information, such as your name or email address, in connection with a Forum, the information may be collected and used by others. You should also take reasonable precautions with regard to any material you download from or through Forums (for example, scanning for viruses or other damaging computer programming routines). Finally, you agree to use the Forums only to send and receive messages and material that are proper and related to that particular Forum.

25. Directories and Other Membership Listings

Some of our Services allow users to make some of their personal information (including, but not limited to, name, company affiliation and job title) available to other visitors as part of a membership directory or other listing for that Service. Please remember: If you do not want certain information to be available to other Service users, you should not include it in any membership directory listing. As with all other content on the Services, we reserve the right to refuse (or remove) listings in our sole discretion, and without prior notice, if we determine that they are inaccurate, were posted without authorization, or otherwise violate these TOS.

27. Promotions

Some of our Services may from time to time conduct promotions, including, but not limited to, auctions, contests and sweepstakes (“Promotions”). Each Promotion will have additional terms, conditions and rules which will be posted or otherwise made available to you and, for purposes of each Promotion in which you participate, will be deemed incorporated by reference into these TOS (and therefore a part of your agreement with Threatpost).

29. Fee-Based Services

Some of our Services require that you to pay a fee to access or use such Service, as described in the specific conditions included where those Services are offered. You agree to pay all fees and charges that you incur. Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in U.S. dollars. We may, upon notice if required by applicable laws, at any time change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fee or charge, or institute new fees or charges. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable.

31. Registrations Obligations

Some of our Services require that you register with that Service in order to access or use it. If such registration is required, you agree that you will provide accurate information (such as your real name and a valid e-mail address) and will update your relevant information if it becomes outdated. If you provide any information that is, or that Threatpost in its reasonable discretion determines may be, untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Threatpost has the right, without prior notice, to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof). For more detailed information about how we treat the registration information you provide to us, please see our Privacy Statement, which is incorporated by reference into these TOS (and therefore a part of your agreement with us).

33. Passwords and Other Security Issues

If we issue you a password, you agree to help protect your information by guarding that password, and by changing it as soon as possible if you believe its security has been compromised. If Threatpost allows you to choose a username and you select, in Threatpost’s sole discretion, one that is obscene, indecent, abusive or which is otherwise objectionable, Threatpost has the right, without prior notice to you, to automatically change your username, delete your Postings under it, deny you access to the Services, or any combination of these options. You may not transfer your registration, password or user name to another person or share it with anyone. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage that may result if you fail to comply with these requirements. If you believe your information has been used without your authorization, you agree to notify Threatpost immediately.

35. Privacy Policy

Threatpost respects your privacy. Please see our Privacy Statement for important information and disclosures relating to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information in connection with your use of the Services.

37. Service Deactivation or Termination

39. * Restrict, suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of our Services;
    * Refuse, move or remove for any reason any material that you submit on or through the Services;

41. Indemnification

Threatpost reserves the right to assume, at its sole expense, the exclusive defense and control of any claim, action or other matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and all negotiations for settlement or compromise thereof, and you agree to fully cooperate with Threatpost in the defense of any such claim, action, settlement or compromise negotiations, as requested by Threatpost.

44. Disclaimers of Warranties

THE SERVICES, AND MATERIALS, PRODUCTS AND POSTINGS ARE MADE AVAILABLE ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, PROMISE OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ANY GUARANTY OR ASSURANCE THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR USE, OR UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL PRODUCTS, FEATURES, FUNCTIONS OR OPERATIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE OR PERFORM AS DESCRIBED OR THAT ANY ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. IN ADDITION, ANY MATERIAL THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN THROUGH OUR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY POTENTIAL DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL. Without limiting the foregoing, Threatpost is not responsible or liable for any malicious code, delays, inaccuracies, errors, or omissions arising out of your use of the Services.

Under no circumstances shall any Threatpost Party be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on information obtained through the Services. It is your responsibility to evaluate the information, opinion, advice, or other content available through the Services.

46. Limitation of Liability

BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY TO ANY MERCHANDISE, SERVICES, AND CONTENT THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE THROUGH SUCH SERVICES.

Notwithstanding any claim that a sole or exclusive remedy which is provided in this agreement may or does fail of its essential purpose, you specifically acknowledge and agree that your sole and exclusive remedy for any loss or damage shall be to have Threatpost, upon written notice from you to us, attempt to repair, correct or replace any deficient Service and, if repair, correction or replacement is not reasonably commercially practicable for Threatpost, in its sole discretion, to refund any monies actually paid by you for the Service involved and to terminate and discontinue your use of the Services.

Entire Agreement. These TOS, including the policies referred to in these TOS, constitute the entire agreement between you and Threatpost and govern your use of the Services, superceding any prior agreements between you and Threatpost.
