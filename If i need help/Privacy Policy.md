**7\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

7.1 As used in these Terms of Use, the term “Dispute” means any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Site, these Terms of Use, or your purchase or use of any If I Need Help product or related service, including without limitation, the interpretation, performance, formation, validity, breach (including, without limitation, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties) or enforcement of these Terms of Use, and further including any such controversy, claim, or dispute against or involving any officer, director, agent, employee, affiliate, successor, predecessor or assign of a party to these Terms of Use.

7.2 Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Use, any Dispute shall be resolved according to the procedures set forth in this Section 7, which shall constitute the sole and exclusive dispute resolution mechanism to resolve all Disputes, and no other procedure may be used, with the sole exception that a party to a Dispute need not comply with all requirements of this Section 7 before filing a claim for equitable relief. Each party's promise to resolve all Disputes as set forth herein is given in consideration for the other party's like promise. With regard to any Disputes between If I Need Help and you, you agree to work together with If I Need Help in good faith to resolve all Disputes promptly.

7.3 Either party may demand, in writing, that each party’s management representatives meet within fourteen (14) days at such place or in such a manner as If I Need Help may designate to resolve the Dispute. No third party shall have authority to consider or resolve any Dispute that is not first the subject of informal dispute resolution pursuant to this Section 7.3. The parties or their representatives with full authority to settle the Disputes at issue shall attend all meetings.

7.4 If the parties do not resolve a Dispute within fourteen (14) days of the date of the first meeting between management representatives (the “Informal Dispute Resolution Deadline”), you agree to mediate the Dispute within fourteen (14) days of the Informal Dispute Resolution Deadline and at such place as If I Need Help may designate with a mutually agreed upon mediator. If the parties cannot agree upon the selection of a mediator, the mediator will be chosen from the list of certified mediators maintained by a court having jurisdiction over the Dispute. The parties agree to continue to work in good faith to resolve the Dispute prior to the date upon which the mediation is scheduled to take place. If the parties agree on a resolution for the Dispute prior to the scheduled mediation date, the mediation shall be cancelled. The parties agree to share equally the costs of any independent mediator engaged to assist the parties in resolving their Dispute. If you fail to mediate the Dispute within fourteen (14) days of the Informal Dispute Resolution Deadline, you shall be deemed to have waived your right to demand mediation and If I Need Help may, in its sole discretion, proceed directly to litigation or arbitration (as applicable).

7.5 In the event the Dispute is not resolved through mediation, either party may institute litigation to resolve the issues. If litigation is initiated, the parties to this Agreement agree that venue and jurisdiction of any litigation between them will be vested solely in a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in Los Angeles, California, and agree to accept service of process outside of the State of California. The parties expressly agree to waive trial by jury in any such legal proceeding.

7.6 Arbitration.

(a) If the parties are unable to resolve one or more Dispute(s) by mediation, then the Dispute shall be fully and finally adjudicated by binding arbitration to the fullest extent allowed by law, but only if the arbitration is properly commenced within the time allowed for similar legal action to be commenced in accordance with the applicable statute of limitations; otherwise, the Dispute is waived. Except as provided herein or by agreement of both parties hereto, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS or its successor (“JAMS”) and shall be conducted according to the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “Rules”) or, if JAMS is no longer in existence, then the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (“AAA”) and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time. The arbitration shall be conducted as expeditiously and economically as reasonably practicable.

(b) The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”). Unless all parties to the arbitration agree, the Arbitrator shall be a lawyer admitted to practice in at least one State of the United States and need not be on the roster of JAMS or the AAA. The Arbitrator shall be selected as follows: If all parties to the Dispute do not agree upon the Arbitrator within twenty (20) days after commencement of the arbitration, then any party may initiate the following selection process by written notice to the other party. Within five (5) business days after such notice, each side to the Dispute shall simultaneously transmit to each other side a list of four (4) persons qualified to serve as the Arbitrator (the “Candidates”). No party shall nominate a Candidate whom that party knows or reasonably believes to have a conflict of interest rendering the Candidate unable to serve as the Arbitrator. If any single Candidate appears on the list of each side, then that person shall be appointed as the Arbitrator. If more than one Candidate appears on the list of each side, then one of those Candidates shall be selected randomly and that person shall be appointed as the Arbitrator. If no Candidate appears on the list of each side then, within three (3) business days after the initial exchange of lists, each side may strike one Candidate from the list of each other side and rank all remaining Candidates in order of preference (with “1” being the most preferable Candidate), and the ranked lists shall be simultaneously exchanged. The Candidate with the lowest total number of points shall be appointed as the Arbitrator. In the event of a tie, one of the Candidates with the lowest total number of points shall be selected randomly and that person shall be appointed as the Arbitrator. If the person selected as the Arbitrator declines to serve or becomes unwilling or unable to serve after selection or appointment, or the administrator declines to appoint that person as the Arbitrator, then the Candidate with the next lowest total of points shall be appointed as the Arbitrator. If any party to the arbitration fails to timely participate in the foregoing selection process then the administrator shall select and appoint the Arbitrator pursuant to the Rules, except that each recalcitrant party shall be excluded from that selection process.

(c) The Arbitrator shall entertain any demurrer, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with California or United States federal rules of procedure, as applicable.

(d) The exchange of information in the arbitration shall be governed by the Rules except as follows: (i) no side shall take the deposition of more than three (3) individuals (including the use of corporate, “persons most knowledgeable,” F.R.C.P. 30(b)(6), or similar deposition notices or devices) unless, upon a showing of extraordinary cause, the Arbitrator permits that side to take a limited number of additional depositions; (ii) each side shall be entitled to the limited discovery of documents (including electronically stored information) which are directly relevant and material to the Dispute and are produced in response to a request that is narrowly tailored to minimize both the burden and expense of the responding person and the disclosure of confidential, sensitive or financial information; (iii) no party shall propound interrogatories or requests for admission unless permitted by the Arbitrator upon a showing of extraordinary cause; and (iv) upon the request of any party, the Arbitrator shall weigh the anticipated burden or expense of any requested discovery against its likely benefit, and shall impose any reasonable conditions on that discovery, including, without limitation, allocation of the expense of the discovery to the party seeking it.

(e) The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the Dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (the “Award”). The Award shall be final and binding on the parties and, if the Award is not fully satisfied within ten (10) business days after its issuance, then judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets. You hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California for any purpose permitted herein.

(f) The administrative costs of the arbitration, including fees of the Arbitrator, initially shall be split equally between the sides; provided, however, that the Arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, allocate such costs in favor of any prevailing party.

(g) If all or any portion of a Dispute is held to be non-arbitrable then that Dispute (or portion thereof) shall be adjudicated by a single referee appointed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 638 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure by a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement including, without limitation, any other provision of this Section 7, If I Need Help or you may bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any actual or threatened infringement of any intellectual property rights or any actual or threatened violation of any confidentiality provisions in these Terms of Use.

7.8 Any notices being sent under this Section 7 must be sent via email to support@ifineedhelp.org. All notices to you will be sent via email to the email set out in your account.
