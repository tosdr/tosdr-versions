In addition, if you are an Employer and you view the profile of certain Candidates, those Candidates may be able to see that you have viewed their profiles.

If you are a Registered User, your Princess Dental Staffing online status may be made available to other Registered Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential.

In addition, if you provide information about someone other than yourself, you represent that you have authority to provide us the information and to authorize us to share the information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Candidate may share information about who is receiving their services, including contact information, with Princess Dental Staffing and any subsidiaries.

We have implemented Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA technology on our site. Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/).

### D. With listings in and through Google and other public search engines, social media sites (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Google), and on other third party websites)

In an effort to further facilitate the ability of Employers or Candidates to find help or a job, selected information contained in Employer job postings and Candidate profiles, which may include photo, first name, first initial of last name, city, state, and job/provider description, may also be shared with third party search engines, social media sites, and other third party websites or vendors who run classified advertising and other businesses, and thus may be listed in third party web site search results and on third party websites, which would make that information available to the public and allow them to link to your Princess Dental Staffing posting. Registered Users can opt-out of some options by adjusting their Account Settings. If you post information in a Princess Dental Staffing online group forum, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in third party search engine results and available to the public.

This may involve the sharing of your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations.

Princess Dental Staffing may offer various background check services from consumer reporting agencies. A Candidate can authorize a Motor Vehicle Records Check, Criminal Records Check, Criminal+ MVR Check, or an Investigative Criminal Plus check in response to a request by an Employer who is considering hiring him or her. If you authorize a background check to be run on you in response to a request by an Employer who is considering hiring you, the results of the check will be shared directly with the Employer. If you are a Registered User who has requested a background check through Princess Dental Staffing, a statement may be included in your profile to confirm that you have completed that check. The service provider who completes the background check may also send the results to you by email or postal mail. **You acknowledge that sensitive material may be included in your background check, and that you are responsible for providing us and our service provider (if applicable) with correct information.**

Through certain pages of the Site, Princess Dental Staffing may from time to time offer to individuals who may or may not be Registered Users the opportunity to purchase Investigative Criminal or Investigative Criminal Plus background checks on caregivers who may or may not be Registered Users. If you authorize an Investigative Criminal or Investigative Criminal Plus Check to be run on you in response to such a request, the results of the check will be shared directly with the requester. If you are a Registered User of the Site and have requested such a background check, a statement may be included in your profile to confirm that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the check or results with any other Site Visitor or Registered User unless you specifically consent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can update certain of your information by logging into your account and accessing your account settings. If you would like to remove some of the information you have posted on the Site, such as information you posted in profiles and job postings, you may do so by editing or deleting that item in your My Profile & Settings area or your My Jobs area.

If you no longer wish to participate in our Services, you may inactivate your account directly through your account settings.

If you inactivate your Princess Dental Staffing account, we will remove your name and other contact and identifiable information from our publicly viewable database. If you inactivate your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain information related to you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, de-identified information, account recovery, auditing our records, enforcing our rights and obligations under our agreements, or if required by law. Princess Dental Staffing may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Registered Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails you send through Princess Dental Staffing to other Users, as well as your contributions to Princess Dental Staffing groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that others have copied, may also remain visible. Princess Dental Staffing disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information, or any obligation not to delete the information. Princess Dental Staffing does not control when search engines update their search index or cache, which may contain certain job posts, profiles or other information that have since been removed from Princess Dental Staffing’s Site.

VII. Your Data Protection Rights
--------------------------------

You have numerous rights in connection with your personal information and how we handle it, i.e to access, correct, update or request deletion, object the processing, restrict processing, request portability, withdraw your consent and right to file a complaint.

Your rights:

* To access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information. You may do so by contacting us at [info@princessdentalstaffing.com](mailto:info@princessdentalstaffing.com).
* To object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. You may do so by contacting us [info@princessdentalstaffing.com](mailto:info@princessdentalstaffing.com).
* If we are processing your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted pursuant to lawful processing grounds other than consent. You may do so by contacting us at [info@princessdentalstaffing.com](mailto:info@princessdentalstaffing.com).
* You have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
* You can control and limit the type of personal information we collect and process about you in a number of ways. For example, you can disconnect your social media account(s) from your account or control your social media privacy settings to limit the information shared with us. You can also reset your mobile advertising identifier or limit ad tracking altogether using the settings on your phone. You can also limit or disable the use of cookies (or similar technologies).

We will respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

VIII. Collection of Information from Children
---------------------------------------------

Princess Dental Staffing’s Site and Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 14. Moreover, if we become aware that we have collected personal information (as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as practicable.

IX. How We Protect Information
------------------------------

We have implemented a variety of administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of information that we collect, process, and store and the current state of technology.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot guarantee that information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

X. Links to Other Websites
--------------------------

The Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites and services. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those web sites or services, nor are we responsible for the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and Services; thus when you use a link to go from the Site or Services to a third-party web site or service, this policy is no longer in effect and the privacy policy of such third-party site or service will govern.

XI. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
---------------------------------

Princess Dental Staffing reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://www.princessdentalstaffing.com/terms) at any time. We will notify you about and provide you with choice about material changes to this Privacy Policy or in our practices as required by applicable law. Material changes will go into effect 30 days after we notify. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately upon posting of the updated policy on our Site. You should periodically check https://www.princessdentalstaffing.com/privacy for updates. Your use of the Site or the Services after such effective date will constitute acceptance by you of such changes.

XII. Privacy Information for California Residents
-------------------------------------------------

If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding how we collect, use, and share your "personal information" (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA")).

**Categories of personal information we collect.**

Throughout this Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about our users. Under the CCPA, we are also required to provide you with the "categories" of personal information we collect as defined by California law. The categories we collect depending on the types of services you use are:

* identifiers (such as name, address, email address);
* commercial information (such as transaction data);
* financial data (such as payment method details and billing address);
* internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or usage information);
* geolocation information (e.g., your approximate location based on IP address, or precise location with your consent);
* inference data about you (e.g., the additional services or advertising we think would be of most interest to you based on your interactions with us);
* professional or employment-related data (e.g., if you are a Candidate, your references and employment history);
* education information (e.g., if you are a Candidate, your level of education);
* legally protected classifications (such as gender or information obtained from a background check, where applicable);
* physical characteristics or description (e.g., photos you choose to upload to your job postings or profile);
* sensory or visual information (e.g. if you provide us this information in connection with senior care planning or child care)
* medical information (e.g. if you provide us this information in connection with COVID-19)
* other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you (e.g., registration and log-in information).

Please note that specific pieces of your personal information may belong to more than one of the above referenced categories.

**How we source, use, and share these categories of personal information.**

We source, use, and share with third parties the categories of personal information we collect from and about you consistent with the various business and operational purposes we discuss throughout this Policy and for the business and operational purposes of our service providers in accordance with the CCPA. See the "Information We Collect And their Sources", "Purposes For Which We Use Information" and "How We Share and Categories of Third Parties with Whom We Share Information" section(s) above for more information.

Please note that the CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that "sell" personal information to third parties. We do not engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months from the effective date of this Policy.

**CCPA Rights Disclosure.**

If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you (or an authorized agent acting on your behalf) to make certain requests related to your personal information. Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:

* Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information. Such information is also set forth in this Policy.
* Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.
* Delete certain personal information we have about you.
* Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.

The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you. We also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request. In doing so, we may use one or more of the following methods: (i) using your login credentials to verify you (it being understood that we may also ask you to reauthenticate yourself), or (ii) matching two or more data points provided by you with data points maintained by us. If we are unable to verify you through the foregoing methods, we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to request additional information from you. If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, or if you are an authorized agent making a request on a user’s behalf, please contact us at [info@princessdentalstaffing.com](mailto:info@princessdentalstaffing.com).

**Shine the Light Disclosure.**

The California "Shine the Light" law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

XIII. Privacy Information for Nevada Residents
----------------------------------------------

Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of "personally identifiable information" for monetary consideration (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. If you are a Nevada resident and you have purchased services or products from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by contacting us via e-mail at [info@princessdentalstaffing.com](mailto:info@princessdentalstaffing.com). Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.
