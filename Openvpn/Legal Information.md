        You may never use any Trademark in a way that implies that you or the products and services you offer are endorsed by, sponsored, or affiliated with OpenVPN, without the prior written consent of OpenVPN.

(the “FAA”) judicial Mediation and Arbitration Service (JAMS) under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as in effect from time to time.  A copy of the current version of these rules is at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration.  The arbitration will be conducted by means of remote video communication and not at a physical location unless the parties otherwise agree.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine an appropriate remedy in connection with any matter brought before the arbitrator including sanctions or interlocutory relief with respect to discovery, provided that such remedy must be of a nature that a court could award if the matter had been litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction.  The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding. Judgment upon the award of the arbitrator, including any interlocutory relief or sanctions granted or issued by the arbitrator with respect to matters related to discovery, may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of that award.
    
    BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE, EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS IRREVOCABLY WAIVING ITS RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY SUCH CLAIMS TRIED IN A COURT BEFORE A JURY.
    
    A party may seek a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, or other interim relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without prior reference to arbitration if such interim relief is necessary to prevent irreparable injury to that party for which monetary damages alone will be insufficient to provide a proper remedy.  After the court has determined whether to grant interim relief, the matter may be submitted to arbitrationbyanypartyforfinalresolution.
    
    If either you or OpenVPN wishes to initiate an arbitration (or lawsuit or other type of proceeding to the extent permitted under these Terms of Use) against the other party based on a controversy or claim that arises out or relates to these Terms of Use, that party must bring that arbitration or other action no later than one year after that controversy or claim arose.  A failure to initiate an arbitration or other proceeding within that one year period will cause that claim or right to submit that controversy to arbitration to be forever waived and barred.
    
    For any dispute arising out of or relating to a Product or Service, the dispute resolution provisions of the applicable Products and Services Agreement will apply to the exclusion of this Section 22.

**EXHIBIT B – SECURITY MEASURES**

The Security Measures applicable to the Service are described here (as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 4.c of this DPA).

_**MFA is required to access stored data. Access is limited based on least privilege and limited to a small number of importer employees who require access. All data transfer is performed over encrypted connections. Only minimum necessary data is collected. Information Security program is overseen by certified individual (CISSP, CISM, GPEN, GXPN.)**_

_**Sub-processors that are certified in PCI-DSS are used to process credit card transactions. Required transaction information is transferred to importer over encrypted connections.**_

**EXHIBIT C - JURISDICTION-SPECIFIC TERMS**

**Europe:  
**Objection to Sub-Processors. Customer may object in writing to OpenVPN’s appointment of a new Sub-Processor within five (5) calendar days of receiving notice in accordance with Section 3.a of the DPA, provided that such objection is based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such event, the parties shall discuss such concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, OpenVPN will, at its sole discretion, either not appoint such Sub-Processor, or permit Customer to suspend or terminate the affected Service in accordance with the termination provisions in the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by Customer prior to suspension or termination).

Government data access requests. As a matter of general practice, OpenVPN does not voluntarily provide government agencies or authorities (including law enforcement) with access to or information about OpenVPN accounts (including Customer Data). If OpenVPN receives a compulsory request (whether through a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or other valid legal process) from any government agency or authority (including law enforcement) for access to or information about a OpenVPN account (including Customer Data) belonging to a data subject whose primary contact information indicates that the data subject is located in Europe, OpenVPN shall: (i) review the legality of the request; (ii) inform the government agency that OpenVPN is a processor of the data; (iii) attempt to redirect the agency to request the data directly from Customer; (iv) notify Customer via email sent to Customer’s primary contact email address of the request to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; and (v) provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to the agency or authority based on a reasonable interpretation of the request. As part of this effort, OpenVPN may provide the data subject’s primary and billing contact information to the agency. OpenVPN shall not be required to comply with this paragraph if it is legally prohibited from doing so, or it has a reasonable and good-faith belief that urgent access is necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual, public safety, the OpenVPN website, OpenVPN’s computer network and other assets, or to the Service.

**California:  
**Except as described otherwise, the definitions of: “controller” includes “Business”; “processor” includes “Service Provider”; “data subject” includes “Consumer”; “personal data” includes “Personal Information”; in each case as defined under the CCPA.

For this “California” section of Exhibit C only, “Permitted Purposes” shall include processing Customer Data only for the purposes described in this DPA and in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions as set forth in this DPA, as necessary to comply with applicable law, as otherwise agreed in writing, including, without limitation, in the Agreement, or as otherwise may be permitted for “service providers” under the CCPA.

OpenVPN’s obligations regarding data subject requests, as described in Section 7 of this DPA, extend to rights requests under the CCPA. Notwithstanding any use restriction contained elsewhere in this DPA, OpenVPN shall process Customer Data to perform the Service, for the Permitted Purposes and/or in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.

Notwithstanding any use restriction contained elsewhere in this Exhibit C, OpenVPN may de-identify or aggregate Customer Data as part of performing the Service specified in this DPA and the Agreement.

Where Sub-Processors process the Personal Information of Customer contacts, OpenVPN takes steps to ensure that such Sub-Processors are Service Providers under the CCPA with whom OpenVPN has entered into a written contract that includes terms substantially similar to this “California” section of Exhibit or are otherwise exempt from the CCPA’s definition of “sale”. OpenVPN conducts appropriate due diligence on its Sub-Processors.

**Canada:  
**OpenVPN takes steps to ensure that OpenVPN’s Sub-Processors are third parties under PIPEDA, with whom OpenVPN has entered into a written contract that includes terms substantially similar to this DPA. OpenVPN conducts appropriate due diligence on its SubProcessors.

OpenVPN will implement technical measures set forth in Section 4 of the DPA.
