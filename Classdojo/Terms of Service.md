ClassDojo Terms of Service

The following are the terms of service (“Terms of Service”) that define the relationship between ClassDojo, Inc. (doing business as ClassDojo (“Company,” “ClassDojo,” “we,” or “us”)) and you, and govern your use of ClassDojo’s services.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN A DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION [SECTION](#dispute-resolution), INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS AND WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH THE SERVICES. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 25 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION), YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND CLASSDOJO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

We’ve done our best to write this policy in simple, clear terms. We’ve also added summaries below each section that provide short explanations of the legal language in plain English (it starts with ‘Basically...’) to aid in understanding, but it isn’t legally binding.

You can see past versions of our Terms [here](https://github.com/classdojo/policies/blob/master/terms.md) on Github.

The ClassDojo Terms

Thank you for your interest in ClassDojo, which owns and operates the services offered on classdojo.com (“ClassDojo Website”), including the ClassDojo platform (“ClassDojo Platform”), and any associated mobile applications (“ClassDojo Apps”) or products and services that Company may provide now or in the future (collectively, the “Service”).

These Terms of Service contain general terms that apply to you as a user of the ClassDojo Service ("User"), along with additional terms that may apply to you as a User registered as a teacher, school leader, aide, or other similar personnel ("School Personnel"), or a parent. If you are School Personnel, you will also be subject to our [Student Data Protection Addendum (“DPA”)](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf). If you are purchasing any premium features like [ClassDojo Plus (“Premium Features”)](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) through the ClassDojo Service or partake in any sweepstakes, giveaways, or promotions we may offer you will be subject to the [ClassDojo Premium Features and Promotions Terms](https://www.classdojo.com/premium-features-terms/). The DPA, Premium Features and Promotions Terms and [Virtual Terms of Service](https://www.classdojo.com/virtual-tos) (collectively "Terms") are hereby incorporated by reference.

When using the Service, you will also be subject to the [ClassDojo Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy) and any posted guidelines, policies or rules applicable to specific features of the Service, which may be posted from time to time (collectively the “Guidelines”). These Terms of Service, Terms, including any other Guidelines and future modifications (collectively, the “Agreement”), govern your use of the Service and is a legal contract between you and ClassDojo. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms of Service, Terms, and any of the Guidelines, the additional Guidelines will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

Agreeing to our Terms

By registering for an account on, or otherwise accessing or using the ClassDojo Service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of an institution that has a separate written agreement with ClassDojo, that agreement governs your use of the Service.

If you are under the age of 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Agreement. If you don’t get your parent or guardian to read and agree to the Agreement, you don’t have permission to use the Service.

For Minor Users under the age of 13, ClassDojo follows the United States Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and its implementing regulations under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA") consent rules that prohibit online service providers from knowingly collecting personal information from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent or notice as applicable (“Consent”).

Consent may be obtained either by 1) ClassDojo if the parent is setting up a Student Account (as defined below) or Outside School Child Account (as defined below) directly or is allowing their child to use certain Premium Features within their parent account or otherwise access the Service, or the student has received a unique link from their teacher to set up their own Student Account; or 2) a student’s teacher, school, or district if the teacher, school or district is setting up the Student’s Account and allowing the Student to login or otherwise allowing Students to access ClassDojo from school (“ School Consent”).

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity (including if you are School Personnel entering on behalf of your school), you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms “you”, “your” or “User” shall refer to such entity. **If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the Service**.

> Basically,
> 
> By using or signing up for ClassDojo, you agree to these terms. If you are under the age of 18, your legal guardian or parent will need to review and agree to the Agreement on your behalf. Welcome to the community!

Registration and Security

As a condition to using Service, you may be required to register with Company and select a password and username or provide additional contact information ("Company User ID"). Alternatively, (1) an Institution or School Personnel or (2) a parent, may create accounts and logins for students or their child (“Student Login(s)”). When you register or create a Student Login, you must provide Company with accurate, complete, and updated Company User ID and Student Login information. You may not select or use as a Company User ID or Student Login, a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person. You will not provide any false information or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission. ClassDojo reserves the right to refuse registration or to cancel a ClassDojo ID or Student Login in its discretion.

You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials, ClassDojo ID, Student Login, password or QR code (“Account Credentials”) and will not share with anyone or let anyone else access your Account Credentials or account. You may not transfer your Account Credentials or account to anyone without express prior written consent of Company. Company will not be liable for any direct or indirect loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your Account Credentials, either with or without your knowledge or for a failure to comply with this Section. However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by ClassDojo or another party due to someone else using your Account Credentials.

You expressly agree to (a) immediately notify ClassDojo of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security of your Account Credentials, account or a child's personal information, and (b) ensure that you properly logout from your account at the end of each session.

You represent, warrant and covenant that (1) all Account Credential information you submit is truthful and accurate, and (2) if you are setting up a Student Login that you have obtained any and all necessary rights, permissions, or consents to access, setup, monitor, use or disclose any data from such accounts of other Users..

> Basically,
> 
> You should keep your QR code, username, password and any other login credentials secret!

Using the Service

_Permission to use ClassDojo_

As long as you are complying with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company gives you permission to access and use the Service solely to enable your use of the Service. The Service is available for your personal, noncommercial use and should only be used for [educational purposes](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#EducationalPurposes) or lawful purposes that help bring school communities together or help parents and children build stronger relationships at home. You may download a single copy of the ClassDojo App for personal, non-commercial use only.

Access to and use of the Service itself is free, but we do offer, and may add to in the future, optional [Premium Features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) that ClassDojo may charge for. Please also be aware that while we currently provide our mobile services for free, your carrier’s normal rates and fees still apply, such as text messaging and data fees.

The right to access and use the Service is revoked in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited, if any.

_Changes to the Service_

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether, including, for example, if you do not comply with this Agreement or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. You can stop using our Service at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. We may also add or create new limits to our Service or restrict your access to all or a part of the Service at any time without notice or liability.

We believe that you (or your school as applicable) own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service. Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004809286) for more information.

_Restrictions_

Except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, you agree that your permission to use the Service is conditioned upon you following all the restrictions set forth in the “[ClassDojo Technology](#classdojo-technology)” and “[Acceptable Use and Conduct](#acceptable-use-and-conduct)” sections.

> Basically,

ClassDojo does not claim any ownership rights in the User Content. Please note that, while you retain ownership of your User Content, any template or layout in which you arrange or organize such User Content through tools and features made available through any of our Service are not proprietary to you — rights to such templates or layouts will remain with us or our service providers.

_License_

User Content

In order to allow ClassDojo to provide the Service, you hereby grant to us a limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable (as necessary to perform the Service, including distributing Activities, and providing the Premium Features), worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable (only to a successor) right and license to:

1. use, host, copy, store, distribute, publicly perform and display, publish (in whole or in part), modify, and create derivative works (such as changes we make so that your content works better with our Service) such User Content as necessary to (a) provide, improve and make the Service available to you and other Users including through any future media in which the Service may be distributed;
2. use and disclose metrics and analytics regarding the User Content in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in improving our service or in marketing and business development purposes);
3. use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense Feedback without any compensation to you;
4. use any User Content (including any Student Data or Education Record) that has been de-identified for any product development, research or other lawful purpose subject to the DPA; and
5. use for other purposes permitted by the [DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf) and the [ClassDojo Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy).

Company will only share and use your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) in accordance with ClassDojo’s current Privacy Policy at http://www.classdojo.com/privacy.

Activities

By default, if School Personnel contribute Activities, such Activities will be licensed royalty-free to ClassDojo under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (“CC License”), which is available at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. Such Activities shall be available to the School Personnel's school and its Users, but ClassDojo may also sub-license such Activities to other Users of the Services at other schools. You acknowledge and agree that Activities will be licensed under the CC License unless you "opt-out" of sharing to other schools. Such Activities will continue to be licensed under the CC License until School Personnel “turns off” such sharing for that particular Activities. However, you understand and agree that if you "turn-off" sharing for Activities (i) the Activities will be available to Users within the School Personnel's school only; (ii) the change is prospective and does not terminate any sub-licenses to the underlying Activities previously granted by ClassDojo to any third parties (such as teachers from other schools and districts), and (iii) ClassDojo thereafter shall not grant any additional sub-licenses for the underlying Activities to third parties such as other schools.

_License Termination_

The license in 1(a) above will terminate when you or your Institution (as defined below) delete (i) any User Content with intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) (“IP content”)), (ii) personally identifiable information (such as that in Student Data or an Education Record), or (iii) your account. Such termination may not apply if your User Content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you post User Content in a [Class Story or School Story](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103), or [Portfolios](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732) this can be viewed by other teachers, students and parents and it means that you are allowing others to access and use that information and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture if you provide one as a teacher or parent).

Note, however, that any User Content that may be in an Education Record or Student Data (including User Content in or related to messages sent through [ClassDojo Messaging](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309), Class Story, or School Story or Portfolios, may be kept after you delete your account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g. maintenance of “education records” under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)). Please see the section entitled “Deleting your Account” in our Privacy Policy and our [deletion FAQs](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319) for more information. When you delete IP Content, Student Data, Education Records, or personal information, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer. However, you understand that any removed User Content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

_Your Responsibilities and ClassDojo Rights_

You agree that you, or your Institution, are responsible for making sure that you have all rights in the User Content, including the rights necessary for you to grant us the foregoing licenses to the User Content. Institution or School Personnel, as applicable, represents, covenants and agrees on behalf of yourself and your student Users that the submitting User (including your students) has all required rights to submit, post, upload or otherwise, own, use or disseminate the User Content it submits or uploads without violating any third-party rights. You are responsible for ensuring your User Content complies with the “[Acceptable Use and Conduct](#acceptable-use-and-conduct)” Section and for any other guidelines or conditions specific to a particular category of User (e.g., teacher, parent, or student). When you include User Content, you can create links to external websites. If you elect to create links to external websites, you must verify the quality and substance of each external link. You are solely responsible for any links you create to external websites. ClassDojo is not liable or responsible for any links created by you, or for any damages, direct or indirect, arising therefrom.

All information posted or transmitted through the Service is the responsibility of the person that posted it, and we will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content. ClassDojo cannot guarantee the identity of any other Users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Service, or the authenticity of any data which users may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all content accessed by you using the Service is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. You acknowledge that ClassDojo and its designees (such as teachers) reserve the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, filter, edit, remove, refuse to accept, post, display, or transmit any User Content through or on the Service in whole or in part at any time for any reason or no reason with or without notice and without liability of any kind. Additionally, we do not guarantee that we will publish any of your User Content, and reserve the right to remove User Content from the Service at any time for any reason, such as if we receive a notice reports a User Content infringes someone’s intellectual property rights.

\_Your Likeness \_

While ClassDojo does not permit User Content containing personal information of Users under the age of 13 to be public, if you as a parent or School Personnel, upload any User Content to any area of our Service in areas that my be viewed by others (for example, in Class Story or School Story) containing your likeness or the likeness of others, you also agree to the following:

You consent to the use of your likeness, and you have obtained (as necessary) the written consent, release, and/or permission of every identifiable individual who appears in your User Content to use such individual's likeness, for purposes of using and otherwise exploiting the User Content in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, or, if any such identifiable individual is under the age of eighteen (18), you have obtained any necessary written consent, release and/or permission from such individual's parent or guardian (and you agree to provide to us a copy of any such consents, releases and/or permissions upon our request). If you do submit a submission that contains the likeness of an identifiable individual under the age of eighteen (18), we strongly encourage you not to include any identifying information (such as the individual's first and last name or address) with such User Content.

_Analyzing User Submissions_ Our automated systems analyze your User Content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, and for spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored. ClassDojo will not analyze any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) contained in Educational Records or Student Data for the purpose of providing [behaviorally-targeted advertising](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) to students or parents. The foregoing shall not be construed to (i) prohibit ClassDojo from marketing or advertising directly to parents or other Users so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of personal information contained in Educational Records or Student Data obtained by ClassDojo from providing the Service (unless with parental/guardian consent), (ii) apply to the marketing of school memorabilia such as photographs, yearbooks or class rings, (iii) prohibit ClassDojo from using aggregate or [De-Identified Data](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#Deidentified) to inform, influence or enable marketing, advertising or other commercial efforts by ClassDojo, (iv) limit the ability of ClassDojo to use Educational Records or Student Data for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes, or (v) prohibit ClassDojo from using Student Data or Education Records to recommend educational products and services to parents/guardians, students or School Personnel so long as the recommendations are not based in whole or part in payment of other consideration from a third party.

> Basically,
> 
> You (or your school as applicable) own any content you post on ClassDojo. You also give us permission to use it to provide the ClassDojo service to you and other Users. Our use of any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) you submit is also subject to our [Privacy Policy](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy). You are responsible for making sure that you have all the rights in any information or content you submit to ClassDojo, including to grant us the license we need to provide the service. We do not guarantee that we will publish any of your content or information and we (or our designess, such as School Personnel) reserve the right (but have no obligation) to pre-screen, filter, or remove it from the service at any time, for any reason.

Privacy and Security

Your privacy is extremely important to us, and we take great care to limit what we collect and how we use it, and to enable you to understand our policies. Please read our Privacy Policy which explains how we treat your [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) and protect your privacy when you use our Service and for [more information](http://www.classdojo.com/privacy/#how-does-classdojo-protect-and-secure-my-information-) on the administrative, technical and physical safeguards we maintain to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to personal information.

In addition, please read the [DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf), which is an agreement between us and your school, and describes the duties and responsibilities to protect Student Data transmitted to ClassDojo.

Online Safety

If any user needs to report any abuse or inappropriate content on the Services that has either not been addressed (i) by the connected teacher or school if used in connection with a school or classroom, or (ii) the parent if the Services are used not in connection with a school or classroom, they may do so by reporting the user or content directly to ClassDojo from within the Services or by emailing at safety@classdojo.com

Any Student Account (or access to a Student Account) created for the Student by the parent, or the Student's teacher in class, or the Student directly, are [linked together](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205-What-are-Student-Accounts-and-Outside-School-Child-Accounts-#:~:text=%E2%80%9COutside%20School%20Child%20User%E2%80%9D%20means,features%20such%20as%20ClassDojo%20Plus.)

(iv) **Student User Content:** Teachers will [review](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022768191-How-are-student-posts-approved-before-sharing-with-their-families-) any User Content you as a Student upload to the Service in your [Portfolio](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732-What-is-ClassDojo-Portfolios-and-How-Does-it-Work) prior to the User Content appearing in your [Portfolio](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732-What-is-ClassDojo-Portfolios-and-How-Does-it-Work) for parents to see, but other students in your class may see your User Content if they inadvertently login as you with the code given in class. Once a post has been approved by the teacher, any subsequent comments or replies to that post by the student will be added without approval by the teacher and also become visible to the parent. If you are a Student, please do not provide any personal information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you use the Service or as directed by your parent, teacher, school, or district, such as through the use of the Portfolios feature or use of Premium Features or [Dojo Islands](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621) while in school.

Additional Terms for School Personnel

If you are a School Personnel accessing the Service on behalf of a school, school district, or other similar educational institution (the "Institution"), the following terms apply to you:

(i) **Permissions and Authority:** You agree that you are acting on behalf of (or have received all necessary permission from) your Institution to enter into this Agreement and to register and use the Service as part of your curriculum. Only School Personnel who are current employees of the Institution may use the Service on the Institution's behalf. The School Personnel is responsible for obtaining any necessary approvals from their school's authorities and administrators before using the Service. Upon termination of a School Personnel or other staff member's employment with the Institution, such individual must return and cease using all login details and Student access he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn a User of the Service claims to be affiliated with your Institution who is not, in fact, affiliated with your Institution, you will notify ClassDojo immediately at privacy@classdojo.com.

(ii) **Students under 13:** You further understand and acknowledge that COPPA prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) from children under 13 years of age without Consent and you understand that we will not let children under the age of 13 use certain features of the Service unless:

1. ClassDojo obtains [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) from the child's parent or legal guardian if 1) the parent is creating a Student Account for the Student on ClassDojo or allowing the Student to access and use the Services on the parent device; or 2) the Student has created their own Student Account using the unique student code given to them by their teacher; or
    
2. You provide [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) in situations where you set up the child's Student account on their behalf to enable them to [login](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210542566-How-Do-I-Log-Into-My-Student-Account-#web) or otherwise access certain features of the Service in the classroom (or at home for school purposes) which may result in the collection of personal information from the child. ClassDojo will not provide use of Student Accounts or access to the Service to children under the age of 13 if we are unable to obtain Consent or learn that you have not provided School Consent. You agree that you will not knowingly create a child's Student Account on their behalf or allow the child to use the Service in the classroom until you have provided [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986).
    

(iii) **School Consent**. You acknowledge and agree that ClassDojo has provided to you (a) the direct notice required under 16 C.F.R. Part 312.4 of COPPA as set forth [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986-For-teachers-Getting-consent-from-parents) ("Direct Notice") and (b) a link to ClassDojo's notice of privacy practices that includes a description of all personal information that is collected and how it will be used and disclosed as set forth [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986-For-teachers-Getting-consent-from-parents). Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that you have read the Direct Notice and privacy practices. You, on behalf of the Institution, (c) authorize ClassDojo to collect and use the [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d) of Students in the Service for [educational purposes;](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447) and (d) acknowledge and agree that you have the authority to authorize the collection described in (c) and to act as the agent of the parent.

Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that when this [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) described above is utilized to allow children under 13 to use the Service, you will be solely responsible (and hereby agree that ClassDojo is not responsible) for 1) providing all required notices and disclosures to parents under COPPA in a format you deem appropriate, including the Direct Notice (of which ClassDojo will provide relevant information to you and/or the Institutions or other School Personnel); 2) [acting as the agent of the parent](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#N.%20COPPA%20AND%20SCHOOLS) and consenting on their behalf) under COPPA; and 3) providing a means for a parent to review any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) contained in Student Data or Education Records collected through the Service and refuse to permit its further use as required by COPPA. For clarity, it is ClassDojo's obligation to comply with COPPA as a whole. To do this, we rely on schools to provide consent under COPPA by acting as the agent of the parent, but only after providing the school with the required information and notices as set forth [here](http://b/).

This includes without limitation, limiting access to the Service only to those Student Users from whom School Personnel has Consented for and complying with all parental requests regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such parent's child's personal information. If a Parent User rescinds such School Consent, School Personnel or the Institution shall immediately notify ClassDojo to discontinue that Student's access to the Service and ensure that such Student's information is no longer accessible through the Services. For more information on School Consent please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986). Under no circumstances will ClassDojo be liable for the School Personnel's failure to consult their school's authorities and administrators or for failing to provide School Consent when required.

(iv) **Parent Code**. Each Student the teacher inputs on ClassDojo is assigned a [unique parent code](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202047699-Connecting-to-Your-Child-s-Class-via-a-Parent-Code#web) by ClassDojo. This unique parent code is used by parents to connect with their child's updates from school on ClassDojo. Parents may register for an account on ClassDojo without the unique parent code, including to utilize the [Premium Features](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732) or to createan [Outside School Child Account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205-What-are-Student-Accounts-and-Outside-School-Child-Accounts-#:~:text=%E2%80%9COutside%20School%20Child%20User%E2%80%9D%20means,features%20such%20as%20ClassDojo%20Plus.), but will be unable to connect with their child's school to see their child's or the school's updates without a code or explicitly getting approved by a verified teacher to connect with a specific child (see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050943651-Request-to-Connect-to-Your-Child-s-Teacher#web)). Parents with a ClassDojo account may give Consent for their child to have a Student Account or Outside School Child Account on ClassDojo. It is your responsibility to ensure that each student only shares his/her unique parent code with his/her parents. It is solely the School Personnel's decision on how to communicate the parent code to the parent, including by sending home a private letter to the student's parent or otherwise contacting the parent directly. Alternatively, if the School Personnel has access to the student's parent contact information and has permission to do so, the School Personnel may provide ClassDojo with a list of parent email addresses or phone numbers for ClassDojo to send the parent code at the direction of and on behalf of the School Personnel (via email or SMS) to enable the parent to then create a parent account.

(v) **Verifying Parents.** School Personnel that are teachers, may be asked to [verify](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046903851-How-to-Connect-Parents-with-a-Class-Link#web) Parent Users as they sign-up for ClassDojo and ask to be connected to your class. You acknowledge and agree that ClassDojo may use this verification provided by School Personnel to assist with verifying the identity of the Parent User for [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046-For-parents-What-consent-must-parents-give-for-their-child-to-use-ClassDojo-) purposes.

With a Parent Account, you may then (i) create either a Student Account or Outside School Child Account for your child on the Service, (ii) allow your child to create their own account ("Student Created Accounted"), (iii) allow your child to access or use the Service, including on your device, without setting up a separate Outside School Child Account or Student Account. The following terms apply to you as a Parent User:

(i) **Creating Your Child's Student Account or Outside School Child Account:** If you would like to create your child's Student Account or Outside School Child Account at home, you must first have created a Parent Account on ClassDojo. IF YOU REGISTER OR CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR, APPROVE OR CONSENT TO THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER'S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE SERVICES BY THE CHILD USER.

To create your child's Student Account or Outside School Child Account, we will first require your [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603). In order to comply with COPPA and similar laws in other applicable jurisdictions, which govern the online collection of data from children, ClassDojo may take additional steps to verify that the user granting permission for the creation of a child's Student Account or Outside School Child Account is his or her parent or legal guardian. The current ways in which we seek to verify are set forth in our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046-For-parents-What-consent-must-parents-give-for-their-child-to-use-ClassDojo-). Any Student Account created by you, your child's teacher, or your child directly are linked together (these are not different accounts, but rather the same singular account). Additionally, any Outside School Child Account will also be linked with the Student Account (if both exist), but only certain content will be viewable by the child's teacher. Please see our [**FAQ**](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085) for more details.

(ii) **Your Consent:** If your child is under the age of 13, [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) must be given in order for 1) you to create the Student Account or Outside School Child Account; 2) your child to create a Student Created Account; or 3) your child's School Personnel to create a Student Account on behalf of your child, enabling them to [login](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210542566-How-Do-I-Log-Into-My-Student-Account-#web).

This Consent may be obtained either by: 1) ClassDojo if (a) you are setting up your child's Student Account or Outside School Child Account or (b) your child is setting up the Student Created Account or you are allowing your child to access or use the Service without setting up an account, including on your device or account; or 2) a Student's School Personnel (through [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986)) if they are setting up your child's Student Account, enabling them to [login](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210542566-How-Do-I-Log-Into-My-Student-Account-#web), or otherwise allowing them to access and use the Service in school.

In addition to providing Consent when creating your child's Outside School Child Account or Student Account, there may be instances where we will also ask you to provide additional Consent as set forth [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046)(e.g. heightened verifiable parental consent is done to ensure that if "school consent" was previously used, that we obtain your consent for the use of your child's personal information outside of the school context; or when some of the features that your child may use in Premium Features this may mean that we can't rely on the lower level of "verification" that you are the child's parent when we initially obtained your consent through the "email plus" method at the time you created your child's account).

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who is using the Service and your child's Student Account was not set up by your child's School Personnel, or you did not give Consent while setting up your child's Student Account or Outside School Child Account, you can email us at privacy@classdojo.com to have that child's Student Account or Outside School Account deleted. Please note that if you, as a parent, provide an email to School Personnel when the school is obtaining School Consent, we may send an email asking you to verify your child's account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service.

(iii) **Responsible for Your Child's User Content:** Once your child has a Student Account or Outside School Child Account, they will be able to upload User Content, including Student Activity Responses, to the Student Account and [Portfolios](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732-What-is-ClassDojo-Portfolios-and-How-Does-it-Work-) (which is not viewable by the general public, but by linked parents, legal guardians and School Personnel) as well as in their Outside School Child Account, including in [Dojo Islands](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621). You are solely responsible for reviewing and ensuring that such User Content submissions (when not submitted during or in connection with school use) meet all applicable conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those in "[Your Information and Content](https://www.classdojo.com/terms/#your-information-and-content)" and the "[Acceptable Use and Conduct](https://www.classdojo.com/terms/#acceptable-use-and-conduct)" Sections and are solely responsible for any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) contained therein (if not removed by you). You can request to remove any User Content uploaded by your child either by 1) contacting your child's School Personnel if the User Content was uploaded during school, and we will respond to valid requests received from the School Personnel or Institution, or 2) contacting us directly at privacy@classdojo.com when the User Content is collected directly from your child through their Outside School Child Account.

(iv) **Premium Features:** If you are accessing or using the Premium Features, or allowing your child to access and use them, you will also be subject to the [Premium Features Terms](https://www.classdojo.com/premium-features-terms/). Additionally, if you are allowing your child to access and use Premium Features on your device or account, we will first require your [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603). We may also seek your [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603)for the use of certain Premium Features if [School Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986) was previously used. Additionally, if you or your child is utilizing a feature where [Student Data](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca) or education records under [FERPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/TeacherResources/FERPAPrimer/FERPAPrimer.pdf) will be used and shared between in school and out of school use (use not in connection with a school), you are consenting to this use and sharing. See our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Plus-FAQ) for more information.

(v) **Home Dojo Islands:** If you choose to allow your child to use the [Home Dojo Islands](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621) feature with their Outside School Child Account, the following conditions and limitations apply:

1. Using the [Home Dojo Islands](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621) feature, you may elect to allow your child to engage in the experiences and activities of Home Dojo Islands through their Outside School Child Account after providing [Consent](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) for this use.

It is your responsibility to decide whether to grant permission for your child to use Home Dojo Islands. ClassDojo is not responsible for your selection of which children you give access to the Home Dojo Islands feature with their Outside Child Account. If you have given your Consent and your child visits the Home Dojo Islands, you agree that some of their information may be seen by other children also playing in Home Dojo Islands (including their classmates), but not the general public. Please see [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085) for more details on what other children may see about your child while in Home Dojo Islands and how children can interact with each other.
    
2.

> Basically, Parents: We'll need your [permission](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603) to set up your child's Student Account or Outside School Child Account if they are under 13 or you allow them to access Premium Features or Home Dojo Islands on your device,. The current ways in which we seek to verify are set forth in our Consent [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046-For-parents-What-consent-must-parents-give-for-their-child-to-use-ClassDojo-). In addition to providing Consent when creating your child's Outside School Child Account or Student Account, there may be instances where we will also ask you to provide additional Consent as set forth [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046). If your child's teacher or other school personnel wants to create your child's student account on their behalf, they will act as your agent and consent on your behalf in what is commonly referred to as "school consent". You are solely responsible for reviewing and ensuring that your child's User Content submissions (when not submitted during or in connection with school use) meet all applicable conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those in "[Your Information and Content](https://www.classdojo.com/terms/#your-information-and-content)" and the "[Acceptable Use and Conduct](https://www.classdojo.com/terms/#acceptable-use-and-conduct)" Sections and are solely responsible for any [personal information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703) contained therein (if not removed by you).

See our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Plus-FAQ) for more information.

FERPA

ClassDojo understands that it is important that our partner schools comply with the [Family Education Rights and Privacy Act](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) (FERPA) and related regulations. Certain information that may be provided to ClassDojo by School Personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an Institution, may be considered an [education record](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004773623) under FERPA ("Education Record"). Additionally, certain information, provided to Company by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered [directory information](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004773623) under FERPA ("Directory Information") and thus not an Education Record. Please see our [Student DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf) for more information regarding FERPA, ClassDojo's commitments to help Institution's comply with FERPA, and Institution's obligations with respect to FERPA.

Institutions may not generally disclose[personal information](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99/subpart-A/section-99.3)from an eligible student's Education Record to a third-party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA ("FERPA Exemption(s)"), including the exemption for Directory Information ("Directory Information Exemption") or School Official (as that term is defined in FERPA) exemption ("School Official Exemption"). For the purposes of FERPA, to the extent personal information from Education Records are transmitted to ClassDojo from an Institution or from Students using accounts at the direction of the Institution, ClassDojo shall be considered a School Official with a legitimate educational interest, and performing services otherwise provided by the Institution.

If the Institution has a policy of disclosing Education Records under FERPA, the Institution shall include a specification of criteria for determining who constitutes a School Official and what constitutes a legitimate educational interest in its annual notification of FERPA rights ("Annual Notification of Rights"). Additionally, the Institution represents, warrants and covenants to ClassDojo, as applicable, that the Institution has:

1. Complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their Annual Notification of Rights that the Institution defines "School Official" to include service providers such as ClassDojo and defines "legitimate educational interest" to include services such as the type provided by ClassDojo; and/or
2. Complied with the Directory Information Exemption (if relying on such exemption), including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Institution deems to be Directory Information and may be disclosed and allowing parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools not disclose Directory Information about them; and/or
3. Obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the Student Data with ClassDojo, in each case, solely to enable ClassDojo's operation of the Service.

If the Institution is relying on the Directory Information exemption, Institution represents, warrants, and covenants to ClassDojo that it shall not provide information to ClassDojo from any student or parent/legal guardian that has opted out of the disclosure of Directory Information. ClassDojo depends on the Institution to ensure that the Institution is complying with the FERPA provisions regarding the disclosure of any Education Records or Student Data that will be shared with ClassDojo. ClassDojo is not in a position to provide legal advice regarding whether the school's existing FERPA disclosures are sufficient. To the extent that School Personnel or the Institutions have questions regarding these issues, they should consult the school's own legal counsel for more information.

> Basically, FERPA gives parents and students certain rights over their [education records](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004773623). FERPA requires schools to not share [PII](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5177ee2981c26c75fa0c88df117d75a8&node=34:1.1.1.1.33.1.134.3&rgn=div8) in education records without either meeting an exemption or obtaining parental permission. So, if a teacher provides student information to ClassDojo, the school must either meet an exemption or obtain the appropriate permission in advance. Please see our [Student DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2019-07-ClassDojo_DPA.pdf) for more information regarding FERPA, ClassDojo's commitments to help Institution's comply with FERPA, and Institution's obligations with respect to FERPA.

Linked Accounts

ClassDojo permits Users to associate an [Outside School Child Account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205-What-are-Student-Accounts-and-Outside-School-Child-Accounts-#:~:text=%E2%80%9COutside%20School%20Child%20User%E2%80%9D%20means,features%20such%20as%20ClassDojo%20Plus.) with their [Student Account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205-What-are-Student-Accounts-and-Outside-School-Child-Accounts-#:~:text=%E2%80%9COutside%20School%20Child%20User%E2%80%9D%20means,features%20such%20as%20ClassDojo%20Plus.), by using the same login credentials associated with an Outside School Child Account to join a class or use the account for school-directed learning. Similarly, a User may choose to associate their Student Account with their Outside School Child Account in the same manner. If a User chooses to associate an Outside School Child Account with their Student Account, the two accounts will be deemed "Linked Accounts". The Linked Accounts will use the same login to access both accounts, but the product data for in-school and out of school use is stored separately and only certain content will be viewable by School Personnel. Note however, that the login data (the username and password) is stored in one place and shared between both the Outside School Child Account and the Student Account. Please see our [**FAQ**](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205-What-are-Student-Accounts-and-Outside-School-Child-Accounts-#:~:text=%E2%80%9COutside%20School%20Child%20Account%E2%80%9D%20is,they%20are%20not%20separate%20accounts.) for more details. Parents and Students can also choose to reuse an existing Student Account for home or create a new Outside School Child Account for home activity not associated with a school or classroom.

Student Data shall not include information that a Student User or Parent User provides to ClassDojo through such Outside School Child Accounts independent of that Student's or parent's engagement of the Services at the direction of the Institution. Additionally, a parent may provide consent for the use of certain categories of Student Data in a non-school context through the use of the Outside School Child Account (e.g., certain limited data sharing in [Dojo Islands](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621-What-is-the-ClassDojo-Monster-Island-)[)](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621-What-is-the-ClassDojo-Monster-Island-). Prior to the termination of Student Accounts (or this Agreement) at the direction of School Personnel or Institution, ClassDojo may, at the request of School Personnel or the Institution, or the Student or the Student's parent or legal guardian, transfer Student Generated Content (as that term is defined in the [Student DPA](https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf) and/or various Privacy Laws) to the Outside School Child Account instead of deleting such content to enable ongoing ownership by Student Users or Parent Users. Transfer in this case may mean retaining the Student Generated Content within the previously created and Linked Outside School Child Account upon any request to delete the Student Account by the Institution.

Text, SMS, and other messaging

ClassDojo, on behalf of and at the direction of an Institution, may send Parent Users informational text messages or invites from your child's Institution, including, but not limited to, messages: (1) providing information related to a Parent User or their child's use of the Services; (2) supplying information that they request; or (3) responding to their inquiries regarding their account or use of ClassDojo. If you as a Parent User, provide your telephone number to your child's school, you are consenting to ClassDojo (on behalf of and at the direction of your child's school) sending informational text messages closely related to the Institution's mission.

Additionally, if as a User, you have created an account on the Service, and have provided ClassDojo directly with your phone number or email, you further agree that we may send you messages, invites, alerts, and other communications through the Service, including via email, web alert, text messages, push notifications and other similar means, in accordance with the preferences you set through the Service. Additionally, ClassDojo may send School Personnel and Parent Users marketing messages not on behalf of the Institution. ClassDojo does not charge you for our text message features. But message and data rates may apply whether you send or receive messages, so depending on your plan with your wireless or other applicable provider, you may be charged by your carrier or other applicable provider. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system. IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF MARKETING MESSAGES FROM CLASSDOJO, YOU CAN EMAIL [PRIVACY@CLASSDOJO.COM](mailto:privacy@classdojo.com) OR TEXT THE WORD "STOP" TO THE NUMBER FROM WHICH YOU ARE RECEIVING THE MESSAGES. You may continue to receive text messages for a short period while we process your request, including a message confirming the receipt of your opt-out request. Your agreement to receive marketing texts is not a condition of any purchase on or use of the Service.

> Basically, You may receive text messages, emails, and other notifications from ClassDojo relating to but not limited to your, your child, or Student's activity on ClassDojo or in response to information you request. Additionally, ClassDojo may send you promotions and announcements.You can opt out at any time by adjusting your notification preferences or contacting [privacy@classdojo.com](mailto:privacy@classdojo.com)

If you choose to use such features, you grant Company permission to access and use your Linked Account for the purpose of processing your requests. Additionally, if you decide to use a Linked Account to register for a ClassDojo account through an authentication service (such as Google Accounts, Microsoft Accounts, Facebook Connect, or Clever) ("Authentication Service") you give ClassDojo the permission to store and use certain information already associated with your Authentication Service consistent with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.classdojo.com/privacy/).

You should check your privacy settings on each Authentication Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Authentication Service. Please review each Authentication Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service. Your use of Linked Accounts and Authentication Services is subject to the applicable third-party terms and privacy policies.

> Basically, If you want to login through or use third-party services with your ClassDojo account (e.g., Google Apps), we'll help you connect your account to those services so you can use them, and you are giving us permission to store and use certain information already associated with your authentication service.

> Basically, ClassDojo is a free service and is provided “as-is.” We’re not liable to you for indirect, or special damages if something goes wrong.

You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of ClassDojo. ClassDojo will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

User Interactions and Release

**User Disputes**. ClassDojo is not responsible for the actions, content, information or data of other third parties, including other Users.

You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline interaction with any other person.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes of a similar effect.

> Basically, There are many people who use ClassDojo. Although we expect every user to follow our guidelines, we are not responsible for their actions. We’ll enforce our acceptable use and other guidelines, but we won’t get involved in, nor are we responsible for any disputes you may have with other users of ClassDojo.

Copyright Protection

It is ClassDojo’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA“). For more information, please go to ClassDojo’s [DMCA Notification Guidelines](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203858619). ClassDojo may remove any allegedly infringing content without any liability to you. ClassDojo will promptly terminate without notice any User’s access to the Service where the User is a “repeat infringer” of copyrights. ClassDojo, however, reserves the right to identify and terminate Users under any circumstances it deems appropriate, including after only a single instance of allegedly infringing behavior by that User.

ClassDojo’s policies prohibit you from providing User Content that infringes trademarks. If you provide User Content that infringes trademarks, your User Content can be blocked or removed. If you are a trademark owner that believes your trademark is being infringed, please note that we are not in a position to mediate disputes between users and the holders of trademark rights. However, we will look into and try to resolve any allegations of trademark infringement by following the similar process as our DMCA Notification Guidelines for trademarks.

> Basically,
> 
> We respect copyright and trademarks. If you see any violations, please see our [DMCA Notification Guidelines](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203858619).

Term and Termination

This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service unless your account is terminated as provided in this Agreement ("Term"). All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

**Termination by ClassDojo:** For non-school based accounts (including parents not connected to a school or Outside School Child Users):ClassDojo may suspend or terminate your access to the Service or your account at any time, for any reason (without cause or for your violation of any term of this Agreement), and without warning or notice, which may result in the loss of information associated with your account. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services or any account you may have, or portion thereof, may be affected without prior notice, and you agree that ClassDojo shall bear no responsibility or liability to you or any third party for any damages or claims resulting from or in connection with such actions, including the loss of information associated with your account.

**Termination by ClassDojo of School Personnel, Institutions, Parent Users Connected to Schools or Students:** You acknowledge that, if you knowingly, intentionally or negligently violate this Agreement, ClassDojo may suspend your license to the Services, in whole or in part, until the violation has stopped or terminate your license and use of the Services. In the event that you fail to correct the violation after reasonable notice from ClassDojo, ClassDojo may terminate your license and use of the Services and this Agreement. You agree and if such termination or suspension occurs, ClassDojo shall bear no responsibility or liability for any damages or claims resulting from or in connection with such actions, including the loss of information associated with your account.

The following does not apply in the unforeseen circumstances in which ClassDojo ceases operations or files for bankruptcy at which point ClassDojo may terminate or suspend all User accounts and licenses with or without notice to you, and with no liability to you. We believe that you (or your school as applicable) own your data and preserving access to such data is important. If we discontinue the Service (such as if we went out of business), where reasonably possible, we will give you advance notice and a chance to get information out of the Service. Click [here](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004809286) for more information.

**Termination by School Personnel:** School Personnel may terminate their use of the Service (or their account) or a Student Account at any time by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com provided, however, that an Institution may require satisfaction of certain requirements before School Personnel can terminate their account or before a Student Account can be terminated. Prior to the termination of Student Accounts (or this Agreement) at the direction of School Personnel or Institution, ClassDojo may, at the request of School Personnel or the Institution, or the Student or the Student's parent or legal guardian, transfer Student Generated Content (as that term is defined in the Student DPA and/or various Privacy Laws) to the [Outside School Child Account](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms) instead of deleting such content to enable ongoing ownership by Student Users or Parent Users. Transfer in this case may mean retaining the Student Generated Content within the previously created and Linked Outside School Child Account upon any request to delete the Student Account by the Institution.

**Termination by Parents:** As a parent, if you created your child's Student Account (or your child is not using the Service at school with an Outside School Child Account), you can also terminate your child's account by contacting us at [privacy@classdojo.com](mailto:privacy@classdojo.com) , although we will need to verify your identity (such as requiring that you send the request to us from the same email address you used to provide your consent to activate the student account originally). Parents of students whose Student Accounts were created (or directed to be used by) your child's teacher in school will first need to contact your child's school to request termination due to legal obligations under FERPA and various state student privacy laws.

Please see our [FAQ](https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730319) for what information is deleted when you terminate or delete your account.

> Basically, There is no obligation to use our Service, and you can stop using your account, or delete it completely, at any time. We can do that for you, too. However, if you are a Student (or parent of a Student) – you (or you parent) must first contact your school if you wish to terminate your Student Account and your school can tell you what the process will be. Additionally, we might suspend or terminate your account if you violate our rules or the law. If you are using the Service not in connection with a school, we may suspend or terminate your account at any time for any reason.

Dispute Resolution

1. Generally: In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Company in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Company agree that, except as provided in subsection (b) below, any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Except as provided in subsection (b) below, our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
2. Exceptions: Notwithstanding subsection (a), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
3. Opt-Out: If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 25 within 30 days after the date that you first agreed to the company's Terms of Service by sending a letter to Class Dojo, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 735 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (" **Opt-Out Notice**"). Once the Company receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 23 will be void and any action arising out of this Terms of Service will be resolved as set forth in Section 27. The remaining provisions of this Terms of Service will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.
4. Arbitration: Any arbitration between you and Company will be governed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("AAA Rules"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company.
5. Notice; Process: A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Company's address for Notice is: Class Twist, Inc., 735 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"), and (c) identify the name or account of the party making the claim. We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
6. Arbitration Relief: Except as provided in subsection (h) (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by the Company before an arbitrator was selected, the Company will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (ii) US$10,000. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
7. Fees: In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, or if the Company has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise , provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
8. No Class Actions: you and company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
9. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision: If the Company makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company's address for Notice, in which case your account with the Company will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
10. Enforceability: if only subsection (h) of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 25 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in Section 29 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.

> Basically, It is our goal to quickly and efficiently resolve disputes that may arise. For that reason, we require disputes to be submitted to arbitration. If you bring a dispute in arbitration that is $10,000 or less, ClassDojo will pay all the filing fees and make arrangements for telephonic or video-based proceedings (if you prefer). Additionally, we each waive rights to bring class actions.

Experimental Features

We may provide experimental features for you to try. These experimental features are not guaranteed to work the first time or any time. These features may abruptly and unexpectedly cease functioning, or disappear altogether. Other features of ClassDojo are not regularly tested for compatibility with experimental features. To enable an experimental feature, turn the switch on within a teacher account’s Settings. Experimental features will be added and old ones removed, possibly (probably) without notice.

> Basically,
