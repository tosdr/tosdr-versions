It is designed to be both anticipatory and responsive based on your search terms, information you enter in reply to the Virtual Assistantâs questions, and your account and other information on file with Fidelity. Your interactions with our Virtual Assistant may be recorded and shared with our service providers that provide technology and services used in our Virtual Assistant or are used for other business purposes.
    * The Virtual Assistant is not designed to recommend the purchase or sale of specific securities or digital assets. While it may offer educational information, it doesnât have the capability to discern what investment choices would be suitable for your personal situation.
    * Do not attempt to place trade orders through the Virtual Assistant; it can provide you with guidance as to how to place a trade at Fidelity, but the Virtual Assistant cannot execute trades on your behalf.
    * Any personal, account, or other information you provide to the Virtual Assistant, as well as all search information entered, may be retained, accessible to Fidelity personnel, and used and shared consistent with Fidelityâs Privacy Policy. Notwithstanding, you should not provide the Virtual Assistant with credit or debit card information or protected health information.Â

    -------------------
    
    * The Fidelity websites includes general news and information, commentary, interactive tools, quotes, research reports, data and other material, including ratings, concerning the financial markets, securities, digital assets, and other subjects. Some of this content is supplied by companies that are not affiliated with any Fidelity entity (âThird Party Contentâ). The Third Party Content is protected by copyright pursuant to United States laws and international treaties and is owned or licensed by the providers, their affiliates or their suppliers of such Third Party Content (âThird Party Content Providersâ). You acknowledge and agree that the Third Party Content is and shall remain valuable intellectual property owned by the Third Party Content Providers, and that no proprietary rights are being transferred to you with respect to such content. Reproduction of any Third Party Content in any form is prohibited except with the prior written permission of the Third Party Content Provider credited. Any use by you of such Third Party Content beyond the scope of the services provided to you by Fidelity generally requires a license from the Third Party Content Provider, along with an associated fee based on usage.
    * Neither Fidelity nor any Third Party Content Provider guarantees the accuracy, timeliness, completeness, usefulness, or availability of Third Party Content, nor is Fidelity or any Third Party Content Provider responsible for any errors or omissions in Third Party Content (negligent or otherwise), regardless of the cause, or for the results obtained from the use of such Third Party Content. In no event shall Fidelity or any Third Party Content Provider be liable for any damages, costs, expenses, legal fees, or losses (including lost income or lost profit and opportunity costs) in connection with any use of Third Party Content. A reference to a particular investment or security, a rating or any observation concerning an investment that is part of the Third Party Content is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold such investment or security, does not address the suitability of an investment or security for any particular investor, and should not be relied on as investment advice. Credit ratings are statements of opinions and are not statements of fact.
    * You accept and assume all risks of using any Third Party Content. The inclusion of any Third Party Content on the Fidelity websites does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation from Fidelity of such Third Party Content or the Third Party Content Provider.

    * NEITHER FIDELITY NOR ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDER WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR OTHERWISE. FIDELITY AND ITS THRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR LOST PROFITS, TRADING LOSSES, AND/OR ANY DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM USE OF OR LOSS OF USE OF THE FIDELITY WEBSITES AND MATERIALS ON THE FIDELITY WEBSITES (WHETHER PROVIDED BY FIDELITY OR THIRD PARTIES).

IF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES OR REMEDIES IN THESE TERMS ARE DETERMINED BY A COURT OR ARBITRATION PANEL TO NOT APPLY TO YOU OR TO BE UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE CONSTRUED TO APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF FIDELITY AND ALL THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FIDELITY WEBSITES, OR ANY FIDELITY OR THIRD PARTY CONTENT ON THE FIDELITY WEBSITES, EXCEED $100.

20. Predispute Arbitration Clause
    -----------------------------
    
    * **These Terms are subject to a predispute arbitration clause. Under this clause, you and Fidelity agree as follows:**
        * **All parties to this agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.**
        * **Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.**
        * **The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.**
        * **The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.**
        * **The panel of arbitrators may include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.**
        * **The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.**Â 
        * **The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this agreement.**
    * All controversies that may arise between you and Fidelity concerning any subject matter, issue or circumstance whatsoever (including, but not limited to controversies concerning any account, order distribution, rollover, advice interaction, or transaction, or the continuation, performance, interpretation or breach of this or any other agreement between you and Fidelity, whether entered into or arising before, on or after the date of these Terms) shall be determined by arbitration through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity, or entities against whom the claim is made is a member, as you may designate.
    * If you commence arbitration through a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange and the rules of that organization or exchange fail to be applied for any reason, then you shall commence arbitration with any other United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity, or entities against whom the claim is made is a member. If you do not notify Fidelity in writing of your designation within five (5) days after such failure or after you receive from Fidelity a written demand for arbitration, then you authorize Fidelity to make such designation on your behalf. The commencement of arbitration through a particular self-regulatory organization or securities exchange is not integral to the underlying agreement to arbitrate. You understand that judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    * No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any predispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein.
    * This predispute arbitration agreement survives the termination of the relationship between you and Fidelity, cancellation or end of any particular account or program, and any opt-out by you with respect to Fidelity communications, products, or services.
21. Modification of These Terms
    ---------------------------
    
    * Fidelity Investments may modify these Terms at any time without notice to you, except where required by law. When we make changes to these Terms, we will change the âLast Updatedâ date specified at the beginning of these Terms. The most current version of these Terms can be reviewed by clicking on the âTerms of Useâ link located at the bottom of the Fidelity websites. Use of the Fidelity websites shall constitute acceptance by you of the Terms in effect as of such time.
22. Governing law
    -------------
    
    * These Terms and their enforcement are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflicts of law, and shall inure to the benefit of Fidelityâs successors and assigns, whether by merger, consolidation, or otherwise.
23. Severability
    ------------
    
    * If a court of competent jurisdiction deems any provision of these Terms to be unenforceable or in conflict with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, either present or future, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
