General
-------

At Freenom, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you and your domain name, payment method to process registrations only. Please review the Freenom Privacy Policy for more information.

[Privacy Policy](https://www.freenom.com/en/doc_privacypolicy_v0110.pdf)

Free Domains
------------

This is the standard way of registration. It's a free service! You need to have a website, homepage or web page online on an existing web address or the capability of setting up your own website/server with content. Every Internet user who surfs to your free domain address will automatically go to the website address you have registered. You can change your website address any time to redirect your users to a different website or web page.

Next to the terms and conditions of free domain names, free domain name registrations are subject to content policies set out by the top level domain name registries. Please find these content policies below.

Paid Domains
------------

As a PAID domain name registrant, you receive the benefits of holding the legal license rights of the domain name. This means that you can register the domain for a longer period of time (1-10 years) and where you identify yourselves in the WHOIS record of the domain. Legal license holders (paid domain name registrants) are able to sell or transfer their domains - just like it is common with any top level domain.
