13\. Acceptable Usage Policy
----------------------------

13.1. To maintain the highest levels of deliverability for our customers, we do not allow certain types of email content as a policy.

13.2. Emails sent to market or sell goods, without adding any value to the subscriber, are not allowed. These emails receive a large number of spam complaints from subscribers. This results in a lower reputation score as an email service provider. This then has the ability to hurt the deliverability of our other customers.

13.3. Don’t use HelpCrunch to send anything offensive, promote anything illegal, or harass anyone. You may not send:  
  
a) Campaigns offering to sell illegal goods or services  
b) Emails that violate [CAN-SPAM Laws](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)  
c) Pornography/sexually explicit content  
d) Content that may incite violence, illegal activity, or contain hate speech  
e) Misrepresenting or impersonating another individual, business, or association with an individual or business

13.4. Some industries have higher-than-average abuse complaints, which can jeopardize the deliverability of our entire system. In order to maintain the highest delivery rates possible for all our customers, we can’t allow businesses that offer these types of services, products, or content:  
  
a) Content that in any way exploits minors under 18 years of age  
b) Viruses, worms, phishing, malware, or any other potentially harmful software  
c) Purchased or rented lists (of any form)  
d) Disguised self-identity, website, or industry  
e) Poor performance due to your list collection methods or low-quality content  
f) Any content that is reported to us as unsolicited or may be perceived as spam

13.5. The type of Affiliate Marketing we allow:  
  
a) Emails that educate subscribers or provide something of value MAY include affiliate links. These kinds of emails do not lead to spam complaints, and we allow them.  
b) Sending information about your own affiliate program to your registered affiliates is allowed.  
c) We also allow sending of affiliate marketing content to engaged subscribers. This content is expected by the subscriber base and does not result in spam complaints.

13.6. What type of Affiliate Marketing is not allowed:  
  
a) We do not allow emails with the sole purpose to send affiliate links to a large number of subscribers.  
a) We do not allow affiliate emails that endorse a third-party product or service "out of the blue". Promotion for a 3rd party product should include education about that product.  
a) We do not allow emails with suspicious or spammy content. This includes get-rich-quick schemes, gambling, and multi-level marketing, among others.

13.7. We continually monitor accounts to ensure best practices are being followed. We review bounce, spam complaint, and unsubscribe rates to ensure accounts are operating within our terms. Elevated bounce, complaint, or unsubscribe rates may result in a manual review, suspension, or termination of the account. Any account closed for such a reason will not be entitled to a refund or export of any data or details including Subscriber lists.
