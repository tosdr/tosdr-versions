**Information We Collect**

We have collected the above-stated categories of personal information about consumers in the past twelve (12) months

**Sources of Information**

We collect the categories of personal information listed above from the following categories of sources:

1\. From users, including clients, bloggers, and their subscribers.

**Use of Personal Information**

We may use or disclose personal information for one or more of the following business purposes:

1\. advertising and related statistics and data analysis.

**Sharing Personal Information**

We have not disclosed consumer personal information in the past twelve (12) months.

**Sale of Personal Information**

We have not sold consumer personal information in the past twelve (12) months.

**Your Rights and Choices**

The CPPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how you can exercise those rights.

Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights

You have the right to request that  HypeAuditor disclose to you certain information about our collection and use of your personal information in the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see the Exercising Your Access and Deletion Rights section below), we will disclose to you:

1\. The categories of personal information we collected about you;

2\. The categories of sources from which we collected personal information about you;

3\. Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information;

4\. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information; and

5\. The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you (also called a data portability request).

Deletion Request Rights

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we have received and confirmed your verifiable consumer request, we will delete, and direct any of our service providers to delete, your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:

1\. Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;

2\. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;

3\. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;

4\. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;

5\. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.);

6\. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;

7\. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;

8\. Comply with a legal obligation; or

9\. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

Exercising Your Access and Deletion Rights

To exercise your access and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us at [dpo@hypeauditor.com](mailto:dpo@hypeauditor.com). You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

1\. Provide enough information for us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and

2\. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. You are not required to make an account with us to make a verifiable consumer request. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response electronically or by mail, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Non-Discrimination

You have the right to not be discriminated against in pricing and services because you exercise any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not use whether or not you have exercised your CCPA rights to:

1\. Deny you goods or services;

2\. Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;

3\. Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or

4\. Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

**Changes To This Privacy Notice**

We may amend this Privacy Notice from time to time to maintain compliance with the law and to reflect any changes to our data collection process. We recommend you check this Privacy Notice from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes. If necessary, we may notify you by email of changes to this Privacy Notice.

6.3. Important information for data controllers:​ you acknowledge that when processing personal data of individuals, you may become a data controller and you must comply with GDPR.

6.4. If you are an individual and process personal data in the course of a purely personal or “household” activity, you may be exempt from the application of GDPR. If you are unsure whether this exemption applies, please, obtain legal advice.

6.5. If you are a legal person, you may become a data controller for the purposes of GDPR when you process personal data about natural persons. This is the case whether you obtain personal data through Us or through any other third party (for instance, if you manually compile your own database from Social media). If GDPR applies to you, you hereby confirm that you and Us (the “Parties”):

1) with respect to the Services where each (you and Us) independently determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, and neither of the Parties processes personal data on behalf of the other Party,

\- We and you act as **independent controllers**; and

\- the Parties do not jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing and do not act as joint controllers; and

\- each of the Parties shall independently take all necessary measures to comply with applicable data protection laws;

2) with respect to the Services (e.g. Campaign Management) where you determine the purposes and essential means of the processing of personal data (e.g. which and whose personal data to process, how long to store them), and We may determine technical means of the processing of personal data (e.g. where and how to search, collect, store the personal data), and We process personal data on your behalf or on your orders and in your interests,

\- **You** act as **controller**, and

\- **We** act as **processor**, and

\- each of the Parties shall take all necessary measures to comply with applicable data protection laws, and

\- this [**DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT (CONTROLLER-TO-PROCESSOR)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ehD--G36hrCM2VKCw0ak9MKNGYSUKiz1/view?usp=sharing) applies and enters in force between the Parties.

6.6. If the data subject requests information about the customer who received the personal data of the data subject, HypeAuditor is obliged to perform and performs the transfer of all information about you to that data subject.

6.7. Where we are processor, if a data subject sends to us his/her requests to be treated and answered on behalf of the controller (you, customer), we are obligated by applicable law and by the Data Processing Agreement to cooperate with the controller (i.e. we might be obligated to treat such requests, to inform the controller, to answer to data subjects). **You agree that we are entitled to charge you reasonable fees and handling costs for such cooperation**

6.8. If you have transferred The Report received when using our service to third parties, you are obliged to inform us of the entire chain of persons to whom such a Report was transferred, within 72 hours after the HypeAuditor's request.

**6.9.** **Prohibited Email Actions** 

1) You may not use Services to send spam. In particular, you may not use Campaign Management for spam mailing. Spam exists both in the form of bulk email and in form of one-to-one commercial emails.

Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages that have substantively similar content. Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited. Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted consent for such mailing.
