**CharityWatch Privacy Policy**  
  
**Introduction & Scope**  
The American Institute of Philanthropy, dba CharityWatch (herein referred to as “CharityWatch,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), respects the privacy of our donors and web site visitors and are committed to protecting personal information entrusted to us. This document describes our policy related to the gathering and disseminating of information obtained from users of our services. 

This Privacy Policy applies to CharityWatch’s hard copy publications and its web site located at **[www.charitywatch.org](https://www.charitywatch.org/home)** (“Site” or “Web Site”). The policy relates to information we collect, including personally identifiable information as well as information that does not identify donors and Web Site users personally. Our Web Site contains links to third-party web sites for the convenience of its visitors. This policy does not apply to web sites owned or operated by other organizations, companies, or individuals, as these third-parties may have their own privacy policies related to the information they collect from you.  
 

**Types of Personally Identifiable Information Collected & How It May Be Used**  
CharityWatch collects and stores the personally identifiable information of its donors, members, and others who have contacted or requested information from CharityWatch. Such information may include names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses. **We do not share personal information—such as names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, or email addresses—with anyone, except to the extent necessary to process transactions and provide access to, or information about, CharityWatch's information and services**. CharityWatch takes practical measures to protect the personal information we collect and does not disclose this information to  third-parties for their marketing or fundraising purposes.

_**Names**_  
CharityWatch collects first and/or last names voluntarily provided to us by donors, members, visitors to our Web Site, and others who have requested information from us, or who have contacted us via phone, postal mail, email, or our Web Contact Form located at **[www.charitywatch.org/contact](https://www.charitywatch.org/contact)**. We may use these names to process transactions and provide access to, or information about, CharityWatch's information and services, or for the purpose of contacting members, donors, and others about their online user accounts, membership information, tax receipts for  donations, renewal notices, donor alerts, and occasional fundraising efforts.

_**Email Addresses**_  
CharityWatch collects email addresses voluntarily provided to us by donors, members, visitors to our Web Site, and others who have requested information from us, or who have contacted us via phone, postal mail, email, or our Web Contact Form located at **[www.charitywatch.org/contact.](https://www.charitywatch.org/contact)** In accordance with our Terms of Use, CharityWatch members, journalists, and others who choose to create online accounts to gain access to restricted content on our Site are required to provide us with a current email address.

We may use the email addresses we have collected to communicate with CharityWatch members and others who have voluntarily provided their email addresses to us. Such communications are typically regarding online user accounts, membership information, tax receipts for online donations, renewal notices, donor alerts, and occasional fundraising efforts.

_**Mailing Addresses**_  
CharityWatch collects mailing addresses voluntarily provided to us by our donors and others in order to distribute the hard copy version of our publication, the _Charity Rating Guide & Watchdog Report_ (_Guide_)_._ We may also use these addresses to send tax receipts for offline donations; membership renewal reminders; and information related to CharityWatch news, announcements, and fundraising efforts. Donors making an online Membership contribution may opt-in to receive the hard copy _Guide_ during the check-out process on CharityWatch's Membership page located at **[www.charitywatch.org/join](https://www.charitywatch.org/join)**. Existing Members with current Memberships can opt-in to receive the hard copy _Guide_ when initially claiming their online accounts at **[www.charitywatch.org/claim](https://www.charitywatch.org/claim)**. Members who do not have reliable Internet access or who otherwise prefer to receive a hard copy _Guide_ are automatically opted-in to receiving the paper publication when they send in a Membership donation via paper check unless they otherwise communicate their desire to opt-out.

_**Credit Cards & Highly Sensitive Information**_  
CharityWatch does not store highly sensitive information, such as credit card data, from our visitors or donors. The portion of our Web Site on which credit card donations are processed is operated by a third-party transaction processor, PayPal, which takes measures to protect sensitive information using a variety of safeguards including encryption, firewalls, and other access controls.  
 

**Types of Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected & How It May Be Used**  
We may collect non-personally identifiable information from you when you visit and interact with our Web Site. This is information that is commonly collected by web site operators. CharityWatch uses this information, such as tracking the number of unique site visitors and the browsers and other technology they use to access our Web Site, in order to optimize the Site’s functionality and enhance user experience. This may include the proxy address of your Internet service provider (ISP) and your Internet protocol (IP) address; the query in the request; the version and name of your web browser; data related to sent or received cookies (described below); the uniform resource locator (URL) that was used to request access to our server; the pages accessed by users on our Site; and other commonly collected environmental variables.

_**Log Files**_  
Log files consist of information sent to our Web Site by Web Site visitors’ computers. Like many web site operators, our Web Site servers collect and store non-personally identifiable information from anyone who visits the CharityWatch.org Web Site. The data in these log files is used in aggregate to analyze site traffic, trends, and clicks, which enables us to administer and improve our Web Site. Data stored in log files may include information about site visitors’ IP addresses, browsers, ISPs, operating systems, standard web log data, and other information.

_**Cookies**_  
Cookies are pieces of numeric data stored on your computer. Many web sites, including CharityWatch.org, use them to identify a unique visitor returning to the web site. CharityWatch can only detect cookies placed on your computer by our own Web Site. Cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information. Web site users have the option of disabling cookies by adjusting their browser settings. Be aware, however, that disabling cookies may affect your ability to access certain portions of our Web Site. If this occurs, the problem can generally be remedied by re-enabling cookies and refreshing your browser.  
 

**Aggregated Data**  
Aggregated data is information we may gather and compile that is non-personally identifiable or linked to specific users of our Web Site. There are no restrictions under this Policy that restrict our right to aggregate this information, which we may share with third-parties and use in various ways, such as to understand the interests or popular content accessed by our Web Site visitors as a group.  
 

**User IDs & Passwords**  
CharityWatch members, journalists, and others who choose to create online accounts to gain access to restricted content on our Site have unique user IDs and passwords. The email address voluntarily provided to CharityWatch upon creation of an online account is the user ID, and users choose their own passwords.

Users should not share their passwords with third-parties, should not store their passwords on shared computers, and should always log out of their accounts when finished using our Web Site. Passwords are the property of private users, and in the interest of privacy and security CharityWatch will not disclose passwords to anyone. If a user forgets his or her password the user may reset the password using the online password reset function located at [**www.charitywatch.org/password/reset**](https://www.charitywatch.org/password/reset).  
 

**Information Security**  
_**Protection of Data from Loss**_  
CharityWatch has implemented physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information we receive from donors to CharityWatch and users of the CharityWatch Web Site. While no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, CharityWatch takes practical measures to safeguard the information of its Web Site users.

_**Information Sharing and Third-Party Usage**_  
CharityWatch respects the privacy of its donors and Site visitors, and is dedicated to protecting personal information entrusted with us. We do not share personal information—such as name, mailing address, telephone number, or email address—with anyone, except to the extent necessary to process transactions and provide access to, or information about, CharityWatch's information and services. CharityWatch does not disclose this information to third-parties for their marketing or fundraising purposes.

These third-parties may have their own privacy policies related to the information they collect from you, and we encourage users to read the privacy policies of any third-party web sites that they visit.   
 

**Use of Content**  
Information published by CharityWatch on its Web Site or in its hard copy _Guide_ is provided for general informational purposes only and is not intended, nor should it be construed, to be legal advice or a legal opinion. Reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the information contained in CharityWatch's _Guide_ and Web Site is as accurate as possible.
