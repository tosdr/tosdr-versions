3.1. Use of Services. Subject to all terms of this Agreement, including any Additional Terms, Podium grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license during the applicable Subscription Term and within the Territory (to the extent available in the Territory) to: (a) install and use an object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Services; and (b) access and use the Services, designated on Client’s Subscription Documentation solely for Client’s internal business purposes, but only in accordance with this Agreement, [Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) (“Acceptable Use Policy”), the applicable Subscription Documentation, and all applicable Scope of Use descriptions. Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials and must ensure that each Authorized User has a separate and distinct user account (with separate and distinct access credentials) that is not shared with any other user(s). Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data as necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein and in Podium's [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us) (the "Privacy Policy"), and hereby instructs Podium to do the same. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. This may include use of technologies (such as session replay services, transcription services, cookie, pixel, or other tracking technologies) that maintain records of browsing sessions and other activities on the Website and Services. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#baa) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#baa](https://legal.podium.com/#baa)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Podium may seek to recover all costs and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes and Other Governmental or Regulatory Fees. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Industry Fees and Surcharges. Your use of the Services may also be subject to certain industry-related fees or surcharges (such as fees imposed by telecommunications carriers or other over the top communications providers (for example, 10DLC-related fees)) (collectively, “Industry Fees”). Industry Fees may also include cost recovery fees representing a reasonable recovery of the charges, fees, and administrative expenses imposed on Podium and associated with the provision of the Services to you and your use of the Services. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of any such Industry Fees, and you will be required to pay any such Industry Fees related to your use of the Services. Where required by law, or at our own election, Podium will reflect such Industry Fees as a separate line on your invoice. Industry Fees may change at any time.

7.5. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees (other than Taxes, Industry Fees, or governmental/regulatory fees, which may change at any time) are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period other than for any suspension that: (a) is not due to the fault of the Client, and (b) lasts longer than five (5) days. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter) (or in the case of clients located in Australia, such party has a liquidator appointed or otherwise ceases to carry on business). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Suggestions (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Suggestions. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Suggestions”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Suggestions in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Suggestions or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client under Section 12.2(b) above, to the extent that the infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights arises from: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void. Additionally, Section 13.2 above does not apply to the extent Client is entitled to a right to rely under applicable Law.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) (or for clients located in Australia, the rules and procedures found in the Institute of Arbitrators and Mediators Australia Mediation Rules (“Rules”)) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA (or for clients located in Australia, the Rules) and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.1.2. Mediator Selection and Mediator Fees. A neutral mediator will be selected as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The mediator’s fees and costs will be paid to the mediator at the end of mediation, with both parties equally sharing the mediation costs and paying their own legal fees and costs.

15.1.3. Location. Mediation will occur in Salt Lake City, Utah, unless you are located in Australia, in which case mediation will occur in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

15.3.1. A request for an order of injunctive relief and any related incidental damages;

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign or purport to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party (which must not be unreasonably withheld), except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) (include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation. To avoid any doubt, Podium remains responsible for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement regardless of any subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.17.1. Australia Clients. If you are a Podium client located in Australia, this Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. To the extent permitted by law, the courts of Victoria, Australia, will be the exclusive jurisdiction for disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials and must ensure that each Authorized User has a separate and distinct user account (with separate and distinct access credentials) that is not shared with any other user(s). Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client.

Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. This may include use of technologies (such as session replay services, transcription services, cookie, pixel, or other tracking technologies) that maintain records of browsing sessions and other activities on the Website and Services. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#baa) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#baa](https://legal.podium.com/#baa)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers.

Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws.

If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Podium may seek to recover all costs and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes and Other Governmental or Regulatory Fees. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Industry Fees and Surcharges. Your use of the Services may also be subject to certain industry-related fees or surcharges (such as fees imposed by telecommunications carriers or other over the top communications providers (for example, 10DLC-related fees)) (collectively, “Industry Fees”). Industry Fees may also include cost recovery fees representing a reasonable recovery of the charges, fees, and administrative expenses imposed on Podium and associated with the provision of the Services to you and your use of the Services. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of any such Industry Fees, and you will be required to pay any such Industry Fees related to your use of the Services. Where required by law, or at our own election, Podium will reflect such Industry Fees as a separate line on your invoice. Industry Fees may change at any time.

7.5. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees (other than Taxes, Industry Fees, or governmental/regulatory fees, which may may change at any time) are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period other than for any suspension that: (a) is not due to the fault of the Client, and (b) lasts longer than five (5) days. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter) (or in the case of clients located in Australia, such party has a liquidator appointed or otherwise ceases to carry on business). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Suggestions (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Suggestions. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Suggestions”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Suggestions in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Suggestions or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client under Section 12.2(b) above, to the extent that the infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights arises from: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void. Additionally, Section 13.2 above does not apply to the extent Client is entitled to a right to rely under applicable Law.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client.

You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users.

Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors.

Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.17.1. Australia Clients. If you are a Podium client located in Australia, this Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia.

3. **USE RIGHTS; RESTRICTIONS.**

3.1. Use of Services. Subject to all terms of this Agreement, including any Additional Terms, Podium grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license during the applicable Subscription Term and within the Territory (to the extent available in the Territory) to: (a) install and use an object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Services; and (b) access and use the Services, designated on Client’s Subscription Documentation solely for Client’s internal business purposes, but only in accordance with this Agreement, [Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) (“Acceptable Use Policy”), the applicable Subscription Documentation, and all applicable Scope of Use descriptions. Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials and must ensure that each Authorized User has a separate and distinct user account (with separate and distinct access credentials) that is not shared with any other user(s). Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client.

Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. This may include use of technologies (such as session replay services, transcription services, cookie, pixel, or other tracking technologies) that maintain records of browsing sessions and other activities on the Website and Services. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#baa) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#baa](https://legal.podium.com/#baa)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Podium may seek to recover all costs and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes and Other Governmental or Regulatory Fees. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Industry Fees and Surcharges. Your use of the Services may also be subject to certain industry-related fees or surcharges (such as fees imposed by telecommunications carriers or other over the top communications providers (for example, 10DLC-related fees)) (collectively, “Industry Fees”). Industry Fees may also include cost recovery fees representing a reasonable recovery of the charges, fees, and administrative expenses imposed on Podium and associated with the provision of the Services to you and your use of the Services. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of any such Industry Fees, and you will be required to pay any such Industry Fees related to your use of the Services. Where required by law, or at our own election, Podium will reflect such Industry Fees as a separate line on your invoice. Industry Fees may change at any time.

7.5. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees (other than Taxes, Industry Fees, or governmental/regulatory fees, which may may change at any time) are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period other than for any suspension that: (a) is not due to the fault of the Client, and (b) lasts longer than five (5) days. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter) (or in the case of clients located in Australia, such party has a liquidator appointed or otherwise ceases to carry on business). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Suggestions (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Suggestions. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Suggestions”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Suggestions in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Suggestions or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client under Section 12.2(b) above, to the extent that the infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights arises from: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void. Additionally, Section 13.2 above does not apply to the extent Client is entitled to a right to rely under applicable Law.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

15.2. Judicial Action.

Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation.

16.9. Force Majeure.

Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument.

Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials and must ensure that each Authorized User has a separate and distinct user account (with separate and distinct access credentials) that is not shared with any other user(s). Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client.

Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. This may include use of technologies (such as session replay services, transcription services, cookie, pixel, or other tracking technologies) that maintain records of browsing sessions and other activities on the Website and Services. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Podium may seek to recover all costs and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes and Other Governmental or Regulatory Fees. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Industry Fees and Surcharges. Your use of the Services may also be subject to certain industry-related fees or surcharges (such as fees imposed by telecommunications carriers or other over the top communications providers (for example, 10DLC-related fees)) (collectively, “Industry Fees”). Industry Fees may also include cost recovery fees representing a reasonable recovery of the charges, fees, and administrative expenses imposed on Podium and associated with the provision of the Services to you and your use of the Services. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of any such Industry Fees, and you will be required to pay any such Industry Fees related to your use of the Services. Where required by law, or at our own election, Podium will reflect such Industry Fees as a separate line on your invoice. Industry Fees may change at any time.

7.5. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees (other than Taxes, Industry Fees, or governmental/regulatory fees, which may may change at any time) are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period other than for any suspension that: (a) is not due to the fault of the Client, and (b) lasts longer than five (5) days. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter) (or in the case of clients located in Australia, such party has a liquidator appointed or otherwise ceases to carry on business). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Suggestions (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Suggestions. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Suggestions”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Suggestions in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Suggestions or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data.

Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client under Section 12.2(b) above, to the extent that the infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights arises from: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void. Additionally, Section 13.2 above does not apply to the extent Client is entitled to a right to rely under applicable Law.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users.

Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors.

Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof.

Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials and must ensure that each Authorized User has a separate and distinct user account (with separate and distinct access credentials) that is not shared with any other user(s). Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client.

Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. This may include use of technologies (such as session replay services, transcription services, cookie, pixel, or other tracking technologies) that maintain records of browsing sessions and other activities on the Website and Services. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Podium may seek to recover all costs and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes and Other Governmental or Regulatory Fees. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Industry Fees and Surcharges. Your use of the Services may also be subject to certain industry-related fees or surcharges (such as fees imposed by telecommunications carriers or other over the top communications providers (for example, 10DLC-related fees)) (collectively, “Industry Fees”). Industry Fees may also include cost recovery fees representing a reasonable recovery of the charges, fees, and administrative expenses imposed on Podium and associated with the provision of the Services to you and your use of the Services. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of any such Industry Fees, and you will be required to pay any such Industry Fees related to your use of the Services. Where required by law, or at our own election, Podium will reflect such Industry Fees as a separate line on your invoice. Industry Fees may change at any time.

7.5. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees (other than Taxes, Industry Fees, or governmental/regulatory fees, which may may change at any time) are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period other than for any suspension that: (a) is not due to the fault of the Client, and (b) lasts longer than five (5) days. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter) (or in the case of clients located in Australia, such party has a liquidator appointed or otherwise ceases to carry on business). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Suggestions (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Suggestions. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Suggestions”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Suggestions in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Suggestions or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client under Section 12.2(b) above, to the extent that the infringement, misappropriation or, violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights arises from: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES).

13.2.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void. Additionally, Section 13.2 above does not apply to the extent Client is entitled to a right to rely under applicable Law.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US).

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation.

Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument.

Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client.

Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. This may include use of technologies (such as session replay services, transcription services, cookie, pixel, or other tracking technologies) that maintain records of browsing sessions and other activities on the Website and Services. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes and Other Governmental or Regulatory Fees. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Industry Fees and Surcharges. Your use of the Services may also be subject to certain industry-related fees or surcharges (such as fees imposed by telecommunications carriers or other over the top communications providers (for example, 10DLC-related fees)) (collectively, “Industry Fees”). Industry Fees may also include cost recovery fees representing a reasonable recovery of the charges, fees, and administrative expenses imposed on Podium and associated with the provision of the Services to you and your use of the Services. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of any such Industry Fees, and you will be required to pay any such Industry Fees related to your use of the Services. Where required by law, or at our own election, Podium will reflect such Industry Fees as a separate line on your invoice. Industry Fees may change at any time.

7.5. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees (other than Taxes, Industry Fees, or governmental/regulatory fees, which may may change at any time) are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Suggestions (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Suggestions. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Suggestions”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Suggestions in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Suggestions or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client.

Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users.

Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation. To avoid any doubt, Podium remains responsible for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement regardless of any subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.17.1. Australia Clients. If you are a Podium client located in Australia, this Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia.

Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data as necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein and in Podium's [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us) (the "Privacy Policy"), and hereby instructs Podium to do the same. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

  

15\. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation. To avoid any doubt, Podium remains responsible for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement regardless of any subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement.

It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.17.1. Australia Clients. If you are a Podium client located in Australia, this Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia.

Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete.

Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”).

Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data as necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein and in Podium's [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us) (the "Privacy Policy"), and hereby instructs Podium to do the same. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation. To avoid any doubt, Podium remains responsible for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement regardless of any subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.17.1. Australia Clients. If you are a Podium client located in Australia, this Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. To the extent permitted by law, the courts of Victoria, Australia, will be the exclusive jurisdiction for disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivative product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data as necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein and in Podium's [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us) (the "Privacy Policy"), and hereby instructs Podium to do the same. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

Neither party may assign or purport to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party (which must not be unreasonably withheld), except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the DPA, Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation. To avoid any doubt, Podium remains responsible for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement regardless of any subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes.

Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivate product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4.1. Rights in Client Data.

Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”).

Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers.

Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws.

Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

  

15\. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) (or for clients located in Australia, the rules and procedures found in the Institute of Arbitrators and Mediators Australia Mediation Rules (“Rules”)) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA (or for clients located in Australia, the Rules) and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.1.2. Mediator Selection and Mediator Fees. A neutral mediator will be selected as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The mediator’s fees and costs will be paid to the mediator at the end of mediation, with both parties equally sharing the mediation costs and paying their own legal fees and costs.

15.1.3. Location. Mediation will occur in Salt Lake City, Utah, unless you are located in Australia, in which case mediation will occur in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

15.3.1. A request for an order of injunctive relief and any related incidental damages;

15.3.2. A request for an order to prevent the disclosure of or misuse of Confidential Information or trade secrets; and/or

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign or purport to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party (which must not be unreasonably withheld), except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) (include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation. To avoid any doubt, Podium remains responsible for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement regardless of any subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.17.1. Australia Clients. If you are a Podium client located in Australia, this Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. To the extent permitted by law, the courts of Victoria, Australia, will be the exclusive jurisdiction for disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.

16.19. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.19 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device. You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Podium only, not with Apple Inc. (“Apple”), and Apple is not responsible for the Services or the content thereof.

Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the Services and/or your possession and use of the Services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivate product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions.

This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client.

Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s [Data Processing Addendum](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa) (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#dpa](https://legal.podium.com/#dpa)), governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

15.2. Judicial Action.

Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client.

You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users.

Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof.

Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. If Client attempts to access or use the Services outside of the Territory, Client does so at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with all Laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s) not directly caused by Podium's actions or omissions.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services, as set forth in Section 8.2 below. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivate product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data as necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein and in Podium's [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us) (the "Privacy Policy"), and hereby instructs Podium to do the same. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s Data Processing Addendum (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US).

IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement.

Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes.

Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service, except as otherwise expressly authorized by Podium in writing; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof or access the services with the intent to copy or create a competitive or derivate product/service; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Release(s)”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release; though Podium may use good faith efforts, in its discretion, to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make them generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time and with reasonable notice for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, "Client Data" also includes PHI. “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data as necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein and in Podium's [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us) (the "Privacy Policy"), and hereby instructs Podium to do the same. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Customer Data as necessary to provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and as otherwise set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Additionally, Client understands and agrees that following termination, Podium may delete all Client Data in its possession. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

4.6. Privacy and Data Processing. The Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us or we otherwise collect when you and your Customers use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including, as applicable, the transfer of this information to the United States and other countries for storage, processing, and use by Podium and its affiliates. Additionally, to the extent applicable, the parties agree that Podium’s Data Processing Addendum (“Data Processing Addendum” or “DPA”) governs in the event Podium Processes any Covered Data as Client’s Processor or Service Provider (as those terms are defined in the DPA) in connection with this Agreement.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, regulation, or other third-party rights; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to communicate electronically only with Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with all necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use the Services to make or send communication only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement (including the Acceptable Use Policy) and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used for transactional and/or informational communications. If Client uses the Services to make or send any written electronic communication (including but not limited text messages) that includes advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messaging, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), Client must, in each instance, clearly designate such message(s) as “Marketing” within the Service prior to sending. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on Client's Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions of the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance (though overage fees, if any, may be charged in arrears), and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on Client's Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client acknowledges and authorizes Podium to charge Fees and other amounts automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. Podium may from time to time provide notice to Client regarding any Renewal Term(s) and the auto-renew processes. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations, including through the use of third-party services. If Podium sends Client’s account for collection and/or initiates legal action to collect overdue amounts, Client will be liable for all cost and expenses of such action, including reasonable legal or attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, regulatory fees, or levies and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies (which for clients located in Australia, includes any applicable goods and services taxes as set out in a New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)), whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Service(s). While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term (if Client has not elected to opt out of the automatic renewal or renegotiate the Fees). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 (Term) or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA or other obligation under applicable Law, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party (where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) provided by Podium (collectively, "Podium Technology") (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as defined in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for Third-Party Providers and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors'' under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, any breach or alleged breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

13.3. For Clients Located in Australia Only. Neither this Section 13 (Disclaimers) nor Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) below excludes, restricts, or modifies the application of any provision of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) (whether applicable as a law of the Commonwealth, or any state or territory of Australia), the exercise of any right to remedy conferred by the ACL, or the liability of Podium for a failure to comply with any applicable consumer guarantees where to do so would contravene the ACL or cause any part of these sections to be void.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

14.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

14.2. FOR CLIENTS LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA ONLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS SECTION 14, AND WHERE THE ACL APPLIES, PODIUM’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED AT THE OPTION OF PODIUM TO (A) IN THE CASE OF ANY PRODUCT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING (i) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR THE SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, (ii) THE REPAIR OF THE PRODUCT, (iii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF REPLACING THE PRODUCT OR OF ACQUIRING EQUIVALENT PRODUCT, OR (iv) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THE PRODUCT REQUIRED, IF APPLICABLE; AND (B) IN THE CASE OF ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES OR RELATED SERVICES PERFORMED BY PODIUM: (i) THE SUPPLY OF THOSE SERVICES AGAIN, OR (ii) THE PAYMENT OF THE COST OF HAVING THOSE SERVICES APPLIED AGAIN.

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) (or for clients located in Australia, the rules and procedures found in the Institute of Arbitrators and Mediators Australia Mediation Rules (“Rules”)) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA (or for clients located in Australia, the Rules) and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.1.2. Mediator Selection and Mediator Fees. A neutral mediator will be selected as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The mediator’s fees and costs will be paid to the mediator at the end of mediation, with both parties equally sharing the mediation costs and paying their own legal fees and costs.

15.1.3. Location. Mediation will occur in Salt Lake City, Utah, unless you are located in Australia, in which case mediation will occur in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

15.3.1. A request for an order of injunctive relief and any related incidental damages;

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign or purport to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party (which must not be unreasonably withheld), except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) (include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Program Terms (“Referral Program Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Podium will not be required to obtain Client’s consent or provide notice of such subcontracting or delegation. To avoid any doubt, Podium remains responsible for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement regardless of any subcontracting or delegation.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by giving reasonable notice and posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services, except where applicable Law requires different treatment. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification, supplementation, replacement, novation or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete restatement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.17.1. Australia Clients. If you are a Podium client located in Australia, this Agreement is governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. To the extent permitted by law, the courts of Victoria, Australia, will be the exclusive jurisdiction for disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

Although the Services may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and will be governed by Podium’s Privacy Policy as may be amended from time to time. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. By using or accessing the Website, Client agrees and consents to Podium’s use of cookies in accordance with the terms of Podium’s Privacy Policy. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s).

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Releases”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws.

Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right. Podium will not be held liable for any consequences of false and/or inaccurate content published to an online review or ratings website through Podium by Client or its Authorized Users.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services.

Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes and regulatory fees, and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Services. While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“Podium Technology”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for these providers and items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors” under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.18. Notice to California Residents. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.

16.19. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.19 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device.

You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Although the Services may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and will be governed by Podium’s Privacy Policy as may be amended from time to time. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. By using or accessing the Website, Client agrees and consents to Podium’s use of cookies in accordance with the terms of Podium’s Privacy Policy. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s).

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Releases”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, or regulation; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right. Podium will not be held liable for any consequences of false and/or inaccurate content published to an online review or ratings website through Podium by Client or its Authorized Users.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to send electronic communication, including but not limited to text messages, only to Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used to send transactional and/or informational messages, not advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), and that Client may use the Services to send Marketing messages only via Podium Campaigns. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) send Marketing messages through Podium only via Podium Campaigns and only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”).

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes and regulatory fees, and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Services. While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“Podium Technology”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for these providers and items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS.

(Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.2. Judicial Action.

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) (include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Submission Terms (“Referral Submission Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors” under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.18. Notice to California Residents. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the Services or to receive further information regarding use of the Services.

16.19. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.19 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device.

Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the Services and/or your possession and use of the Services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client.

This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release.

WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, or regulation; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers.

Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right.

Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used to send transactional and/or informational messages, not advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), and that Client may use the Services to send Marketing messages only via Podium Campaigns. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) send Marketing messages through Podium only via Podium Campaigns and only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes and regulatory fees, and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Services. While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“Podium Technology”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for these providers and items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Service Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  

15\. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.1.2. Mediator Selection and Mediator Fees. A neutral mediator will be selected as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The mediator’s fees and costs will be paid to the mediator at the end of mediation, with both parties equally sharing the mediation costs and paying their own legal fees and costs.

15.1.3. Location. Mediation will occur in Salt Lake City, Utah.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

15.3.1. A request for an order of injunctive relief and any related incidental damages;

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) (include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Submission Terms (“Referral Submission Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors” under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.18. Notice to California Residents. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the Services or to receive further information regarding use of the Services.

16.19. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.19 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device.

Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Services. If the Services fail to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the Services. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Services or your possession and/or use of the Services, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Services fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; or (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the Services and/or your possession and use of the Services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Releases”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “Third-Party Content” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s [BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#BAA](https://legal.podium.com/#BAA)), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section 4.4.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it will use the Services in full compliance with all Laws and terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and that it will not use the Services in a manner that would cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such Laws. Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, or regulation; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s Authorized User(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Data or Client’s CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right. Podium will not be held liable for any consequences of false and/or inaccurate content published to an online review or ratings website through Podium by Client or its Authorized Users.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to send electronic communication, including but not limited to text messages, only to Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with necessary notices in accordance with applicable Laws. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used to send transactional and/or informational messages, not advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), and that Client may use the Services to send Marketing messages only via Podium Campaigns. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) send Marketing messages through Podium only via Podium Campaigns and only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy, and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable Laws and the Acceptable Use Policy and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the Acceptable Use Policy, and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes and regulatory fees, and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Services. While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“Podium Technology”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “Feedback”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for these providers and items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “Podium Entities”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services, including but not limited to the Podium Marketplace and Podium API, as applicable; (b) your violation of, any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your Customers, any Developer Partners, and any Third-Party Service Providers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; or (h) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, Developer Partners, Third-Party Providers, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  

15\. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.1.2. Mediator Selection and Mediator Fees. A neutral mediator will be selected as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The mediator’s fees and costs will be paid to the mediator at the end of mediation, with both parties equally sharing the mediation costs and paying their own legal fees and costs.

15.1.3. Location. Mediation will occur in Salt Lake City, Utah.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

15.3.1. A request for an order of injunctive relief and any related incidental damages;

15.3.2. A request for an order to prevent the disclosure of or misuse of Confidential Information or trade secrets; and/or

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) (include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line) or by email to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Podium Communication with Client. You agree that Podium may send you emails and text messages, including transactional, operational, and marketing messages, possibly using automated technology, to the email or phone number you provide to Podium. Message and/or data rates may apply to such messages, and you may opt out at any time. You will keep your contact information up to date and will notify Podium immediately in the event that your contact information changes.

16.5. Referral Programs. Podium may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, offer referral programs or opportunities to certain Podium clients or users. Such programs or opportunities may include incentives for such clients or users to promote Podium and/or its Services to their family or friends. Participation in such programs or opportunities is completely voluntary and is subject to this Agreement and the Podium Referral Submission Terms (“Referral Submission Terms”). Podium may modify, discontinue, or terminate any referral program or similar opportunity at any time, without notice.

16.6. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement. Unless Podium expressly states otherwise in signed writing, Third-Party Providers are not “subcontractors” under this Agreement, and Podium disclaims all responsibility and liability for the actions or omissions of any Third-Party Providers, including but not limited to Developers.

16.7. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.9. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.10. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.18. Notice to California Residents. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.

16.19. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.19 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device.

Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Services. If the Services fail to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the Services. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Services or your possession and/or use of the Services, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Services fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; or (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the Services and/or your possession and use of the Services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Although the Services may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal, is prohibited under this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client must register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and will be governed by Podium’s Privacy Policy as may be amended from time to time.

By using or accessing the Website, Client agrees and consents to Podium’s use of cookies in accordance with the terms of Podium’s Privacy Policy. Client is solely responsible for all use of its Services account(s). Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account(s).

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees, agents, contractors, and any other users (including but not limited to Developer Partners or Third-Party Providers) whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“Authorized Users”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all Laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with this Agreement. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“Customer(s)”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s account or website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable Law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscription”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Releases”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section 3.7 and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Free Access Subscriptions and Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Free Access Subscription or Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“Client Data”). “Customer Data” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services.

Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable Laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website or Services; to improve Client’s experience using the Website or Services; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website or Services more helpful or useful to Client and other users. Client also understands that any third-party platform(s) or Third-Party Provider(s) Client elects to use or access in conjunction with the Services may also monitor and analyze the Client Data and/or Customer Data Client uses or accesses in connection with such third-party platforms, to customize and communicate information or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with applicable terms of use; and to make such third-party platform(s) more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies, if any. Client is primarily responsible for its own account setup and onboarding. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement, including via Third-Party Providers or subcontractors. If applicable, the scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“Subscription”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “Fees”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription Term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts equal to the maximum amounts allowed by applicable Law. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes and regulatory fees, and Client must pay any applicable taxes regulatory fees, or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax and regulatory fee payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to determine the applicable Fees for any Services. While Podium will make reasonable efforts to keep the information relating to Fees published on its Website up to date, you should check the Website periodically for information about current Fees. If any Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, Podium may increase Fees applicable to you upon forty-five (45) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms. Podium may also, from time to time and in its sole discretion, make promotional offers or different Fees available to its clients or other users. Such promotional offers will not apply to you or this Agreement unless specified in writing in your Subscription Documentation.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “Subscription Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to [support@podium.com](mailto:support@podium.com). If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“Subscription Start Date”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1 or Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause). Unless Client’s Subscription Documentation expressly states otherwise, any additional Services purchased during Client’s Subscription Term will be coterminous with Client’s most recent Podium platform Subscription Term.

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s (or any Authorized User’s, as applicable) access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control; and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Providers and Third-Party Products); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Products and Integrations); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or Authorized Users having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.6), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party where permitted to do so) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“Podium Technology”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services.

Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with a third party to facilitate certain features of the Services, including as described in Section 16.6 of this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement (“Third-Party Provider(s)”). If Client elects to use any Third-Party Provider(s) or any applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“Third-Party Products”) in connection with the Services, such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Provider(s) or Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Unless Podium expressly agrees otherwise in a signed writing, Podium (a) is not a party to any such terms; (b) will not be liable thereunder; (c) does not warrant or support Third-Party Providers, Third-Party Products; or Third-Party Content; and (d) disclaims all responsibility and liability for these providers and items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data.

In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights.

Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section 16.10, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.11. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.12. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.13. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.14. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

16.16. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.18. Notice to California Residents. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the Services or to receive further information regarding use of the Services.

16.19. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.19 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device.

If the Services fail to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the Services. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Services or your possession and/or use of the Services, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Services fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; or (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

If you are using a Podium Service on behalf of a company or other entity, then “Client” or “you” means that entity, and you are binding that entity to this Agreement. You represent and warrant that you have the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that, if the Client is an entity, this Agreement is entered into by an employee or agent with all necessary authority to bind that entity to this Agreement.

This Agreement includes and hereby incorporates by reference any Subscription Documentation executed between you and Podium, as well as any policies or exhibits linked to or referenced herein. **If you have entered into a separate written agreement with Podium concerning specific Services, the terms of such agreement control if there is any conflict between the terms of such agreement and these Terms.** Please note that we may modify this Agreement as described in Section 16.8 below.

2. **SERVICES.**

2.1. Services. Podium provides a proprietary multi-product platform that includes without limitation reputation management tools (“**Reviews**” and “**Feedback**”), messaging and communication tools (“**Inbox**,” “**Webchat**,” “**Videochat**,” “**Teamchat**,” “**Automations**,” **“Voice,”** and “**Campaigns**”), payment processing (“**Payments**”), certain Free Access Subscription or Beta Releases (as defined below), and any other services Podium may offer from time to time (together with the Website, the “**Service(s)**”). Client will, from time to time, enter into a proposal, quote, services/purchase agreement, order form, statement of work, or otherwise click to accept or agree to an online registration form, which references this Agreement (“**Subscription Documentation**”) and details the Services ordered from Podium and, if applicable, the usage limits or other scope of use descriptions for the Services (including without limitation any usage or volume limits, numerical limits on Authorized Users, and descriptions of product feature levels) (the “**Scope of Use**”). Client may be provided the option to purchase certain Services as part of a package or bundle offer (each, a “**Bundle**”), as detailed in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium has no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in this Agreement, including any applicable Subscription Documentation.

2.2. Alteration of Subscription Documentation. Any amendments or modification to any existing Subscription Documentation must be agreed to in writing by the parties. Podium has no obligation to perform any Services under the amended Subscription Documentation until the parties have agreed to the effect of such changes on the applicable Fees.

2.3. Modification of the Services. Podium reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Services at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Services), or to alter the offering of the Services (including by adding, limiting, or discontinuing certain Bundle offers) temporarily or permanently. Podium also reserves the right to replace certain Services and Bundles with functionally equivalent Services or Bundles, at its sole discretion. In the event Podium makes any modification or alteration to the Services or the offering thereof that has a material adverse effect on the functionality of the Services ordered under your Subscription Documentation, Client may terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rated refund of pre-paid unused Fees for the remainder of Client’s Subscription Term (as defined below).

2.4. Additional Terms. Client’s subscription to or use of certain Services may be subject to additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Services or certain features of the Services that we may post on or link to from the Services (the “**Additional Terms**”). For example, if you elect to use Podium Payments, your use is subject to the Podium Payments Service Terms (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#paymentstos-us](https://legal.podium.com/#paymentstos-us)). To the extent applicable, all Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.

  

3. **USE RIGHTS; RESTRICTIONS.**

3.1. Use of Services. Subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any Additional Terms, Podium grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license during the applicable Subscription Term and within the Territory (to the extent available in the Territory) to: (a) install and use an object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Services; and (b) access and use the Services, designated on Client’s Subscription Documentation solely for Client’s internal business purposes, but only in accordance with this Agreement, Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), the applicable Subscription Documentation, and all applicable Scope of Use descriptions. Although the Services may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client will register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and will be governed by Podium’s Privacy Policy (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us)) as may be amended from time to time. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. By using or accessing the Website, Client agrees and consents to Podium’s use of cookies in accordance with the terms of Podium’s Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for all use of the Services account. Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees and contractors whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“**Authorized Users**”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all applicable laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with the terms and conditions herein. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“**Customer(s)**”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “**Free Access Subscription**”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“**Beta Releases**”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Releases. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“**Client Data**”). “**Customer Data**” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “**Third-Party Content**” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“**Aggregate/Anonymous Data**”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium, and any third-party platform(s) Client uses or accesses in connection with the Services, may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to improve Client’s experience using the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website, Services, or third-party platform more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s BAA (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement](https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement)/), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it is in full compliance with all applicable state, federal, and international laws, rules, and regulations and that Client will not use the Services in a manner that would violate or cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such laws, rules, or regulations, or amendments thereto, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the CAN-SPAM Act, Do Not Call rules and prohibitions, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”). Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, or regulation; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Information or CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right. Podium will not be held liable for any consequences of false and/or inaccurate content published to an online review or ratings website through Podium by Client or its Authorized Users.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to send electronic communication, including but not limited to text messages, only to Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with necessary notices in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used to send transactional and/or informational messages, not advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable laws, rules, and regulations (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), and that Client may use the Services to send Marketing messages only via Podium Campaigns. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) send Marketing messages through Podium only via Podium Campaigns and only in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws, regulations and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable law and regulations and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable law or regulation and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement. The scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“**Subscription**”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“**Subscription Fees**”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “**Fees**”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts at the annual rate of 12%, compounded monthly, or the maximum lawful amounts, whichever is less. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Client must pay any applicable taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to increase Fees for any Services, upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “**Subscription Term**”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to support@podium.com. If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“**Subscription Start Date**”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause).

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Products and Integrations); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.4), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“**Podium Technology**”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an on-line, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “**Feedback**”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with third-party service providers to facilitate certain features of the Services, as described in this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement. If Client elects to use applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“**Third-Party Products**”) in connection with the Services, those products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Podium is not a party to any such terms and will not be liable thereunder. Podium does not warrant or support Third-Party Products or Third-Party Content and disclaims all responsibility and liability for these items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “**Podium Entities**”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services; (b) your violation of any applicable law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including your Customers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; (h) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that you have violated any law, rule, or regulation; or, (i) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGE, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  

15\. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.1.2. Mediator Selection and Mediator Fees. A neutral mediator will be selected as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The mediator’s fees and costs will be paid to the mediator at the end of mediation, with both parties equally sharing the mediation costs and paying their own legal fees and costs.

15.1.3. Location. Mediation will occur in Salt Lake City, Utah.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

15.3.1. A request for an order of injunctive relief and any related incidental damages;

15.3.2. A request for an order to prevent the disclosure of or misuse of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets; and/or

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement.

16.5. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.6. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.7. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.8. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.9. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.11. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.12. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only, and have no legal effect.

16.14. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.15. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.16. Notice to California Residents. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the Services or to receive further information regarding use of the Services.

16.17. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.17 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device. You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Podium only, not with Apple Inc. (“**Apple**”), and Apple is not responsible for the Services or the content thereof. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Services. If the Services fail to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the Services. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Services or your possession and/or use of the Services, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Services fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; or (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the Services and/or your possession and use of the Services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

(“**Podium**”, “**we**” or “**us**”). By using, installing, or accessing the Website or Services (as defined below), by signing or clicking to accept these terms or any Subscription Documentation (as defined below) referencing these terms, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions including Podium’s Privacy Policy (together, these “**Terms**”, or this “**Agreement**”).

If you are using a Podium Service on behalf of a company or other entity, then “Client” or “you” means that entity, and you are binding that entity to this Agreement. You represent and warrant that you have the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that, if the Client is an entity, this Agreement is entered into by an employee or agent with all necessary authority to bind that entity to this Agreement.

This Agreement includes and hereby incorporates by reference any Subscription Documentation executed between you and Podium, as well as any policies or exhibits linked to or referenced herein. **If you have entered into a separate written agreement with Podium concerning specific Services, the terms of such agreement control if there is any conflict between the terms of such agreement and these Terms.** Please note that we may modify this Agreement as described in Section 16.8 below.

1. **DEFINITIONS.**

Client may be provided the option to purchase certain Services as part of a package or bundle offer (each, a “**Bundle**”), as detailed in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium has no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in this Agreement, including any applicable Subscription Documentation.

2.2. Alteration of Subscription Documentation. Any amendments or modification to any existing Subscription Documentation must be agreed to in writing by the parties. Podium has no obligation to perform any Services under the amended Subscription Documentation until the parties have agreed to the effect of such changes on the applicable Fees.

2.3. Modification of the Services. Podium reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Services at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Services), or to alter the offering of the Services (including by adding, limiting, or discontinuing certain Bundle offers) temporarily or permanently. Podium also reserves the right to replace certain Services and Bundles with functionally equivalent Services or Bundles, at its sole discretion. In the event Podium makes any modification or alteration to the Services or the offering thereof that has a material adverse effect on the functionality of the Services ordered under your Subscription Documentation, Client may terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rated refund of pre-paid unused Fees for the remainder of Client’s Subscription Term (as defined below).

To the extent applicable, all Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.

  

3. **USE RIGHTS; RESTRICTIONS.**

3.1. Use of Services. Subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any Additional Terms, Podium grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license during the applicable Subscription Term and within the Territory (to the extent available in the Territory) to: (a) install and use an object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Services; and (b) access and use the Services, designated on Client’s Subscription Documentation solely for Client’s internal business purposes, but only in accordance with this Agreement, Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/acceptable-use-policy/](https://www.podium.com/acceptable-use-policy/)), the applicable Subscription Documentation, and all applicable Scope of Use descriptions. Although the Services may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client will register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and will be governed by Podium’s Privacy Policy (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/privacypolicy](https://www.podium.com/privacypolicy)) as may be amended from time to time. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. By using or accessing the Website, Client agrees and consents to Podium’s use of cookies in accordance with the terms of Podium’s Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for all use of the Services account. Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees and contractors whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“**Authorized Users**”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all applicable laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with the terms and conditions herein. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“**Customer(s)**”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “**Free Access Subscription**”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“**Beta Releases**”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Releases. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“**Client Data**”). “**Customer Data**” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “**Third-Party Content**” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“**Aggregate/Anonymous Data**”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium, and any third-party platform(s) Client uses or accesses in connection with the Services, may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to improve Client’s experience using the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website, Services, or third-party platform more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s BAA (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement](https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement)/), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it is in full compliance with all applicable state, federal, and international laws, rules, and regulations and that Client will not use the Services in a manner that would violate or cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such laws, rules, or regulations, or amendments thereto, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the CAN-SPAM Act, Do Not Call rules and prohibitions, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”). Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, or regulation; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Information or CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right. Podium will not be held liable for any consequences of false and/or inaccurate content published to an online review or ratings website through Podium by Client or its Authorized Users.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to send electronic communication, including but not limited to text messages, only to Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with necessary notices in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used to send transactional and/or informational messages, not advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable laws, rules, and regulations (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), and that Client may use the Services to send Marketing messages only via Podium Campaigns. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) send Marketing messages through Podium only via Podium Campaigns and only in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws, regulations and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable law and regulations and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable law or regulation and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement. The scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“**Subscription**”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“**Subscription Fees**”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “**Fees**”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts at the annual rate of 12%, compounded monthly, or the maximum lawful amounts, whichever is less. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Client must pay any applicable taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to increase Fees for any Services, upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “**Subscription Term**”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to support@podium.com. If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“**Subscription Start Date**”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause).

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Products and Integrations); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.4), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“**Podium Technology**”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an on-line, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “**Feedback**”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with third-party service providers to facilitate certain features of the Services, as described in this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement. If Client elects to use applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“**Third-Party Products**”) in connection with the Services, those products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Podium is not a party to any such terms and will not be liable thereunder. Podium does not warrant or support Third-Party Products or Third-Party Content and disclaims all responsibility and liability for these items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “**Podium Entities**”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services; (b) your violation of any applicable law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including your Customers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; (h) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that you have violated any law, rule, or regulation; or, (i) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGE, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  

15\. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.1.1. Notice. Mediation must be conducted within sixty (60) days from a party receiving written notice of Claims from a complaining party. The notice must contain a detailed description of the nature of the Claims and the requested relief sought.

15.1.3. Location. Mediation will occur in Salt Lake City, Utah.

15.2. Judicial Action. If the parties are unable to resolve the Claim pursuant to the mandatory mediation referenced above (or if one of the parties refuses to participate in the mandatory mediation or fails to respond to a complaining party’s request for mediation), the parties may subsequently file a judicial action.

15.3. Disputes Not Subject to the Mediation Process. The following claims or actions are not subject to the mandatory mediation provisions of this Section 15:

15.3.1. A request for an order of injunctive relief and any related incidental damages;

15.3.2. A request for an order to prevent the disclosure of or misuse of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets; and/or

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement.

16.5. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.6. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.7. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.8. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.9. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.11. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.12. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only, and have no legal effect.

16.14. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.15. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

16.16. Notice to California Residents. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.

16.17. Notice Regarding Apple. This Section 16.17 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application on an iOS device.

Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Services. If the Services fail to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the Services.

You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Services. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

Podium.com ([https://www.podium.com](https://www.podium.com/)), including all of its related applications, dashboards, or platforms (individually and collectively, the “**Website**”), is owned and operated by Podium Corporation, Inc. (“**Podium**”, “**we**” or “**us**”). By using, installing, or accessing the Website or Services (as defined below), by signing or clicking to accept these terms or any Subscription Documentation (as defined below) referencing these terms, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions including Podium’s Privacy Policy (together, these “**Terms**”, or this “**Agreement**”).

If you are using a Podium Service on behalf of a company or other entity, then “Client” or “you” means that entity, and you are binding that entity to this Agreement. You represent and warrant that you have the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that, if the Client is an entity, this Agreement is entered into by an employee or agent with all necessary authority to bind that entity to this Agreement.

This Agreement includes and hereby incorporates by reference any Subscription Documentation executed between you and Podium, as well as any policies or exhibits linked to or referenced herein. **If you have entered into a separate written agreement with Podium concerning specific Services, the terms of such agreement control if there is any conflict between the terms of such agreement and these Terms.** Please note that we may modify this Agreement as described in Section 16.8 below.

1. **DEFINITIONS.**

1.1. “**Business Associate Agreement**” (hereinafter “**BAA**”) means a written agreement between a covered entity and a business associate containing the elements specified at 45 CFR 164.504(e).

1.2. “**Confidential Information**” means code, inventions, know-how, product plans, technical and financial, business, operational, or other information exchanged under this Agreement or learned during the performance of this Agreement, or that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should reasonably be considered confidential based on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information disclosed.

1.3. “**HIPAA**” means the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “**HITECH Act**”), the Administrative Simplification section of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as codified at 42 U.S.C. §1320d through d-8, as amended from time to time, and the requirements of any regulations promulgated under either the HITECH Act or HIPAA, including, without limitation, the federal privacy regulations as contained in 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164, the federal security standards as contained in 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 162, and the federal standards for electronic transactions contained in 45 C.F.R. Parts 160, all as may be amended from time to time.

1.4. “**Protected Health Information**” (hereinafter “**PHI**”) has the same meaning as that term is defined in HIPAA.

1.5. “**Territory**” means the United States, Canada, and Australia, unless otherwise expressly set forth in Client’s Subscription Documentation.

  

Other terms are defined in other Sections of this Agreement.

2. **SERVICES.**

2.1. Services. Podium provides a proprietary multi-product platform that includes without limitation reputation management tools (“**Reviews**” and “**Feedback**”), messaging and communication tools (“**Inbox**,” “**Webchat**,” “**Videochat**,” “**Teamchat**,” “**Automations**,” **“Voice,”** and “**Campaigns**”), payment processing (“**Payments**”), certain Free Access Subscription or Beta Releases (as defined below), and any other services Podium may offer from time to time (together with the Website, the “**Service(s)**”). Client will, from time to time, enter into a proposal, quote, services/purchase agreement, order form, statement of work, or otherwise click to accept or agree to an online registration form, which references this Agreement (“**Subscription Documentation**”) and details the Services ordered from Podium and, if applicable, the usage limits or other scope of use descriptions for the Services (including without limitation any usage or volume limits, numerical limits on Authorized Users, and descriptions of product feature levels) (the “**Scope of Use**”). Client may be provided the option to purchase certain Services as part of a package or bundle offer (each, a “**Bundle**”), as detailed in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium has no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in this Agreement, including any applicable Subscription Documentation.

2.2. Alteration of Subscription Documentation. Any amendments or modification to any existing Subscription Documentation must be agreed to in writing by the parties. Podium has no obligation to perform any Services under the amended Subscription Documentation until the parties have agreed to the effect of such changes on the applicable Fees.

2.3. Modification of the Services. Podium reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Services at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Services), or to alter the offering of the Services (including by adding, limiting, or discontinuing certain Bundle offers) temporarily or permanently. Podium also reserves the right to replace certain Services and Bundles with functionally equivalent Services or Bundles, at its sole discretion. In the event Podium makes any modification or alteration to the Services or the offering thereof that has a material adverse effect on the functionality of the Services ordered under your Subscription Documentation, Client may terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rated refund of pre-paid unused Fees for the remainder of Client’s Subscription Term (as defined below).

2.4. Additional Terms. Client’s subscription to or use of certain Services may be subject to additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Services or certain features of the Services that we may post on or link to from the Services (the “**Additional Terms**”). For example, if you elect to use Podium Payments, your use is subject to the Podium Payments Service Terms (currently available at https://www.podium.com/payments-terms-and-conditions/). To the extent applicable, all Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.

  

3. **USE RIGHTS; RESTRICTIONS.**

3.1. Use of Services. Subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any Additional Terms, Podium grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license during the applicable Subscription Term and within the Territory (to the extent available in the Territory) to: (a) install and use an object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Services; and (b) access and use the Services, designated on Client’s Subscription Documentation solely for Client’s internal business purposes, but only in accordance with this Agreement, Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/acceptable-use-policy/](https://www.podium.com/acceptable-use-policy/)), the applicable Subscription Documentation, and all applicable Scope of Use descriptions. Although the Services may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client will register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and will be governed by Podium’s Privacy Policy (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/privacypolicy](https://www.podium.com/privacypolicy)) as may be amended from time to time. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. By using or accessing the Website, Client agrees and consents to Podium’s use of cookies in accordance with the terms of Podium’s Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for all use of the Services account. Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees and contractors whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“**Authorized Users**”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all applicable laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with the terms and conditions herein. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“**Customer(s)**”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “**Free Access Subscription**”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“**Beta Releases**”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Releases. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“**Client Data**”). “**Customer Data**” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “**Third-Party Content**” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“**Aggregate/Anonymous Data**”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium, and any third-party platform(s) Client uses or accesses in connection with the Services, may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to improve Client’s experience using the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website, Services, or third-party platform more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s BAA (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement](https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement)/), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it is in full compliance with all applicable state, federal, and international laws, rules, and regulations and that Client will not use the Services in a manner that would violate or cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such laws, rules, or regulations, or amendments thereto, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the CAN-SPAM Act, Do Not Call rules and prohibitions, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”). Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, or regulation; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Information or CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right. Podium will not be held liable for any consequences of false and/or inaccurate content published to an online review or ratings website through Podium by Client or its Authorized Users.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to send electronic communication, including but not limited to text messages, only to Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with necessary notices in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used to send transactional and/or informational messages, not advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable laws, rules, and regulations (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), and that Client may use the Services to send Marketing messages only via Podium Campaigns. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) send Marketing messages through Podium only via Podium Campaigns and only in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws, regulations and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable law and regulations and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable law or regulation and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement. The scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“**Subscription**”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“**Subscription Fees**”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “**Fees**”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts at the annual rate of 12%, compounded monthly, or the maximum lawful amounts, whichever is less. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Client must pay any applicable taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to increase Fees for any Services, upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “**Subscription Term**”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to support@podium.com. If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“**Subscription Start Date**”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause).

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Products and Integrations); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.4), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“**Podium Technology**”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an on-line, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “**Feedback**”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with third-party service providers to facilitate certain features of the Services, as described in this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement. If Client elects to use applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“**Third-Party Products**”) in connection with the Services, those products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Podium is not a party to any such terms and will not be liable thereunder. Podium does not warrant or support Third-Party Products or Third-Party Content and disclaims all responsibility and liability for these items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “**Podium Entities**”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services; (b) your violation of any applicable law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including your Customers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; (h) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that you have violated any law, rule, or regulation; or, (i) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. PODIUM MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL MEET CLIENT’S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, THAT CLIENT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS, OR THAT PODIUM TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR-FREE, AND PODIUM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES). THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGE, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY, OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

  

15\. **DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

If a dispute arises between the parties related to this Agreement or the Services provided therefrom, and the dispute cannot be settled through informal negotiations, the parties agree to resolve their dispute (referred to herein as “Claim(s)”) as follows:

15.1. Mediation. The parties agree to participate in mediation to settle their Claims in accordance with the rules and procedures found in Utah Code § 78B-10-101 et seq. (Utah Uniform Mediation Act and referred to as “UUMA”) and this Agreement before a party can file a judicial action, whether in a court of law, an administrative body, government agency, or otherwise. If there are any conflicting provisions between UUMA and this Agreement, the provisions in this Agreement will govern.

15.3.3. Enforcement of Client’s payment obligations as set forth under Section 7.

  

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement.

16.5. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.6. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.7. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.8. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.9. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.11. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

16.12. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for the action.

16.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including these Terms and any applicable Subscription Documentation, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only, and have no legal effect.

16.14. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes.

Last Updated: March 4, 2022

Podium.com ([https://www.podium.com](https://www.podium.com/)), including all of its related applications, dashboards, or platforms (individually and collectively, the “**Website**”), is owned and operated by Podium Corporation, Inc. (“**Podium**”, “**we**” or “**us**”). By using, installing, or accessing the Website or Services (as defined below), by signing or clicking to accept these terms or any Subscription Documentation (as defined below) referencing these terms, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions including Podium’s Privacy Policy (together, these “**Terms**”, or this “**Agreement**”).

If you are using a Podium Service on behalf of a company or other entity, then “Client” or “you” means that entity, and you are binding that entity to this Agreement. You represent and warrant that you have the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that, if the Client is an entity, this Agreement is entered into by an employee or agent with all necessary authority to bind that entity to this Agreement.

This Agreement includes and hereby incorporates by reference any Subscription Documentation executed between you and Podium, as well as any policies or exhibits linked to or referenced herein. **If you have entered into a separate written agreement with Podium concerning specific Services, the terms of such agreement control if there is any conflict between the terms of such agreement and these Terms.** Please note that we may modify this Agreement as described in Section 16.8 below.

1. **DEFINITIONS.**

1.1. “**Business Associate Agreement**” (hereinafter “**BAA**”) means a written agreement between a covered entity and a business associate containing the elements specified at 45 CFR 164.504(e).

1.2. “**Confidential Information**” means code, inventions, know-how, product plans, technical and financial, business, operational, or other information exchanged under this Agreement or learned during the performance of this Agreement, or that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should reasonably be considered confidential based on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information disclosed.

1.3. “**HIPAA**” means the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “**HITECH Act**”), the Administrative Simplification section of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as codified at 42 U.S.C. §1320d through d-8, as amended from time to time, and the requirements of any regulations promulgated under either the HITECH Act or HIPAA, including, without limitation, the federal privacy regulations as contained in 45 C.F.R.

Other terms are defined in other Sections of this Agreement.

2. **SERVICES.**

2.1. Services. Podium provides a proprietary multi-product platform that includes without limitation reputation management tools (“**Reviews**” and “**Feedback**”), messaging and communication tools (“**Inbox**,” “**Webchat**,” “**Videochat**,” “**Teamchat**,” “**Automations**,” **“Voice,”** and “**Campaigns**”), payment processing (“**Payments**”), certain Free Access Subscription or Beta Releases (as defined below), and any other services Podium may offer from time to time (together with the Website, the “**Service(s)**”). Client will, from time to time, enter into a proposal, quote, services/purchase agreement, order form, statement of work, or otherwise click to accept or agree to an online registration form, which references this Agreement (“**Subscription Documentation**”) and details the Services ordered from Podium and, if applicable, the usage limits or other scope of use descriptions for the Services (including without limitation any usage or volume limits, numerical limits on Authorized Users, and descriptions of product feature levels) (the “**Scope of Use**”). Client may be provided the option to purchase certain Services as part of a package or bundle offer (each, a “**Bundle**”), as detailed in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium has no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in this Agreement, including any applicable Subscription Documentation.

2.2. Alteration of Subscription Documentation. Any amendments or modification to any existing Subscription Documentation must be agreed to in writing by the parties. Podium has no obligation to perform any Services under the amended Subscription Documentation until the parties have agreed to the effect of such changes on the applicable Fees.

2.3. Modification of the Services. Podium reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Services at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Services), or to alter the offering of the Services (including by adding, limiting, or discontinuing certain Bundle offers) temporarily or permanently. Podium also reserves the right to replace certain Services and Bundles with functionally equivalent Services or Bundles, at its sole discretion. In the event Podium makes any modification or alteration to the Services or the offering thereof that has a material adverse effect on the functionality of the Services ordered under your Subscription Documentation, Client may terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rated refund of pre-paid unused Fees for the remainder of Client’s Subscription Term (as defined below).

2.4. Additional Terms. Client’s subscription to or use of certain Services may be subject to additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Services or certain features of the Services that we may post on or link to from the Services (the “**Additional Terms**”). For example, if you elect to use Podium Payments, your use is subject to the Podium Payments Service Terms (currently available at https://www.podium.com/payments-terms-and-conditions/). To the extent applicable, all Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.

  

3. **USE RIGHTS; RESTRICTIONS.**

3.1. Use of Services. Subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any Additional Terms, Podium grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license during the applicable Subscription Term and within the Territory (to the extent available in the Territory) to: (a) install and use an object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Services; and (b) access and use the Services, designated on Client’s Subscription Documentation solely for Client’s internal business purposes, but only in accordance with this Agreement, Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/acceptable-use-policy/](https://www.podium.com/acceptable-use-policy/)), the applicable Subscription Documentation, and all applicable Scope of Use descriptions. Although the Services may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Services are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Services from territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Services in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Account Registration. Client will register for a Podium account in order to access or receive the Services. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete, and will be governed by Podium’s Privacy Policy (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/privacypolicy](https://www.podium.com/privacypolicy)) as may be amended from time to time. Client agrees to keep its account information up to date so that Podium may send notices, statements, and other information by email or through Client’s account. By using or accessing the Website, Client agrees and consents to Podium’s use of cookies in accordance with the terms of Podium’s Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for all use of the Services account. Podium will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of Client’s account.

3.3. Eligibility and Use by Others. By agreeing to these Terms, Client warrants that it and its employees and contractors whom Client has authorized to access the Services on its behalf (“**Authorized Users**”): (a) are over 18 years old; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) will comply with all applicable laws when using the Services. Client may permit its Authorized Users to use the Services provided their use is for Client’s benefit only and remains in compliance with this Agreement. Authorized Users are and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be communicated by posting to the Website or on a click-through basis to Authorized Users upon access to the Services and/or Website.

3.4. Responsibility for Authorized Users. Client will be responsible and liable for all Authorized Users’ use and access and their compliance with the terms and conditions herein. Client will be solely responsible for authorizing and creating user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials for Authorized Users. Client is solely responsible for determining its Authorized Users and restricting and/or terminating the rights of such users during the Subscription Term, as Client deems appropriate. Provided, however, Podium may, in its sole discretion, suspend any Authorized User’s access to the Services. Client is solely responsible for ensuring that any user IDs, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens) for the Services are kept strictly confidential and not shared with any unauthorized person. Additionally, Client is solely responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all laws applicable to Client. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions.

3.5. Use by Customers. Any person that is a client, customer, or patient of Client, or that is a potential client, customer, or patient of Client (“**Customer(s)**”) who accesses and/or uses the Services, including via Client’s website, are subject to the Acceptable Use Policy and such other terms as may be provided by Podium from time to time, which includes Podium’s right to remove or disable access to any Customer or content or resource that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

3.6. General Restrictions. Client must not (and must not allow any third party to): (a) rent, lease, copy, transfer, sublicense, or provide access to the Podium Technology (as defined below) to a third party (except Authorized Users as specifically authorized above); (b) incorporate the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) into, or use it with or to provide, any site, product, or service; (c) use the Podium Technology (or any portion thereof) for time-sharing purposes or for a third party’s benefit; (d) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Podium Technology (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information); (e) modify or create a derivative work of the Podium Technology or any portion thereof; (f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Podium Technology or Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (g) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for Services; (h) distribute any portion of the Podium Technology other than as specifically permitted above; (i) use the Services in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; or (j) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Podium Technology including in any reports or output obtained from the Podium Technology.

3.7. Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Subject to Client’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Podium may provide Client with certain Services for free or on a trial basis (a “**Free Access Subscription**”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Services, integrations, or features (“**Beta Releases**”) for the Subscription Term set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (if applicable). This Section and any relevant Additional Terms will apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release (even if a Beta Release is provided for a fee or counts towards Client’s Scope of Use allocations) and supersedes any contrary provision in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6 (Availability of Services; Support) will not apply to any Free Access Subscription or Beta Releases. Podium may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Client with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in this Agreement, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CLIENT AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CLIENT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. You may choose to use Beta Releases at your sole discretion. Podium makes no guarantees or promises with respect to the continued availability of any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases or that future versions of a Beta Release will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. Podium may discontinue Beta Releases at any time, in our sole discretion, and decide not to make any Beta Releases generally available. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Podium may terminate Client’s right to use any Free Access Subscription or Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Podium’s sole discretion, without liability.

4\. **CLIENT DATA.**

4.1. Rights in Client Data. As between the parties, Client retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to any text, images, or other content and data that Client selects or submits for use or incorporation with the Services (including without limitation, chat and message logs, Customer Data, PHI, or any Third-Party Content) (“**Client Data**”). “**Customer Data**” means data related to the identity, characteristics, and activities of Customers, collected or submitted to the Services by Client or captured by the Services. To the extent Client is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, as those terms are defined in HIPAA, “Client Data” also includes PHI. “**Third-Party Content**” means content, data, or other materials that Client provides to the Podium Services from its third-party data providers, including through Third-Party Products (as defined below) used by Client. Client hereby grants Podium a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Client Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services and related services to Client and as otherwise provided herein. Client further instructs Podium to use and disclose Client Data and Customer Data as necessary to (a) provide the Services consistent with this Agreement and Podium’s Privacy Policy, including detecting, investigating, and preventing security incidents, spam, fraud, or unlawful use of the Services, and (b) respond to Client’s inquiries or any technical problems and ensure the Services are working properly.

4.2. Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Client agrees that Podium will have the right to generate usage data from Client use of the Services and may aggregate anonymized Client Data (“**Aggregate/Anonymous Data**”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that Aggregate/Anonymous Data is Podium Technology, which Podium may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve Podium’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). Podium will not distribute Aggregate/Anonymous Data in a manner that personally identifies Client or its Customers, or that would otherwise violate applicable laws. If Client and Podium have entered into a BAA, Podium will use the Aggregate/Anonymous Data only in conformity with the terms of such agreement.

4.3. Monitoring. Client understands and agrees that Podium, and any third-party platform(s) Client uses or accesses in connection with the Services, may monitor and analyze Client Data or Customer Data (including but not limited to reviews, surveys, messages, chats, etc.) to improve the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to improve Client’s experience using the Website, Services, or third-party platform; to customize and communicate informational or product offerings and promotions to Client; to ensure compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy (including taking corrective action permitted therein); and/or to make the Website, Services, or third-party platform more helpful or useful to Client and other users.

4.4. Security. Podium agrees to maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed, in its discretion, to secure its systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If Client is a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Podium and Client agree to the terms of Podium’s BAA (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement](https://www.podium.com/business-associate-agreement)/), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize PHI in accordance with the BAA. Podium takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Client Data other than its express security obligations in this Section.

4.5. Storage. Podium does not provide an archiving service. During the Subscription Term, Client acknowledges that Podium may delete Client Data no longer in active use. Except for requirements that are included in any BAA entered into between Podium and Client, Podium expressly disclaims all other obligations with respect to storage.

5\. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS.**

5.1. Warranty. Client warrants and represents that it is in full compliance with all applicable state, federal, and international laws, rules, and regulations and that Client will not use the Services in a manner that would violate or cause Podium to violate any obligation with respect to any such laws, rules, or regulations, or amendments thereto, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the CAN-SPAM Act, Do Not Call rules and prohibitions, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”). Client also warrants and represents that: (a) Client has sole ownership of any Client Data it provides to Podium, or otherwise has legal rights to provide such Client Data, and Client Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights; (b) Podium’s possession and/or use of the Client Data on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services, as contemplated hereunder, will not violate any contract, statute, or regulation; (c) any Client Data Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) submit for publication on an online review or ratings website as a provider of goods or services will be true and accurate, and will only concern Client or the goods and/or services that Client provides; (d) Client is authorized to provide Podium with any Customer, Client, or Authorized User information it provides in connection with the Services, including any personally identifying information; and (e) Client and/or Client’s authorized representative(s) will only use the Services for interaction with actual Customers. If Client receives any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Client Data or its use of Third-Party Products, it will promptly stop using these items with the Services and notify Podium immediately. Additionally, if an integration is included in the Services Client orders, Client grants Podium the right to access Client’s Information or CRM system directly or through a third-party service for the purposes of fulfilling Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, and Client warrants that Client is not restricted by law or applicable agreement from granting Podium such right. Podium will not be held liable for any consequences of false and/or inaccurate content published to an online review or ratings website through Podium by Client or its Authorized Users.

5.2. Customer Consent; Intended Use of the Services. Client understands and agrees that the Services are intended to allow Client to send electronic communication, including but not limited to text messages, only to Client’s own current Customers who have consented to the receipt of such communications and are provided with necessary notices in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Client also understands and agrees that the Services are intended primarily to be used to send transactional and/or informational messages, not advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable laws, rules, and regulations (hereinafter, collectively “Marketing”), and that Client may use the Services to send Marketing messages only via Podium Campaigns. Accordingly, Client will for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable laws, prior to utilizing the Services; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) send Marketing messages through Podium only via Podium Campaigns and only in compliance with all local, state, national, and international laws, regulations and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its compliance with applicable law and regulations and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable law or regulation and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its discretion, that Client has violated this Section 5.

  

6\. **AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES; SUPPORT.**

6.1. Availability. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client; (b) failures, errors, or defects in the facilities, hardware, software, or network of Client; or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term. Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability will be support in accordance with Section 6.2.

6.2. Support. Podium makes available web-based support through the Website. Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation. Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies. Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment, and other services under this Agreement. The scope, pricing, and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation. Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.

  

7. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

7.1. Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (“**Subscription**”). Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (“**Subscription Fees**”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Additional Terms (collectively, the “**Fees**”). Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

7.2. Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S. dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S. dollars. Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause). If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-renew basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date. The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account. If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due. Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue. Podium will have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts at the annual rate of 12%, compounded monthly, or the maximum lawful amounts, whichever is less. Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium will have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

7.3. Taxes. Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Client must pay any applicable taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium. Client will make tax payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.

7.4. Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to increase Fees for any Services, upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may adjust the Payments Services Fees as set forth in the Payments Service Terms.

  

8\. **TERM AND TERMINATION.**

8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein. Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the “**Subscription Term**”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least one (1) month before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to support@podium.com. If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (“**Subscription Start Date**”). By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause).

8.2. Suspension of Services. Podium may suspend Client’s access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue, or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. Podium may also suspend Client’s access to the Services, remove Client Data, or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations); or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other clients of Podium or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability, or integrity of the Services. Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

8.3. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term. Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes, and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody, or control and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

8.5. Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 3 (Use Rights; Restrictions); 4 (Client Data); 7 (Fees and Payment); 8 (Term and Termination); 9 (Confidential Information); 10 (Podium Technology); 11 (Third-Party Products and Integrations); 12 (Indemnification); 13 (Disclaimers); 14 (Limitations of Liability); 15 (Dispute Resolution); and 16 (General).

  

9\. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**

9.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.4), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

9.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

9.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

  

10\. **PODIUM TECHNOLOGY.**

10.1. Ownership and Updates. By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology. Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications, or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) (“**Podium Technology**”) provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein. Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services. The Services are offered as an on-line, hosted product. Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications, or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.

10.2. Feedback. If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, “**Feedback**”), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right, and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

  

11\. **THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS.**

Podium may, from time to time, contract with third-party service providers to facilitate certain features of the Services, as described in this Agreement. Podium may also allow or facilitate Client to make arrangements with other third-party providers that provide products or services in connection with, but which are not included in, the Services as described in this Agreement. If Client elects to use applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems, and other products that are not Podium Technology (“**Third-Party Products**”) in connection with the Services, those products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data. Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party. Podium is not a party to any such terms and will not be liable thereunder. Podium does not warrant or support Third-Party Products or Third-Party Content and disclaims all responsibility and liability for these items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure, or collection of Client Data. Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied, or removed from the Services.

  

12\. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

12.1. Indemnification by Client. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “**Podium Entities**”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services; (b) your violation of any applicable law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including your Customers); (d) any demand, dispute, or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and any Payment Service Provider(s) (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms); (e) any Client Data; (f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers; (g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s warranties and obligations; (h) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that you have violated any law, rule, or regulation; or, (i) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA. Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. Client may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.2. Indemnification by Podium. Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (a) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action.

12.3. Exclusions to Podium’s Indemnification. Podium will not be required to indemnify Client in the event of: (a) modification of the Services by Client, its Authorized Users, affiliates, employees, or contractors in conflict with Client’s obligations or as a result of any prohibited activity under this Agreement, (b) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Additional Terms, the Subscription Documentation, or any other agreement related to this Agreement, or (c) use of the Services in combination with any other application, product, or service not provided by Podium if such claim would not have occurred without such combination.

  

13\. **DISCLAIMERS.**

13.1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, ALL PODIUM TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PODIUM TECHNOLOGY ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

  

14\. **LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGE, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00 US). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

15.2. Judicial Action.

16\. **GENERAL.**

16.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 16.1 will be null and void.

16.2. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses on Client’s account or, at Podium’s option, to Client’s last-known postal address. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Services or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website or the Services. Each party hereby consents to receipt of electronic notices and agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering Client or its network provider may apply to email notifications.

16.3. Publicity. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Podium may use Client’s name, logo, and marks to identify Client as a Podium Client on Podium’s website and other marketing materials.

16.4. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium in order to provide the Services and related services under this Agreement.

16.5. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Podium from disclosing Client Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client where permitted to do so.

16.6. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

16.7. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

16.8. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If Client does not agree to the updated Terms, Client will no longer have the right to use the Services. Except as otherwise described in this Section, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

16.9. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for ease of reference only. They are not intended as a complete re-statement of the matters contained under each heading, and you acknowledge that you have read and understand all the text of this Agreement, and not just the headings.

16.10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

16.11. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Client acknowledges that each Subscription only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Subscription Documentation and not any affiliates. Furthermore, Client’s affiliates are not permitted to use the Services under these Terms unless an affiliate agrees to these Terms individually and creates its own account.

It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms provided by Client (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Client) are for administrative purposes only, and have no legal effect.

16.14. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will constitute an original, and all of which will constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and delivery will be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

16.15. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof.

**Podium Acceptable Use Policy**

  

This Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”) sets out rules applicable to your use of the Podium Corporation, Inc. (“Podium”, “we”, “us” or “our”) Services and Podium Technology, including via our clients’ websites or platforms (the “Services”). The examples described in this Policy are not exhaustive.

This Policy should be read in conjunction with the Podium Terms of Service (“Podium Terms of Service”) (currently available at: [https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us)) into which it is incorporated by reference. We may suspend, terminate, or take other interim action regarding your access to or use of the Services, if, in our sole judgment, we believe you, directly or indirectly, violated this Policy or authorize or help others to do so.

We may modify this Policy from time to time by posting a revised version on our Website. By using the Services, you agree to the latest version of this Policy. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Policy have the meaning set forth in the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us).

General Policies/Requirements. We all expect that the messages and communications we want to send and receive will reach the intended recipient(s), unhindered by filtering or other blockers. An important step you can take to make that expectation a reality is to prevent unwanted communications by only sending messages and communications that comply with applicable laws and communications-industry guidelines/standards. To that end, all communications originating from your use of the Podium Services and Podium Technology (including but not limited to SMS, MMS, webchat, Voice, and similar messaging channels available through the Services) are subject to, and must comply with, the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), including this Policy, which sets out certain rules and/or prohibitions regarding: Consent (“opt-in”); Revocation of Consent (“opt-out”); Sender identification; Messaging Usage; Prohibited Content; Filtering Evasion; and Enforcement.

* **Consent Requirements**
    
    * _Standard Consent Requirements._ Prior to sending the first message to an individual, you must obtain agreement from the message recipient to communicate with them - this is referred to as "consent." You must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the type you're going to send.
        
        * You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow or otherwise provided consent. This record of consent must be retained as set forth by local regulations or best practices after the end user opts out of receiving messages.
            
        * If you do not send an initial message to that individual within a reasonable period after receiving consent (or as set forth by local regulations or best practices), then you will need to reconfirm consent in the first message you send to that recipient.
            
        * The consent applies only to you, and to the specific use that the recipient has consented to. Consent can't be bought, sold, or exchanged. For example, you can't obtain the consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party. You also can't treat it as blanket consent allowing you to send messages from other brands or companies you may have, or additional messages about other uses for which you haven’t received consent.
            
    * _Alternative Consent Requirements._ While consent is always required and the consent requirements noted above are generally the safest path, there are two scenarios where consent can be received differently.
        
        * _Contact initiated by an individual_
            
            * If an individual sends a message to you, you may respond in an exchange with that individual. For example, if an individual texts your phone number asking for your hours of operation, you can respond directly to that individual, relaying your open hours. In such a case, the individual’s inbound message to you constitutes both consent and proof of consent. Remember that the consent is limited only to that particular conversation. Unless you obtain additional consent, don't send messages that are outside that conversation.
                
        * _In__formational content to an individual based on a prior relationship_
            
            * You may send a message to an individual where you have a prior relationship, provided that individual provided their phone number to you, and has taken some action to trigger the potential communication, and has not opted out or otherwise expressed a preference to not receive messages from you.
                
            * Actions can include a button press, alert setup, appointments, or order placements. Examples of acceptable messages in these scenarios include appointment reminders, receipts, one-time passwords, order/shipping/reservation confirmations, drivers coordinating pick-up locations with riders, and repair persons confirming service call times. The message can't attempt to promote a product, convince someone to buy something, or advocate for a social cause.
                
    * _Periodic Messages and Ongoing Consent._
        
        * If you intend to send messages to a recipient on an ongoing basis, you should confirm the recipient’s consent by offering them a clear reminder of how to unsubscribe from those messages using standard opt-out language (defined below). You must also respect the message recipient’s preferences in terms of frequency of contact. You also need to proactively ask individuals to reconfirm their consent as set forth by local regulations and best practices.
            
* **Identifying Yourself as the Sender**
    
    * Every message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation.
        
* **Opt-out**
    
    * The initial message that you send to an individual needs to include the following language: “Reply END to unsubscribe,” or the equivalent using another standard opt-out keyword, such as STOP, STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE,, and QUIT.
        
    * Individuals must have the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with a standard opt-out keyword. When an individual opts out, you may deliver one final message to confirm that the opt-out has been processed, but any subsequent messages are not allowed. An individual must once again provide consent before you can send any additional messages.
        

**Prohibited Content.** You agree that you will not use the Services, or encourage, promote, facilitate, or instruct others to use the Services, to send messages that contain, offer, promote, reference, or link to any information or content related to any of the following:

* _Solicitations or Advertising._ Any messages, communication, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like “spam”), including commercial advertising and informational announcements or otherwise, that are unsolicited or for which you do not have the proper consent from the intended recipient. If you are a Customer of any Podium Client, this includes using the Services to send any such message, communication, or announcement to a Podium Client or any other person or entity.
    
* _I__llegal, Harmful, or Fraudulent Activities._ Any activities that are illegal, that violate the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others, our operations, or reputation, including but not limited to offering, promoting, disseminating, or facilitating:
    
    * child pornography, child sexual abuse material, or other sexually exploitative content; fraudulent goods, services, schemes, or promotions;
        
    * make-money-fast or “get-rich-quick” schemes (including work-from-home programs, risk investment opportunities, ponzi and pyramid schemes);
        
    * high-risk financial services (including payday loans, short-term high-interest loans, third-party auto or mortgage loans, student loans, or cryptocurrency);
        
    * third-party lead generation services (such as companies that buy, sell, or share consumer information);

**Podium Acceptable Use Policy**

  

This Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”) sets out rules applicable to your use of the Podium Corporation, Inc. (“Podium”, “we”, “us” or “our”) Services and Podium Technology, including via our clients’ websites or platforms (the “Services”). The examples described in this Policy are not exhaustive.

This Policy should be read in conjunction with the Podium Terms of Service (“Podium Terms of Service”) (currently available at: [https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us)) into which it is incorporated by reference. We may suspend, terminate, or take other interim action regarding your access to or use of the Services, if, in our sole judgment, we believe you, directly or indirectly, violated this Policy or authorize or help others to do so.

We may modify this Policy from time to time by posting a revised version on our Website. By using the Services, you agree to the latest version of this Policy. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Policy have the meaning set forth in the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us).

General Policies/Requirements. We all expect that the messages and communications we want to send and receive will reach the intended recipient(s), unhindered by filtering or other blockers. An important step you can take to make that expectation a reality is to prevent unwanted communications by only sending messages and communications that comply with applicable laws and communications-industry guidelines/standards. To that end, all communications originating from your use of the Podium Services and Podium Technology (including but not limited to SMS, MMS, webchat, Voice, and similar messaging channels available through the Services) are subject to, and must comply with, the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), including this Policy, which sets out certain rules and/or prohibitions regarding: Consent (“opt-in”); Revocation of Consent (“opt-out”); Sender identification; Messaging Usage; Prohibited Content; Filtering Evasion; and Enforcement.

* **Consent Requirements**
    
    * _Standard Consent Requirements._ Prior to sending the first message to an individual, you must obtain agreement from the message recipient to communicate with them - this is referred to as "consent." You must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the type you're going to send.
        
        * You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow or otherwise provided consent. This record of consent must be retained as set forth by local regulations or best practices after the end user opts out of receiving messages.
            
        * If you do not send an initial message to that individual within a reasonable period after receiving consent (or as set forth by local regulations or best practices), then you will need to reconfirm consent in the first message you send to that recipient.
            
        * The consent applies only to you, and to the specific use that the recipient has consented to. Consent can't be bought, sold, or exchanged. For example, you can't obtain the consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party. You also can't treat it as blanket consent allowing you to send messages from other brands or companies you may have, or additional messages about other uses for which you haven’t received consent.
            
    * _Alternative Consent Requirements._ While consent is always required and the consent requirements noted above are generally the safest path, there are two scenarios where consent can be received differently.
        
        * _Contact initiated by an individual_
            
            * If an individual sends a message to you, you may respond in an exchange with that individual. For example, if an individual texts your phone number asking for your hours of operation, you can respond directly to that individual, relaying your open hours. In such a case, the individual’s inbound message to you constitutes both consent and proof of consent. Remember that the consent is limited only to that particular conversation. Unless you obtain additional consent, don't send messages that are outside that conversation.
                
        * _In__formational content to an individual based on a prior relationship_
            
            * You may send a message to an individual where you have a prior relationship, provided that individual provided their phone number to you, and has taken some action to trigger the potential communication, and has not opted out or otherwise expressed a preference to not receive messages from you.
                
            * Actions can include a button press, alert setup, appointments, or order placements. Examples of acceptable messages in these scenarios include appointment reminders, receipts, one-time passwords, order/shipping/reservation confirmations, drivers coordinating pick-up locations with riders, and repair persons confirming service call times. The message can't attempt to promote a product, convince someone to buy something, or advocate for a social cause.
                
    * _Periodic Messages and Ongoing Consent._
        
        * If you intend to send messages to a recipient on an ongoing basis, you should confirm the recipient’s consent by offering them a clear reminder of how to unsubscribe from those messages using standard opt-out language (defined below). You must also respect the message recipient’s preferences in terms of frequency of contact. You also need to proactively ask individuals to reconfirm their consent as set forth by local regulations and best practices.
            
* **Identifying Yourself as the Sender**
    
    * Every message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation.
        
* **Opt-out**
    
    * The initial message that you send to an individual needs to include the following language: “Reply END to unsubscribe,” or the equivalent using another standard opt-out keyword, such as STOP, STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE,, and QUIT.
        
    * Individuals must have the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with a standard opt-out keyword. When an individual opts out, you may deliver one final message to confirm that the opt-out has been processed, but any subsequent messages are not allowed. An individual must once again provide consent before you can send any additional messages.
        

**Prohibited Content.** You agree that you will not use the Services, or encourage, promote, facilitate, or instruct others to use the Services, to send messages that contain, offer, promote, reference, or link to any information or content related to any of the following:

* _Solicitations or Advertising._ Any messages, communication, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like “spam”), including commercial advertising and informational announcements or otherwise, that are unsolicited or for which you do not have the proper consent from the intended recipient. If you are a Customer of any Podium Client, this includes using the Services to send any such message, communication, or announcement to a Podium Client or any other person or entity.
    
* _I__llegal, Harmful, or Fraudulent Activities._ Any activities that are illegal, that violate the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others, our operations, or reputation, including but not limited to offering, promoting, disseminating, or facilitating:
    
    * child pornography, child sexual abuse material, or other sexually exploitative content; fraudulent goods, services, schemes, or promotions;
        
    * make-money-fast or “get-rich-quick” schemes (including work-from-home programs, risk investment opportunities, ponzi and pyramid schemes);
        
    * high-risk financial services (including payday loans, short-term high-interest loans, third-party auto or mortgage loans, student loans, or cryptocurrency);
        
    * third-party lead generation services (such as companies that buy, sell, or share consumer information);
        
    * debt collection or forgiveness services (including third-party debt collection, debt consolidation, debt reduction, or credit repair programs)
        
    * illegal or regulated substances (including, but not limited to, Cannabis, CBD, or offers for (or payment transactions relating to) Prescription Drugs that cannot be sold over-the-counter);
        
    * Gambling;
        
    * “SHAFT” use cases (Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco, including vaping-related activities);
        
    * phishing or pharming.
        
* _Infringing Content._ Content that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others.
    
* _Offensive Content._ Content that is harassing, defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable.
    
* _Harmful Content._ Content or other computer technology that may damage, interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, program, or data, or otherwise effect a security breach, including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, or cancelbots.
    
* _Evasive Content._ Content that is designed to intentionally evade filters, detection, or monitoring (see below)
    
* _Prohibited Industries._ If you are using Podium’s Payment Services, you may not use the services in conjunction with any activities identified as Prohibited Industries, as defined in Podium’s Payment Service Terms.
    

**Message Abuse; Falsification of Identity or Origin.** You will not send messages using spam bots or other similar systems, alter or obscure mail headers, provide false identification, or assume a sender’s identity without the sender’s explicit permission. You will also not create a false identity or attempt to mislead others as to the identity of the sender or the origin of any data or communications.

**Evasion.** You may not use the Services or Podium Technology to evade Podium’s (including our subcontractor’s) or a telecommunications provider’s unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms. Examples of prohibited practices include:

* Content designed to evade detection. As noted above, we do not allow content which has been specifically designed to evade detection by unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms. This includes intentionally misspelled words or non-standard opt-out phrases which have been specifically created with the intent to evade these mechanisms.
    
* Snowshoeing. We do not permit snowshoeing, which is defined as spreading similar or identical messages across many phone numbers with the intent or effect of evading unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms.
    
* Use of shared public URL shorteners. Where a web address (i.e., Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) shortener is used, you should not use links that have been shortened using shared public URL shorteners like Bitly or TinyURL. If you want to include shortened URLs in your messages, we recommend using a dedicated short domain.
    

**Reverse Engineering and Related Restrictions.** You will not (a) modify or create a derivative work of the Services or any portion thereof; (b) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (c) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for the Services; or (d) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Services, including in any reports or output obtained from the Services.

**Scope of Use and Reasonable Use Limits.** Unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, all Services (including, in particular, Bulk Messages, Automations, bulk uploads, and/or the Podium API) are subject to the Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Additionally, any Services for which specific Scope of Use limits have not been expressly designated, or which have been designated as “unlimited”, are intended (and may only be used) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including this AUP and your Subscription Documentation.

Other use restrictions, applicable to specific Podium Services, may also be found in the Additional Terms applicable to those Services.

**Our Monitoring and Enforcement.** We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to monitor content on and sent through the Services and to investigate any violation of the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), including this Policy, or misuse of the Services.

We may suspend, terminate, or take other interim action regarding your access to or use of the Services, if, in our sole judgment, we believe you, directly or indirectly, violated this Policy or authorize or help others to do so.

We may modify this Policy from time to time by posting a revised version on our Website. By using the Services, you agree to the latest version of this Policy. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Policy have the meaning set forth in the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us).

General Policies/Requirements. We all expect that the messages and communications we want to send and receive will reach the intended recipient(s), unhindered by filtering or other blockers. An important step you can take to make that expectation a reality is to prevent unwanted communications by only sending messages and communications that comply with applicable laws and communications-industry guidelines/standards. To that end, all communications originating from your use of the Podium Services and Podium Technology (including but not limited to SMS, MMS, webchat, Voice, and similar messaging channels available through the Services) are subject to, and must comply with, the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), including this Policy, which sets out certain rules and/or prohibitions regarding: Consent (“opt-in”); Revocation of Consent (“opt-out”); Sender identification; Messaging Usage; Prohibited Content; Filtering Evasion; and Enforcement.

* **Consent Requirements**
    
    * _Standard Consent Requirements._ Prior to sending the first message to an individual, you must obtain agreement from the message recipient to communicate with them - this is referred to as "cons ent." You must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the type you're going to send.
        
        * You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow or otherwise provided consent. This record of consent must be retained as set forth by local regulations or best practices after the end user opts out of receiving messages.
            
        * If you do not send an initial message to that individual within a reasonable period after receiving consent (or as set forth by local regulations or best practices), then you will need to reconfirm consent in the first message you send to that recipient.
            
        * The consent applies only to you, and to the specific use that the recipient has consented to. Consent can't be bought, sold, or exchanged. For example, you can't obtain the consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party. You also can't treat it as blanket consent allowing you to send messages from other brands or companies you may have, or additional messages about other uses for which you haven’t received consent.
            
    * _Alternative Consent Requirements._ While consent is always required and the consent requirements noted above are generally the safest path, there are two scenarios where consent can be received differently.
        
        * _Contact initiated by an individual_
            
            * If an individual sends a message to you, you may respond in an exchange with that individual. For example, if an individual texts your phone number asking for your hours of operation, you can respond directly to that individual, relaying your open hours. In such a case, the individual’s inbound message to you constitutes both consent and proof of consent. Remember that the consent is limited only to that particular conversation. Unless you obtain additional consent, don't send messages that are outside that conversation.
                
        * _In__formational content to an individual based on a prior relationship_
            
            * You may send a message to an individual where you have a prior relationship, provided that individual provided their phone number to you, and has taken some action to trigger the potential communication, and has not opted out or otherwise expressed a preference to not receive messages from you.
                
            * Actions can include a button press, alert setup, appointments, or order placements. Examples of acceptable messages in these scenarios include appointment reminders, receipts, one-time passwords, order/shipping/reservation confirmations, drivers coordinating pick-up locations with riders, and repair persons confirming service call times. The message can't attempt to promote a product, convince someone to buy something, or advocate for a social cause.
                
    * _Periodic Messages and Ongoing Consent._
        
        * If you intend to send messages to a recipient on an ongoing basis, you should confirm the recipient’s consent by offering them a clear reminder of how to unsubscribe from those messages using standard opt-out language (defined below). You must also respect the message recipient’s preferences in terms of frequency of contact. You also need to proactively ask individuals to reconfirm their consent as set forth by local regulations and best practices.
            
* **Identifying Yourself as the Sender**
    
    * Every message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation.
        
* **Opt-out**
    
    * The initial message that you send to an individual needs to include the following language: “Reply END to unsubscribe,” or the equivalent using another standard opt-out keyword, such as STOP, STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE,, and QUIT.
        
    * Individuals must have the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with a standard opt-out keyword. When an individual opts out, you may deliver one final message to confirm that the opt-out has been processed, but any subsequent messages are not allowed. An individual must once again provide consent before you can send any additional messages.
        

**Prohibited Content.** You agree that you will not use the Services, or encourage, promote, facilitate, or instruct others to use the Services, to send messages that contain, offer, promote, reference, or link to any information or content related to any of the following:

* _Solicitations or Advertising._ Any messages, communication, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like “spam”), including commercial advertising and informational announcements or otherwise, that are unsolicited or for which you do not have the proper consent from the intended recipient. If you are a Customer of any Podium Client, this includes using the Services to send any such message, communication, or announcement to a Podium Client or any other person or entity.
    
* _I__llegal, Harmful, or Fraudulent Activities._ Any activities that are illegal, that violate the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others, our operations, or reputation, including but not limited to offering, promoting, disseminating, or facilitating:
    
    * child pornography, child sexual abuse material, or other sexually exploitative content; fraudulent goods, services, schemes, or promotions;
        
    * make-money-fast or “get-rich-quick” schemes (including work-from-home programs, risk investment opportunities, ponzi and pyramid schemes);
        
    * high-risk financial services (including payday loans, short-term high-interest loans, third-party auto or mortgage loans, student loans, or cryptocurrency);
        
    * third-party lead generation services (such as companies that buy, sell, or share consumer information);
        
    * debt collection or forgiveness services (including third-party debt collection, debt consolidation, debt reduction, or credit repair programs)
        
    * illegal or regulated substances (including, but not limited to, Cannabis, CBD, or offers for (or payment transactions relating to) Prescription Drugs that cannot be sold over-the-counter);
        
    * Gambling;
        
    * “SHAFT” use cases (Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco, including vaping-related activities);
        
    * phishing or pharming.
        
* _Infringing Content._ Content that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others.
    
* _Offensive Content._ Content that is harassing, defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable.
    
* _Harmful Content._ Content or other computer technology that may damage, interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, program, or data, or otherwise effect a security breach, including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, or cancelbots.
    
* _Evasive Content._ Content that is designed to intentionally evade filters, detection, or monitoring (see below)
    
* _Prohibited Industries._ If you are using Podium’s Payment Services, you may not use the services in conjunction with any activities identified as Prohibited Industries, as defined in Podium’s Payment Service Terms.
    

**Message Abuse; Falsification of Identity or Origin.** You will not send messages using spam bots or other similar systems, alter or obscure mail headers, provide false identification, or assume a sender’s identity without the sender’s explicit permission. You will also not create a false identity or attempt to mislead others as to the identity of the sender or the origin of any data or communications.

**Evasion.** You may not use the Services or Podium Technology to evade Podium’s (including our subcontractor’s) or a telecommunications provider’s unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms. Examples of prohibited practices include:

* Content designed to evade detection. As noted above, we do not allow content which has been specifically designed to evade detection by unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms. This includes intentionally misspelled words or non-standard opt-out phrases which have been specifically created with the intent to evade these mechanisms.
    
* Snowshoeing. We do not permit snowshoeing, which is defined as spreading similar or identical messages across many phone numbers with the intent or effect of evading unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms.
    
* Use of shared public URL shorteners. Where a web address (i.e., Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) shortener is used, you should not use links that have been shortened using shared public URL shorteners like Bitly or TinyURL. If you want to include shortened URLs in your messages, we recommend using a dedicated short domain.
    

**Reverse Engineering and Related Restrictions.** You will not (a) modify or create a derivative work of the Services or any portion thereof; (b) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or non-public APIs to any Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law and then only upon advance notice to Podium; (c) break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits for the Services; or (d) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Services, including in any reports or output obtained from the Services.

**Our Monitoring and Enforcement.** We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to monitor content on and sent through the Services and to investigate any violation of the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), including this Policy, or misuse of the Services. We may remove or disable access to any user, content, or resource that violates the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) or this Policy or any other agreement we have with you for use of the Services. We may report any activity that we suspect violates any law or regulation to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties. Our reporting may include disclosing appropriate customer information. We may also cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other appropriate third parties to help with the investigation and prosecution of illegal conduct by providing network and systems information related to alleged violations of this Policy.

**Reporting Violations.** If you become aware of any violation of this Policy, you will immediately notify us and provide us with assistance, as requested, to stop or remedy the violation.

**Podium Payments Service Terms**

By using or accessing Podium’s Payments Service, as defined herein, or by signing or otherwise accepting any Subscription Documentation referencing these terms, you (also referred to as “**Client**”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “**Payments Service Terms**”).

These Payments Service Terms incorporate by this reference the [**Podium Terms of Service**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) which, among other terms, contains provisions governing the resolution of claims (see “Disclaimers”, “Limitations of Liability”, “Dispute Resolution”, “General”). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Payments Service Terms and the Podium Terms of Service, these Payments Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used in these Payments Service Terms without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Payments Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references in the Podium Terms of Service to the “**Agreement**” will include these Payments Service Terms.

1. **DEFINITIONS.**

1.1 **“Payment Processing Services**” means the ability for you to submit, manage, and complete Transactions with your Customers via the Services, and "**Payment Processing Service Providers**" means payment processors that Podium uses to enable the Payment Processing Services.

1.2 “**Payments Service**” means the Payment Processing Services, together with such related functionality as Podium may offer from time to time, as provided by Podium and the Payment Services Providers, and “**Payment Service Providers**” means the third-party service providers used by Podium to facilitate certain features of the Payments Service. Payment Service Providers includes Payment Processing Service Providers, and Podium may add or remove Payment Service Providers from time to time.

1.3 “**Personal Data**” means information about an identifiable individual or information that is capable of being used (alone or in combination with other information) to identify an individual, (not a company, legal entity, or machine) and is transmitted to or accessible through the Services.

1.4 “**Transaction**” means a request to capture funds for or from a Customer-associated account with respect to a payment from a Customer, and includes the authorization, settlement, and if applicable, disputes, refunds, and reversals, with respect to such payment request. You initiate Transactions by submitting a request to Podium via the Payments Services, and Transactions are enabled by Payment Processing Service Providers.

2\. **SERVICES.**

2.1 Use of the Payments Service. Subject to your performance of your duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide you with access to the Payments Service. Podium will have no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in the Agreement (including any applicable Subscription Documentation).

2.2 Terminal Products. To the extent you use, purchase, or accept any Subscription Documentation that includes any Podium Terminal Products (as defined in the applicable terms), you agree to be bound by the [**Podium Terminal Terms**](https://legal.podium.com/#cardreaders).

2.3 Limited Payment Services. Podium may, from time to time and subject to certain restrictions and/or limitations, make certain limited features of the Payments Service (“**Limited Payment Services**”), such as initiation of a Transaction, available to you on a preliminary basis before you have verified your PPSP Account (as defined below) or linked a valid bank account (“**Client Bank Account**”) to your PPSP Account. If you elect to use these Limited Payments Services prior to verifying your PPSP Account or linking a valid Client Bank Account to your PPSP Account, you understand and agree that you will not be able to complete the Transaction(s), including the settlement and disbursement of corresponding funds unless and until you connect a valid Client Bank Account. Any funds associated with your incomplete Transaction(s) will be considered Unclaimed Funds (as defined below) and will be treated accordingly.

2.4 Stored Credentials. Podium may enable functionality in the Payments Service that allows your Customers to store and reuse payment credentials. Stored credentials may be stored on your behalf, or on your Customer’s behalf. If credentials are stored on your behalf, you may subsequently instruct Podium to initiate a Transaction with that Customer using those credentials, provided that you do so in compliance with: (i) the express consent that you have received from the Customer, as documented in writing; and (ii) these Payments Service Terms and the PPSP Agreement. Podium may decline to process any such Transaction that you initiate until it is satisfied that you have met this compliance obligation. If credentials are stored on behalf of a Customer, then you may not use those credentials to initiate a Transaction without express authorization of the Customer – it is up to the Customer to decide whether to reuse those credentials to complete a Transaction. You are not entitled to use stored credentials other than as specified in this section, and you will never be entitled to directly access or export stored credentials.

2.5. Subscription and Recurring Transactions. If you use the Payment Services for subscription or recurring Transactions you must ensure that you do so in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the payment method for which you are initiating the subscription or recurring Transaction. Without limiting the previous sentence, you must (a) obtain informed consent from Customers before initiating a series of recurring or subscription Transactions, (b) publish and provide Customers with access to a reasonable process by which Customers may cancel recurring or subscription Transactions, and (c) promptly comply with any cancellation request made to you by a Customer (including requests not made via your standard cancellation process).

3. **PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES**

3.1 Account Registration. You may access and fully use the Payment Processing Services only after your Payment Processing Service Provider account (“**PPSP Account**”) has been activated and verified within Podium’s platform. You agree and acknowledge that activation of a PSPP Account is subject to approval by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider, and such Payment Processing Service Provider may suspend or terminate your PPSP Account at any time in accordance with the PPSP Agreement (as defined below). The information you provide to Podium to facilitate the activation and verification of your PPSP Account must be accurate, current, and complete. Until you have submitted, and Payment Processing Service Provider has reviewed and approved, all required information, your access (if any) to the Payment Processing Services will be on a preliminary, limited basis only, and Podium may terminate your access at any time and for any reason.

3.2 PPSP Agreement. Your use of the Payment Processing Services is conditional upon you accepting the terms and conditions imposed by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider with respect to the aspects of the Payments Service that it facilitates (each a "**PPSP Agreement**"). By submitting Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, you must read and agree to PPSP Agreements of the Payment Processing Service Providers that facilitate the processing of payments. Currently, Podium engages Stripe as a Payment Processing Services Provider, and Stripe’s PPSP Agreement is located at [https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal). The Stripe entity that enters into the PPSP Agreement with you, and the content of your Stripe PPSP Agreement, will depend upon your location. For the avoidance of doubt, Podium is not a party to any PPSP Agreement.

3.3 PPSP Account Management. The PSPP Agreement describes how your PPSP Account will be managed, including (i) the use and administration of any data about you, your Customers, and your Transactions, and (ii) action that may be submitted via your PPSP Account, such as initiating and refunding Transactions, handling disputes and other functions that are or may become available through your PPSP Account. You consent to Podium’s disclosure of your data (which may include Personal Data) to each Payment Processing Service Provider and to each Payment Processing Service Provider’s disclosure of your data (which may include Personal Data) to Podium, as the case may be, for the purpose of facilitating the provision of the Payment Processing Services.

3.4 Responsibility for PPSP Compliance. Podium is not responsible for any non-compliance by any Payment Service Provider with the terms of any PPSP Agreement, any laws, or payment method provider rules, or for the acts or omissions of any Payment Service Provider in providing services to you or your Customers.

3.5 Termination and Suspension by PPSP. If a Payment Processing Service Provider terminates or suspends your PPSP Agreement or PPSP Account, for any reason, Podium may immediately terminate or suspend your use of the Payment Processing Services, without any liability to you.

4. **DATA USE.**

4.1 In addition to the Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of the Payments Service, Client grants Podium and its affiliates the worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Payments Service to Client and (ii) to enable Podium to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Payments Service; (b) mitigate fraud, financial loss, or other harm; (c) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, Podium’s products, systems, and tools. Any information, including Personal Data, provided by Client in connection with the Payments Service will be subject to Podium’s [**Privacy Policy**](https://legal.podium.com/#privacypolicy-us).

4.2 Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure.

7.1 Fees. In addition to any other Fees due to Podium under the Subscription Documentation, Client will pay a fee assessed on a per Transaction basis (“**Transaction Fee**”) and any additional fees for additional features within the Payments Service which may be made available by Podium from time to time (including, if applicable, a fee for use of the Premium Fraud Protection Service) (the Transaction Fees, together with the additional fees (if any), are “**Payments Service Fees**”, which form part of the Fees, as that term is defined in the Podium Terms of Service).

7.2 Determining Fees. Fees are set by Podium in its sole discretion, and Fees are payable in accordance with these Payments Service Terms, the Podium Terms of Service, and your applicable Subscription Documentation. If no Payments Service Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, your use of the Payments Service will be subject to Podium’s then-current rates, available at the [**Podium Pricing Page**](https://www.podium.com/pricing/) (for rates applicable to clients located in Australia, please visit this [page](https://www.podium.com.au/packages-local/) or contact us [here](https://www.podium.com.au/contact-us/)). Podium may revise the Payments Service Fees at any time, by providing notice to Client, with the change in Fees effective thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable notice. In addition to the Fees, you must reimburse Podium for any liabilities incurred by Podium as a result of your use of the Payments Service in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or a PPSP Agreement, including penalties and fines. You agree that Podium will have the right to deduct the applicable Fees (including the Payments Service Fees) and any amounts otherwise due to Podium from your PPSP Account. If your PPSP Account balance is insufficient, Podium may debit the Client Bank Account to recover owed amounts.

7.3 Settlement. Podium will arrange to settle Transaction funds to your Client Bank Account in accordance with the Payout Schedule (defined below). You affirm that the account you designate as your Client Bank Account for the purposes of this agreement is: (i) owned by you, and (ii) titled in your legal name or trade name. You also affirm that you are authorized to initiate settlements to and debits from the Client Bank Account you designate. You also agree that Podium has the right to withhold settlement to your Client Bank Account if we reasonably determine that we have incurred or may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, or other legal risks associated with your use of the Payments Service. If we exercise our right to withhold the settlement of funds for any reason, we will communicate the general reason for withholding the funds and give you a timeline and description of the preconditions that must be satisfied for releasing the funds. Additionally, if a refund or reversal is processed for any Transaction you complete using the Payments Service, you understand and agree that the initial Transaction Fees for the related Transaction will not be refunded back to you, unless the applicable Transaction is refunded before 9 p.m. local time on the same calendar day on which the Transaction was initiated.

7.4 Payout Schedule. In your Podium dashboard, Podium will specify the frequency of payouts of your balance to your Client Bank Account (“**Payout Schedule**”). The Payout schedule may vary depending on your Podium Account type, and Podium may delay or withhold a payout, notwithstanding the Payout Schedule, if Podium is entitled to do so under this Agreement. The Payout Schedule refers to the time at which Podium will attempt to initiate a payout, and Podium will not be responsible for any nonconformance with the Payout Schedule due to the acts or omissions of any third party (e.g., a telecommunications provider or financial institution). The payout amount may also take some time to appear in your Client Bank Account balance, due to the operation of systems outside of Podium’s control.

7.5 Reserve. If Podium determines your use of the Payments Service exposes or is likely to expose Podium to liability, Podium may set an amount of funds that Podium will hold to offset this risk (“**Reserve**”). Podium may fund the Reserve from your PSPP Account balance, from funds that you provide, or by debiting the Client Bank Account, and Podium may use the Reserve to offset any amounts that you owe Podium. A failure to fund a Reserve as required by Podium will constitute a breach of this Agreement, and Podium may hold the Reserve until Podium determines that it is no longer necessary.

7.6 Unclaimed Funds or Dormant Accounts. If you leave any funds dormant in a PPSP Account, or if you do not link and/or maintain a link to a valid Client Bank Account, you may have a balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under applicable law (“**Unclaimed Funds**”). In such an event, Podium may be required by law to deliver the Unclaimed Funds to various government agencies. To the extent required by applicable law, Podium will give you notice if we hold Unclaimed Funds payable to you in an account beyond the applicable dormancy period for abandoned property. If Podium or the Payment Processing Service Provider is unable to contact you, we will treat the Unclaimed Funds in your PPSP Account as abandoned and will deliver them to the appropriate government authority.

8. **SUSPENSION & TERMINATION**

8.1 Podium may refuse, condition, or suspend any Transactions that we believe: (i) may violate this Agreement; (ii) are unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal; or (iii) expose you, Podium, or others to risks unacceptable to Podium. If we suspect or know that you are using or have used the Payments Service for unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal purposes, we may share any information related to such activity with the appropriate financial institution, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency consistent with our legal obligations. This information may include information about you, your Payment Provider Account, your Customers, and Transactions made through your use of Payment the Services.

8.2 Podium may also suspend your access to and/or use of the Payments Service, your PPSP Account, and your access to funds in your account, or terminate this Agreement, at any time if you are in breach of this Agreement, a PPSP Agreement, or Podium believes that your continued use of the Payments Service creates, or is likely to create a risk of harm to Podium, a Customer, or any other third party.

8.3 Termination of the Payments Service Terms means that you will no longer be authorized to access the Payments Service, which includes the ability to submit Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, however, termination will not affect your continued liability with respect to Transactions that you submit prior to date of termination.

9. **LIMITATIONS ON PODIUM’S LIABILITY**

9.1 Podium is not responsible for Client’s obligations to its Customers (including properly describing and delivering the goods or services being sold to Customers).

This may include providing customer service, notification, and handling of refunds or Customer complaints, provision of receipts, registering your legal entity, or other actions not related to the Services. You agree to indemnify Podium for any losses we incur based on your failure to properly describe or deliver goods or services, or comply with your legal or contractual obligations to any Payment Service Provider or your Customers.

9.2 This Section is in addition to, and does not limit in any way, the risk allocation provisions of the Podium Service Terms.

**Podium Payments Service Terms**

By using or accessing Podium’s Payments Service, as defined herein, or by signing or otherwise accepting any Subscription Documentation referencing these terms, you (also referred to as “**Client**”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “**Payments Service Terms**”).

These Payments Service Terms incorporate by this reference the [**Podium Terms of Service**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) which, among other terms, contains provisions governing the resolution of claims (see “Disclaimers”, “Limitations of Liability”, “Dispute Resolution”, “General”). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Payments Service Terms and the Podium Terms of Service, these Payments Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used in these Payments Service Terms without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Payments Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references in the Podium Terms of Service to the “**Agreement**” will include these Payments Service Terms.

1. **DEFINITIONS.**

1.1 **“Payment Processing Services**” means the ability for you to submit, manage, and complete Transactions with your Customers via the Services, and "**Payment Processing Service Providers**" means payment processors that Podium uses to enable the Payment Processing Services.

1.2 “**Payments Service**” means the Payment Processing Services, together with such related functionality as Podium may offer from time to time, as provided by Podium and the Payment Services Providers, and “**Payment Service Providers**” means the third-party service providers used by Podium to facilitate certain features of the Payments Service. Payment Service Providers includes Payment Processing Service Providers, and Podium may add or remove Payment Service Providers from time to time.

1.3 “**Personal Data**” means information about an identifiable individual or information that is capable of being used (alone or in combination with other information) to identify an individual, (not a company, legal entity, or machine) and is transmitted to or accessible through the Services.

1.4 “**Transaction**” means a request to capture funds for or from a Customer-associated account with respect to a payment from a Customer, and includes the authorization, settlement, and if applicable, disputes, refunds, and reversals, with respect to such payment request. You initiate Transactions by submitting a request to Podium via the Payments Services, and Transactions are enabled by Payment Processing Service Providers.

2\. **SERVICES.**

2.1 Use of the Payments Service. Subject to your performance of your duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide you with access to the Payments Service. Podium will have no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in the Agreement (including any applicable Subscription Documentation).

2.2 Terminal Products. To the extent you use, purchase, or accept any Subscription Documentation that includes any Podium Terminal Products (as defined in the applicable terms), you agree to be bound by the [**Podium Terminal Terms**](https://legal.podium.com/#cardreaders).

2.3 Limited Payment Services. Podium may, from time to time and subject to certain restrictions and/or limitations, make certain limited features of the Payments Service (“**Limited Payment Services**”), such as initiation of a Transaction, available to you on a preliminary basis before you have verified your PPSP Account (as defined below) or linked a valid bank account (“**Client Bank Account**”) to your PPSP Account. If you elect to use these Limited Payments Services prior to verifying your PPSP Account or linking a valid Client Bank Account to your PPSP Account, you understand and agree that you will not be able to complete the Transaction(s), including the settlement and disbursement of corresponding funds unless and until you connect a valid Client Bank Account. Any funds associated with your incomplete Transaction(s) will be considered Unclaimed Funds (as defined below) and will be treated accordingly.

2.4 Stored Credentials. Podium may enable functionality in the Payments Service that allows your Customers to store and reuse payment credentials. Stored credentials may be stored on your behalf, or on your Customer’s behalf. If credentials are stored on your behalf, you may subsequently instruct Podium to initiate a Transaction with that Customer using those credentials, provided that you do so in compliance with: (i) the express consent that you have received from the Customer, as documented in writing; and (ii) these Payments Service Terms and the PPSP Agreement. Podium may decline to process any such Transaction that you initiate until it is satisfied that you have met this compliance obligation. If credentials are stored on behalf of a Customer, then you may not use those credentials to initiate a Transaction without express authorization of the Customer – it is up to the Customer to decide whether to reuse those credentials to complete a Transaction. You are not entitled to use stored credentials other than as specified in this section, and you will never be entitled to directly access or export stored credentials.

2.5. Subscription and Recurring Transactions. If you use the Payment Services for subscription or recurring Transactions you must ensure that you do so in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the payment method for which you are initiating the subscription or recurring Transaction. Without limiting the previous sentence, you must (a) obtain informed consent from Customers before initiating a series of recurring or subscription Transactions, (b) publish and provide Customers with access to a reasonable process by which Customers may cancel recurring or subscription Transactions, and (c) promptly comply with any cancellation request made to you by a Customer (including requests not made via your standard cancellation process).

3. **PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES**

3.1 Account Registration. You may access and fully use the Payment Processing Services only after your Payment Processing Service Provider account (“**PPSP Account**”) has been activated and verified within Podium’s platform. You agree and acknowledge that activation of a PSPP Account is subject to approval by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider, and such Payment Processing Service Provider may suspend or terminate your PPSP Account at any time in accordance with the PPSP Agreement (as defined below). The information you provide to Podium to facilitate the activation and verification of your PPSP Account must be accurate, current, and complete. Until you have submitted, and Payment Processing Service Provider has reviewed and approved, all required information, your access (if any) to the Payment Processing Services will be on a preliminary, limited basis only, and Podium may terminate your access at any time and for any reason.

3.2 PPSP Agreement. Your use of the Payment Processing Services is conditional upon you accepting the terms and conditions imposed by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider with respect to the aspects of the Payments Service that it facilitates (each a "**PPSP Agreement**"). By submitting Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, you must read and agree to PPSP Agreements of the Payment Processing Service Providers that facilitate the processing of payments. Currently, Podium engages Stripe as a Payment Processing Services Provider, and Stripe’s PPSP Agreement is located at [https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal). The Stripe entity that enters into the PPSP Agreement with you, and the content of your Stripe PPSP Agreement, will depend upon your location. For the avoidance of doubt, Podium is not a party to any PPSP Agreement.

3.3 PPSP Account Management. The PSPP Agreement describes how your PPSP Account will be managed, including (i) the use and administration of any data about you, your Customers, and your Transactions, and (ii) action that may be submitted via your PPSP Account, such as initiating and refunding Transactions, handling disputes and other functions that are or may become available through your PPSP Account. You consent to Podium’s disclosure of your data (which may include Personal Data) to each Payment Processing Service Provider and to each Payment Processing Service Provider’s disclosure of your data (which may include Personal Data) to Podium, as the case may be, for the purpose of facilitating the provision of the Payment Processing Services.

3.4 Responsibility for PPSP Compliance. Podium is not responsible for any non-compliance by any Payment Service Provider with the terms of any PPSP Agreement, any laws, or payment method provider rules, or for the acts or omissions of any Payment Service Provider in providing services to you or your Customers.

3.5 Termination and Suspension by PPSP. If a Payment Processing Service Provider terminates or suspends your PPSP Agreement or PPSP Account, for any reason, Podium may immediately terminate or suspend your use of the Payment Processing Services, without any liability to you.

4. **DATA USE.**

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Payments Service Terms) associated with a dispute after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

By using or accessing Podium’s Payments Service, as defined herein, or by signing or otherwise accepting any Subscription Documentation referencing these terms, you (also referred to as “**Client**”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “**Payments Service Terms**”).

These Payments Service Terms incorporate by this reference the [**Podium Terms of Service**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) which, among other terms, contains provisions governing the resolution of claims (see “Disclaimers”, “Limitations of Liability”, “Dispute Resolution”, “General”). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Payments Service Terms and the Podium Terms of Service, these Payments Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used in these Payments Service Terms without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Payments Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references in the Podium Terms of Service to the “**Agreement**” will include these Payments Service Terms.

1. **DEFINITIONS.**

1.1 **“Payment Processing Services**” means the ability for you to submit, manage, and complete Transactions with your Customers via the Services, and "**Payment Processing Service Providers**" means payment processors that Podium uses to enable the Payment Processing Services.

1.2 “**Payments Service**” means the Payment Processing Services, together with such related functionality as Podium may offer from time to time, as provided by Podium and the Payment Services Providers, and “**Payment Service Providers**” means the third-party service providers used by Podium to facilitate certain features of the Payments Service.

1.4 “**Transaction**” means a request to capture funds for or from a Customer-associated account with respect to a payment from a Customer, and includes the authorization, settlement, and if applicable, disputes, refunds, and reversals, with respect to such payment request.

2\. **SERVICES.**

2.1 Use of the Payments Service. Subject to your performance of your duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide you with access to the Payments Service. Podium will have no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in the Agreement (including any applicable Subscription Documentation).

2.2 Terminal Products. To the extent you use, purchase, or accept any Subscription Documentation that includes any Podium Terminal Products (as defined in the applicable terms), you agree to be bound by the [**Podium Terminal Terms**](https://legal.podium.com/#cardreaders).

2.3 Limited Payment Services. Podium may, from time to time and subject to certain restrictions and/or limitations, make certain limited features of the Payments Service (“**Limited Payment Services**”), such as initiation of a Transaction, available to you on a preliminary basis before you have verified your PPSP Account (as defined below) or linked a valid bank account (“**Client Bank Account**”) to your PPSP Account. If you elect to use these Limited Payments Services prior to verifying your PPSP Account or linking a valid Client Bank Account to your PPSP Account, you understand and agree that you will not be able to complete the Transaction(s), including the settlement and disbursement of corresponding funds unless and until you connect a valid Client Bank Account. Any funds associated with your incomplete Transaction(s) will be considered Unclaimed Funds (as defined below) and will be treated accordingly.

2.4 Stored Credentials. Podium may enable functionality in the Payments Service that allows your Customers to store and reuse payment credentials. Stored credentials may be stored on your behalf, or on your Customer’s behalf. If credentials are stored on your behalf, you may subsequently instruct Podium to initiate a Transaction with that Customer using those credentials, provided that you do so in compliance with: (i) the express consent that you have received from the Customer, as documented in writing; and (ii) these Payments Service Terms and the PPSP Agreement. Podium may decline to process any such Transaction that you initiate until it is satisfied that you have met this compliance obligation. If credentials are stored on behalf of a Customer, then you may not use those credentials to initiate a Transaction without express authorization of the Customer – it is up to the Customer to decide whether to reuse those credentials to complete a Transaction. You are not entitled to use stored credentials other than as specified in this section, and you will never be entitled to directly access or export stored credentials.

2.5. Subscription and Recurring Transactions. If you use the Payment Services for subscription or recurring Transactions you must ensure that you do so in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the payment method for which you are initiating the subscription or recurring Transaction. Without limiting the previous sentence, you must (a) obtain informed consent from Customers before initiating a series of recurring or subscription Transactions, (b) publish and provide Customers with access to a reasonable process by which Customers may cancel recurring or subscription Transactions, and (c) promptly comply with any cancellation request made to you by a Customer (including requests not made via your standard cancellation process).

3. **PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES**

3.1 Account Registration. You may access and fully use the Payment Processing Services only after your Payment Processing Service Provider account (“**PPSP Account**”) has been activated and verified within Podium’s platform. You agree and acknowledge that activation of a PSPP Account is subject to approval by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider, and such Payment Processing Service Provider may suspend or terminate your PPSP Account at any time in accordance with the PPSP Agreement (as defined below). The information you provide to Podium to facilitate the activation and verification of your PPSP Account must be accurate, current, and complete. Until you have submitted, and Payment Processing Service Provider has reviewed and approved, all required information, your access (if any) to the Payment Processing Services will be on a preliminary, limited basis only, and Podium may terminate your access at any time and for any reason.

3.2 PPSP Agreement. Your use of the Payment Processing Services is conditional upon you accepting the terms and conditions imposed by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider with respect to the aspects of the Payments Service that it facilitates (each a "**PPSP Agreement**"). By submitting Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, you must read and agree to PPSP Agreements of the Payment Processing Service Providers that facilitate the processing of payments. Currently, Podium engages Stripe as a Payment Processing Services Provider, and Stripe’s PPSP Agreement is located at [https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal). The Stripe entity that enters into the PPSP Agreement with you, and the content of your Stripe PPSP Agreement, will depend upon your location. For the avoidance of doubt, Podium is not a party to any PPSP Agreement.

3.3 PPSP Account Management. The PSPP Agreement describes how your PPSP Account will be managed, including (i) the use and administration of any data about you, your Customers, and your Transactions, and (ii) action that may be submitted via your PPSP Account, such as initiating and refunding Transactions, handling disputes and other functions that are or may become available through your PPSP Account. You consent to Podium’s disclosure of your data (which may include Personal Data) to each Payment Processing Service Provider and to each Payment Processing Service Provider’s disclosure of your data (which may include Personal Data) to Podium, as the case may be, for the purpose of facilitating the provision of the Payment Processing Services.

3.4 Responsibility for PPSP Compliance.

7. **FEES, SETTLEMENT & PAYOUT SCHEDULE**

7.1 Fees. In addition to any other Fees due to Podium under the Subscription Documentation, Client will pay a fee assessed on a per Transaction basis (“**Transaction Fee**”) and any additional fees for additional features within the Payments Service which may be made available by Podium from time to time (including, if applicable, a fee for use of the Premium Fraud Protection Service)(the Transaction Fees, together with the additional fees (if any), are “**Payments Service Fees**”, which form part of the Fees, as that term is defined in the Podium Terms of Service).

7.2 Determining Fees. Fees are set by Podium in its sole discretion, and Fees are payable in accordance with these Payments Service Terms, the Podium Terms of Service, and your applicable Subscription Documentation. If no Payments Service Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, your use of the Payments Service will be subject to Podium’s then-current rates, available at the [**Podium Pricing Page**](https://www.podium.com/pricing/) (for rates applicable to clients located in Australia, please contact us [here](https://www.podium.com.au/contact-us/)). Podium may revise the Payments Service Fees at any time, by providing notice to Client, with the change in Fees effective thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable notice. In addition to the Fees, you must reimburse Podium for any liabilities incurred by Podium as a result of your use of the Payments Service in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or a PPSP Agreement, including penalties and fines. You agree that Podium will have the right to deduct the applicable Fees (including the Payments Service Fees) and any amounts otherwise due to Podium from your PPSP Account. If your PPSP Account balance is insufficient, Podium may debit the Client Bank Account to recover owed amounts.

7.3 Settlement. Podium will arrange to settle Transaction funds to your Client Bank Account in accordance with the Payout Schedule (defined below).

If we exercise our right to withhold the settlement of funds for any reason, we will communicate the general reason for withholding the funds and give you a timeline and description of the preconditions that must be satisfied for releasing the funds. Additionally, if a refund or reversal is processed for any Transaction you complete using the Payments Service, you understand and agree that the initial Transaction Fees for the related Transaction will not be refunded back to you.

7.4 Payout Schedule. In your Podium dashboard, Podium will specify the frequency of payouts of your balance to your Client Bank Account (“**Payout Schedule**”). The Payout schedule may vary depending on your Podium Account type, and Podium may delay or withhold a payout, notwithstanding the Payout Schedule, if Podium is entitled to do so under this Agreement. The Payout Schedule refers to the time at which Podium will attempt to initiate a payout, and Podium will not be responsible for any nonconformance with the Payout Schedule due to the acts or omissions of any third party (e.g., a telecommunications provider or financial institution). The payout amount may also take some time to appear in your Client Bank Account balance, due to the operation of systems outside of Podium’s control.

7.5 Reserve. If Podium determines your use of the Payments Service exposes or is likely to expose Podium to liability, Podium may set an amount of funds that Podium will hold to offset this risk (“**Reserve**”). Podium may fund the Reserve from your PSPP Account balance, from funds that you provide, or by debiting the Client Bank Account, and Podium may use the Reserve to offset any amounts that you owe Podium. A failure to fund a Reserve as required by Podium will constitute a breach of this Agreement, and Podium may hold the Reserve until Podium determines that it is no longer necessary.

If you leave any funds dormant in a PPSP Account, or if you do not link and/or maintain a link to a valid Client Bank Account, you may have a balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under applicable law (“**Unclaimed Funds**”). In such an event, Podium may be required by law to deliver the Unclaimed Funds to various government agencies. To the extent required by applicable law, Podium will give you notice if we hold Unclaimed Funds payable to you in an account beyond the applicable dormancy period for abandoned property.

This information may include information about you, your Payment Provider Account, your Customers, and Transactions made through your use of Payment the Services.

8.2 Podium may also suspend your access to and/or use of the Payments Service, your PPSP Account, and your access to funds in your account, or terminate this Agreement, at any time if you are in breach of this Agreement, a PPSP Agreement, or Podium believes that your continued use of the Payments Service creates, or is likely to create a risk of harm to Podium, a Customer, or any other third party.

8.3 Termination of the Payments Service Terms means that you will no longer be authorized to access the Payments Service, which includes the ability to submit Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, however, termination will not affect your continued liability with respect to Transactions that you submit prior to date of termination.

7. **FEES, SETTLEMENT & PAYOUT SCHEDULE**

7.1 Fees. In addition to any other Fees due to Podium under the Subscription Documentation, Client will pay a fee assessed on a per Transaction basis (“**Transaction Fee**”) and any additional fees for additional features within the Payments Service which may be made available by Podium from time to time (including, if applicable, a fee for use of the Premium Fraud Protection Service)(the Transaction Fees, together with the additional fees (if any), are “**Payments Service Fees**”, which form part of the Fees, as that term is defined in the Podium Terms of Service).

7.2 Determining Fees. Fees are set by Podium in its sole discretion, and Fees are payable in accordance with these Payments Service Terms, the Podium Terms of Service, and your applicable Subscription Documentation. If no Payments Service Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, your use of the Payments Service will be subject to Podium’s then-current rates, available at the [**Podium Pricing Page**](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Podium may revise the Payments Service Fees at any time, by providing notice to Client, with the change in Fees effective thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable notice. In addition to the Fees, you must reimburse Podium for any liabilities incurred by Podium as a result of your use of the Payments Service in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or a PPSP Agreement, including penalties and fines. You agree that Podium will have the right to deduct the applicable Fees (including the Payments Service Fees) and any amounts otherwise due to Podium from your PPSP Account. If your PPSP Account balance is insufficient, Podium may debit the Client Bank Account to recover owed amounts.

7.3 Settlement. Podium will arrange to settle Transaction funds to your Client Bank Account in accordance with the Payout Schedule (defined below). You affirm that the account you designate as your Client Bank Account for the purposes of this agreement is: (i) owned by you, and (ii) titled in your legal name or trade name. You also affirm that you are authorized to initiate settlements to and debits from the Client Bank Account you designate. You also agree that Podium has the right to withhold settlement to your Client Bank Account if we reasonably determine that we have incurred or may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, or other legal risks associated with your use of the Payments Service. If we exercise our right to withhold the settlement of funds for any reason, we will communicate the general reason for withholding the funds and give you a timeline and description of the preconditions that must be satisfied for releasing the funds.

7.4 Payout Schedule. In your Podium dashboard, Podium will specify the frequency of payouts of your balance to your Client Bank Account (“**Payout Schedule**”). The Payout schedule may vary depending on your Podium Account type, and Podium may delay or withhold a payout, notwithstanding the Payout Schedule, if Podium is entitled to do so under this Agreement. The Payout Schedule refers to the time at which Podium will attempt to initiate a payout, and Podium will not be responsible for any nonconformance with the Payout Schedule due to the acts or omissions of any third party (e.g., a telecommunications provider or financial institution). The payout amount may also take some time to appear in your Client Bank Account balance, due to the operation of systems outside of Podium’s control.

7.5 Reserve. If Podium determines your use of the Payments Service exposes or is likely to expose Podium to liability, Podium may set an amount of funds that Podium will hold to offset this risk (“**Reserve**”). Podium may fund the Reserve from your PSPP Account balance, from funds that you provide, or by debiting the Client Bank Account, and Podium may use the Reserve to offset any amounts that you owe Podium. A failure to fund a Reserve as required by Podium will constitute a breach of this Agreement, and Podium may hold the Reserve until Podium determines that it is no longer necessary.

7.6 Unclaimed Funds or Dormant Accounts. If you leave any funds dormant in a PPSP Account, or if you do not link and/or maintain a link to a valid Client Bank Account, you may have a balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under applicable law (“**Unclaimed Funds**”). In such an event, Podium may be required by law to deliver the Unclaimed Funds to various government agencies. To the extent required by applicable law, Podium will give you notice if we hold Unclaimed Funds payable to you in an account beyond the applicable dormancy period for abandoned property. If Podium or the Payment Processing Service Provider are unable to contact you, we will treat the Unclaimed Funds in your PPSP Account as abandoned and will deliver them to the appropriate government authority.

8. **SUSPENSION & TERMINATION**

8.1 Podium may refuse, condition, or suspend any Transactions that we believe: (i) may violate this Agreement; (ii) are unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal; or (iii) expose you, Podium, or others to risks unacceptable to Podium. If we suspect or know that you are using or have used the Payments Service for unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal purposes, we may share any information related to such activity with the appropriate financial institution, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency consistent with our legal obligations. This information may include information about you, your Payment Provider Account, your Customers, and Transactions made through your use of Payment the Services.

8.2 Podium may also suspend your access to and/or use of the Payments Service, your PPSP Account, and your access to funds in your account, or terminate this Agreement, at any time if you are in breach of this Agreement, a PPSP Agreement, or Podium believes that your continued use of the Payments Service creates, or is likely to create a risk of harm to Podium, a Customer, or any other third party.

8.3 Termination of the Payments Service Terms means that you will no longer be authorized to access the Payments Service, which includes the ability to submit Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, however termination will not affect your continued liability with respect to Transactions that you submit prior to date of termination.

9. **LIMITATIONS ON PODIUM’S LIABILITY**

9.1 Podium is not responsible for Client’s obligations to its Customers (including properly describing and delivering the goods or services being sold to Customers). You are solely responsible for, and Podium expressly disclaims all liability for, your compliance with applicable laws and obligations related to your provision of the goods or services to your Customers. This may include providing customer service, notification and handling of refunds or Customer complaints, provision of receipts, registering your legal entity, or other actions not related to the Services. You agree to indemnify Podium for any losses we incur based on your failure to properly describe or deliver goods or services, or comply with your legal or contractual obligations to Payment Service Provider or your Customers.

9.2 This Section is in addition to, and does not limit in any way, the risk allocation provisions of the Podium Service Terms.

Additional Services are Payments Services that are subject to additional terms and conditions, and you accept the relevant additional terms and conditions when you use an Additional Service.

If no Payments Service Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, your use of the Payments Service will be subject to Podium’s then-current rates, available at the [**Podium Pricing Page**](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Podium may revise the Payments Service Fees at any time, by providing notice to Client, with the change in Fees effective thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable notice. In addition to the Fees, you must reimburse Podium for any liabilities incurred by Podium as a result of your use of the Payments Service in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or a PPSP Agreement, including penalties and fines. You agree that Podium will have the right to deduct the applicable Fees (including the Payments Service Fees) and any amounts otherwise due to Podium from your PPSP Account. If your PPSP Account balance is insufficient, Podium may debit the Client Bank Account to recover owed amounts.

7.3 Settlement. Podium will arrange to settle Transaction funds to your Client Bank Account in accordance with the Payout Schedule (defined below). You affirm that the account you designate as your Client Bank Account for the purposes of this agreement is: (i) owned by you, and (ii) titled in your legal name or trade name. You also affirm that you are authorized to initiate settlements to and debits from the Client Bank Account you designate. You also agree that Podium has the right to withhold settlement to your Client Bank Account if we reasonably determine that we have incurred or may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, or other legal risks associated with your use of the Payments Service. If we exercise our right to withhold the settlement of funds for any reason, we will communicate the general reason for withholding the funds and give you a timeline and description of the preconditions that must be satisfied for releasing the funds.

7.4 Payout Schedule. In your Podium dashboard, Podium will specify the frequency of payouts of your balance to your Client Bank Account (“**Payout Schedule**”). The Payout schedule may vary depending on your Podium Account type, and Podium may delay or withhold a payout, notwithstanding the Payout Schedule, if Podium is entitled to do so under this Agreement. The Payout Schedule refers to the time at which Podium will attempt to initiate a payout, and Podium will not be responsible for any nonconformance with the Payout Schedule due to the acts or omissions of any third party (e.g., a telecommunications provider or financial institution). The payout amount may also take some time to appear in your Client Bank Account balance, due to the operation of systems outside of Podium’s control.

7.5 Reserve. If Podium determines your use of the Payments Service exposes or is likely to expose Podium to liability, Podium may set an amount of funds that Podium will hold to offset this risk (“**Reserve**”). Podium may fund the Reserve from your PSPP Account balance, from funds that you provide, or by debiting the Client Bank Account, and Podium may use the Reserve to offset any amounts that you owe Podium. A failure to fund a Reserve as required by Podium will constitute a breach of this Agreement, and Podium may hold the Reserve until Podium determines that it is no longer necessary.

7.6 Unclaimed Funds or Dormant Accounts. If you leave any funds dormant in a PPSP Account, or if you do not link and/or maintain a link to a valid Client Bank Account, you may have a balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under applicable law (“**Unclaimed Funds**”). In such an event, Podium may be required by law to deliver the Unclaimed Funds to various government agencies. To the extent required by applicable law, Podium will give you notice if we hold Unclaimed Funds payable to you in an account beyond the applicable dormancy period for abandoned property. If Podium or the Payment Processing Service Provider are unable to contact you, we will treat the Unclaimed Funds in your PPSP Account as abandoned and will deliver them to the appropriate government authority.

8. **SUSPENSION & TERMINATION**

8.1 Podium may refuse, condition, or suspend any Transactions that we believe: (i) may violate this Agreement; (ii) are unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal; or (iii) expose you, Podium, or others to risks unacceptable to Podium. If we suspect or know that you are using or have used the Payments Service for unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal purposes, we may share any information related to such activity with the appropriate financial institution, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency consistent with our legal obligations. This information may include information about you, your Payment Provider Account, your Customers, and Transactions made through your use of Payment the Services.

8.2 Podium may also suspend your access to and/or use of the Payments Service, your PPSP Account, and your access to funds in your account, or terminate this Agreement, at any time if you are in breach of this Agreement, a PPSP Agreement, or Podium believes that your continued use of the Payments Service creates, or is likely to create a risk of harm to Podium, a Customer, or any other third party.

8.3 Termination of the Payments Service Terms means that you will no longer be authorized to access the Payments Service, which includes the ability to submit Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, however termination will not affect your continued liability with respect to Transactions that you submit prior to date of termination.

9. **LIMITATIONS ON PODIUM’S LIABILITY**

9.1 Podium is not responsible for Client’s obligations to its Customers (including properly describing and delivering the goods or services being sold to Customers).

By using or accessing Podium’s Payments Service, as defined herein, or by signing or otherwise accepting any Subscription Documentation referencing these terms, you (also referred to as “**Client**”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “**Payments Service Terms**”).

These Payments Service Terms incorporate by this reference the [**Podium Terms of Service**](https://www.podium.com/terms-and-conditions/) which, among other terms, contains provisions governing the resolution of claims (see “Disclaimers”, “Limitations of Liability”, “Dispute Resolution”, “General”). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Payments Service Terms and the Podium Terms of Service, these Payments Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used in these Payments Service Terms without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Payments Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references in the Podium Terms of Service to the “**Agreement**” will include these Payments Service Terms.

1. **DEFINITIONS.**

1.1 **“Payment Processing Services**” means the ability for you to submit, manage, and complete Transactions with your Customers via the Services.

1.2 “**Payment Service Providers**” means the third-party service providers used by Podium to facilitate certain features of the Payments Service, including payment processors (“Payment Processing Service Providers”), which as of the date of these Payments Service Terms includes Stripe, Inc., and fraud protection service providers. Podium may add or remove Payment Service Providers from time to time.

1.3 “**Payments Service**” means the Payment Processing Services, together with such related functionality as Podium may offer from time to time.

1.4 “**Personal Data**” means information about an identifiable individual, or information that is capable of being used (along or in combination with other information) to identify an individual, (not a company, legal entity, or machine) and is transmitted to or accessible through the Services.

1.5 “**Transaction**” means a request initiated by Client via the Payments Service for which Client directs Podium to capture funds for or from a Customer-associated account with respect to a payment from a Customer, and includes the authorization, settlement, and if applicable, disputes, refunds, and reversals, with respect to such payment request.

2\. **SERVICES.**

2.1 Use of the Payments Service. Subject to your performance of your duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide you with access to the Payments Service. Podium will have no obligation to provide any services or perform any tasks not specifically set forth in the Agreement (including any applicable Subscription Documentation).

2.2 Terminal Products. To the extent you use, purchase, or accept any Subscription Documentation that includes any Podium Terminal Products (as defined in the applicable terms), you agree to be bound by the [**Podium Terminal Terms**](https://www.podium.com/terms-and-conditions/card-readers).

2.3 Limited Payment Services. Podium may, from time to time and subject to certain restrictions and/or limitations, make certain limited features of its Payments Service (“**Limited Payment Services**”), such as initiation of a Transaction, available to you on a preliminary basis before you have verified your PPSP Account or linked a valid bank account (“**Client Bank Account**”) to your PPSP Account. If you elect to use these Limited Payments Services prior to verifying your PPSP Account or linking a valid Client Bank Account to your PPSP Account, you understand and agree that Podium will not be able to complete the Transaction(s), including the settlement and disbursement of corresponding funds unless and until you connect a valid Client Bank Account. Any funds associated with your incomplete Transaction(s) will be considered Unclaimed Funds (as defined below) and will be treated accordingly.

2.4 Stored Credentials. Podium may enable functionality in the Payments Service that allows your Customers to store and reuse payment credentials. Stored credentials may be stored on your behalf, or on your Customer’s behalf. If credentials are stored on your behalf, you may subsequently instruct Podium to initiate a Transaction with that Customer using those credentials, provided that you do so in compliance with: (i) the express consent that you have received from the Customer, as documented in writing; and (ii) these Payments Service Terms and the PPSP Agreement. Podium may decline to process any such Transaction that you initiate until it is satisfied that you have met this compliance obligation. If credentials are stored on behalf of a Customer, then you may not use those credentials to initiate a Transaction – it is up to the Customer to decide whether to reuse those credentials to complete a Transaction. You are not entitled to use stored credentials other than as specified in this section, and you will never be entitled to directly access or export stored credentials.

3. **PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES**

3.1 Account Registration. Client may access and fully use the Payment Processing Services only after a Payment Processing Service Provider account (“**PPSP Account**”) for Client has been activated and verified within Podium’s platform.

If credentials are stored on behalf of a Customer, then you may not use those credentials to initiate a Transaction – it is up to the Customer to decide whether to reuse those credentials to complete a Transaction. You are not entitled to use stored credentials other than as specified in this section, and you will never be entitled to directly access or export stored credentials.

3. **PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES**

3.1 Account Registration. Client may access and fully use the Payment Processing Services only after a Payment Processing Service Provider account (“**PPSP Account**”) for Client has been activated and verified within Podium’s platform. You agree and acknowledge that activation of a PSPP Account is subject to approval by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider, and such Payment Processing Service Provider may suspend or terminate your PPSP Account at any time in accordance with the PPSP Agreement (as defined below). The information you provide to Podium to facilitate the activation and verification of your PPSP Account must be accurate, current, and complete. Until you have submitted, and Payment Processing Service Provider has reviewed and approved, all required information, your access (if any) to the Payment Processing Services will be on a preliminary, limited basis only, and Podium may terminate your access at any time and for any reason.

3.2 PPSP Agreement. Your use of the Payment Processing Services is conditional upon you accepting the terms and conditions imposed by the relevant Payment Processing Service Provider with respect to the aspects of the Payments Service that it facilitates (each a "**PPSP Agreement**"). By submitting Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, you must read and agree to PPSP Agreements of the Payment Processing Service Providers that facilitate the processing of payments. Currently, Podium uses Stripe, Inc. to enable the Payment Processing Services, and Stripe’s PPSP Agreement is located at [https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal). For the avoidance of doubt, Podium is not a party to any PPSP Agreement.

3.3 PPSP Account Management. This Agreement describes how your PPSP Account will be managed, including (i) the use and administration of any data about you, your Customers, or your Transactions that is provided to Podium, and (ii) action that may be submitted via Podium and your PPSP Account, such as initiating charges or refunds, handling chargebacks or disputes, and other functions that are or may become available through your PPSP Account. You consent to Podium’s disclosure of data (which may include Personal Data) to each Payment Processing Service Provider and to each Payment Processing Service Provider’s disclosure of data (which may include Personal Data) to Podium, as the case may be, for the purpose of facilitating the provision of the Payment Processing Services.

3.4 Responsibility for PPSP Compliance. Podium is not responsible for any non-compliance by Payment Service Provider with the terms of any PPSP Agreement, any laws, or payment method provider rules, or for the acts or omissions of any Payment Service Provider in providing services to you or your Customers.

3.5 Termination and Suspension by PPSP. If a Payment Processing Service Provider terminates or suspends your PPSP Agreement or PPSP Account, for any reason, Podium may immediately terminate or suspend your use of the Payment Processing Services, without any liability to you.

4. **DATA USE.**

4.1 In addition to the Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of the Payments Service, Client grants Podium and its affiliates the worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s third party service providers) in order to provide the Payments Service to Client and (ii) to enable Podium to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Payments Service; (b) mitigate fraud, financial loss, or other harm; (c) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, Podium’s products, systems, and tools.

4.2 Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Payments Service Terms) associated with a chargeback after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation. Solely for purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civil Code § 1798.100 et seq. (as may be amended from time to time) (the “**CCPA**”), (i) Podium is acting as a Service Provider (as defined in the CCPA) for Client as a Business (as defined in the CCPA), (ii) except as set forth herein, Podium is prohibited from selling the Client Data or retaining, using, or disclosing the Client Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Payments Service, (iii) Client hereby instructs Podium that the Business Purpose includes Podium (and its service providers) using and retaining the Client Data internally for the benefit of all of Podium’s clients, including detecting fraud, optimizing e-commerce solutions and similar performance enhancing purposes, and (iv) Podium understands and will comply with the restrictions herein.

6. **REQUIREMENTS, LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS**

6.1 Compliance with Laws. You must use the Payments Service in a lawful manner, and must obey all laws, rules, and regulations (“**Laws**”) applicable to your use of the Payments Service.

6.2 Prohibited Businesses. You may not use the Payments Service to enable any person (including you) to benefit from any activities Podium (or Payment Service Provider) has identified as a restricted business or activity (“**Prohibited Businesses**”), including those businesses listed in the [**Podium Acceptable Use Policy**](https://www.podium.com/acceptable-use-policy/) and the [**Stripe Restricted Business List**](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), as well as any pornography, gambling, and/or firearms related businesses, activities, or transactions. “Prohibited Businesses” also includes any country, organization, entity, or person embargoed or blocked by any government, including those on sanctions lists identified by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). If you are uncertain whether a category of business or activity is restricted or have questions about how these restrictions apply to you, please contact Podium.

6.3 Other Restricted Uses. You may not use the Payments Service to facilitate illegal Transactions or to permit others to use the Payments Service for personal, family, or household purposes. In addition, you may not allow, and may not allow others to: (i) access or attempt to access non-public systems, programs, data, or services; (ii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell, or distribute in any way, any data, content, or any part of the Payments Service, documentation, or Podium’s website except as expressly permitted by applicable Laws; (iii) act as service bureau or pass-through agent for the PPSP Account with no added value to your Customers; (iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (v) work around any of the technical limitations of the Payments Service or enable functionality that is disabled or prohibited; (vi) reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer the Payments Service except as expressly permitted by Laws; (vii) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the normal operation of the Payments Service or affect use by Podium’s other users; or (ix) impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the Payments Service.

7. **FEES, SETTLEMENT & PAYOUT SCHEDULE**

7.1 Fees. In addition to any other Fees due to Podium under the Subscription Documentation, Client will pay a fee assessed on a per Transaction basis (“**Transaction Fee**”) and any additional fees for additional features within the Payments Service which may be made available by Podium from time to time (including, if applicable, a fee for use of the Premium Fraud Protection Service)(the Transaction Fees, together with the additional fees (if any), are “**Payments Service Fees**”, which form part of the Fees, as that term is defined in the Podium Terms of Service).

7.2 Determining Fees. Fees are set by Podium in its sole discretion, and Fees are payable in accordance with these Payments Service Terms, the Podium Terms of Service, and your applicable Subscription Documentation. If no Payments Service Fees are specified on your Subscription Documentation, your use of the Payments Service will be subject to Podium’s then-current rates, available at the [**Podium Pricing Page**](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Podium may revise the Payments Service Fees at any time, by providing notice to Client, with the change in Fees effective thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable notice. In addition to the Fees, you must reimburse Podium for any liabilities incurred by Podium as a result of your use of the Payments Service in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or a PPSP Agreement, including penalties and fines. You agree that Podium will have the right to deduct the applicable Fees (including the Payments Service Fees) and any amounts otherwise due to Podium from your PPSP Account. If your PPSP Account balance is insufficient, Podium may debit the Client Bank Account to recover owed amounts.

7.3 Settlement. Podium will arrange to settle Transaction funds to your Client Bank Account in accordance with the Payout Schedule (defined below). You affirm that the account you designate as your Client Bank Account for the purposes of this agreement is: (i) owned by you, and (ii) titled in your legal name or trade name. You also affirm that you are authorized to initiate settlements to and debits from the Client Bank Account you designate. You also agree that Podium has the right to withhold settlement to your Client Bank Account if we reasonably determine that we have incurred or may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, or other legal risks associated with your use of the Payments Service. If we exercise our right to withhold the settlement of funds for any reason, we will communicate the general reason for withholding the funds and give you a timeline and description of the preconditions that must be satisfied for releasing the funds.

7.4 Payout Schedule. In your Podium dashboard, Podium will specify the frequency of payouts of your balance to your Client Bank Account (“**Payout Schedule**”). The Payout schedule may vary depending on your Podium Account type, and Podium may delay or withhold a payout, notwithstanding the Payout Schedule, if Podium is entitled to do so under this Agreement. The Payout Schedule refers to the time at which Podium will attempt to initiate a payout, and Podium will not be responsible for any nonconformance with the Payout Schedule due to the acts or omissions of any third party (e.g., a telecommunications provider or financial institution). The payout amount may also take some time to appear in your Client Bank Account balance, due to the operation of systems outside of Podium’s control.

7.5 Reserve. If Podium determines your use of the Payments Service exposes or is likely to expose Podium to liability, Podium may set an amount of funds that Podium will hold to offset this risk (“**Reserve**”). Podium may fund the Reserve from your PSPP Account balance, from funds that you provide, or by debiting the Client Bank Account, and Podium may use the Reserve to offset any amounts that you owe Podium. A failure to fund a Reserve as required by Podium will constitute a breach of this Agreement, and Podium may hold the Reserve until Podium determines that it is no longer necessary.

7.6 Unclaimed Funds or Dormant Accounts. If you leave any funds dormant in a PPSP Account, or if you do not link and/or maintain a link to a valid Client Bank Account, you may have a balance that is deemed “unclaimed” or “abandoned” under applicable law (“**Unclaimed Funds**”). In such an event, Podium may be required by law to deliver the Unclaimed Funds to various government agencies. To the extent required by applicable law, Podium will give you notice if we hold Unclaimed Funds payable to you in an account beyond the applicable dormancy period for abandoned property. If Podium or the Payment Processing Service Provider are unable to contact you, we will treat the Unclaimed Funds in your PPSP Account as abandoned and will deliver them to the appropriate government authority.

8. **SUSPENSION & TERMINATION**

8.1 Podium may refuse, condition, or suspend any Transactions that we believe: (i) may violate this Agreement; (ii) are unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal; or (iii) expose you, Podium, or others to risks unacceptable to Podium. If we suspect or know that you are using or have used the Payments Service for unauthorized, fraudulent, or illegal purposes, we may share any information related to such activity with the appropriate financial institution, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency consistent with our legal obligations. This information may include information about you, your Payment Provider Account, your Customers, and Transactions made through your use of Payment the Services.

8.2 Podium may also suspend your access to and/or use of the Payments Service, your PPSP Account, and your access to funds in your account, or terminate this Agreement, at any time if you are in breach of this Agreement, a PPSP Agreement, or Podium believes that your continued use of the Payments Service creates, or is likely to create a risk of harm to Podium, a Customer, or any other third party.

8.3 Termination of the Payments Service Terms means that you will no longer be authorized to access the Payments Service, which includes the ability to submit Transactions via the Payment Processing Services, however termination will not affect your continued liability with respect to Transactions that you submit prior to date of termination.

9. **LIMITATIONS ON PODIUM’S LIABILITY**

9.1 Podium is not responsible for Client’s obligations to its Customers (including properly describing and delivering the goods or services being sold to Customers). You are solely responsible for, and Podium expressly disclaims all liability for, your compliance with applicable laws and obligations related to your provision of the goods or services to your Customers. This may include providing customer service, notification and handling of refunds or Customer complaints, provision of receipts, registering your legal entity, or other actions not related to the Services. You agree to indemnify Podium for any losses we incur based on your failure to properly describe or deliver goods or services, or comply with your legal or contractual obligations to Payment Service Provider or your Customers.

9.2 This Section is in addition to, and does not limit in any way, the risk allocation provisions of the Podium Service Terms.

10. **ADDITIONAL SERVICES**

10.1 From time to time, Podium may offer Services that supplement the Payments Service (“**Additional Services**”). Additional Services are Payments Services that are subject to additional terms and conditions, and you accept the relevant additional terms and conditions when you use an Additional Service.

Updates to the Payments Service Terms
=====================================

(For Australian Clients)

* **General Updates:**
    * In an effort to simplify Podium’s Terms for all Podium Clients, we have created a consolidated set of Payments Service Terms for all Payments users. This document, along with our main Terms of Service, incorporates key elements from our prior terms into one place.
    * As part of this consolidation, we have updated certain language and definitions to provide better clarity, and we have reformatted certain sections and numbering to improve overall structure and readability.
    * These updated Terms also include language relating to certain features that are not currently available in Australia (including Terminal Products, Premium Fraud Protection, and Stripe Capital). These terms, therefore, do not apply to Australia-based Clients.

7\. Privacy and Security.

a. Client Agreement and Privacy Policy.

(i) Client Agreement. Before you access or use any Client Data or any Client Account (other than your own if you are a Client using the Podium API on your own behalf), you must, by way of a legally valid Client Agreement, obtain all necessary permissions, authorizations, and consents from each Client or end user, as the case may be, to access and use their Client Account and Client Data via the Podium API, your Application, and services. The Client Agreement for each Client must include provisions that are at least as protective as those contained in this Agreement. The Client Agreement must also include provisions informing the Client that:

(A) Podium will not be responsible for any support or assistance relating to your Application or services (unless Podium has expressly stated otherwise in writing);

(B) You, not Podium, are solely responsible for your Application, your related services, and for any liability or damages that arise out of a Client’s authorized use of the Application; and

(C) The provisions of your Client Agreement govern the scope of your access and use rights with respect to the Client’s Data and Account.

(ii) Privacy Policy. You must maintain, and your Application must display, a legally compliant privacy policy detailing the data and information you’ll collect from any Client or user when they use your Application, and you agree that you will only use such data and information as expressly authorized by the Client in each case.

(iii) Protected Health Information. To the extent you or your Application or services will access or use any Client Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as that term is defined under HIPAA, you represent and warrant that you will execute a legally valid Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”) with each applicable Client prior to using or accessing their PHI via the Podium API and your Application. You will only use such data as authorized under the BAA and HIPAA and will remain fully liable for any violations with respect to PHI.

b. Security. You will implement and maintain a security program designed to prevent the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of any of the data you access or use via the Podium API and in developing, implementing, and distributing your Application and related services. Your security program must include appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that meet or exceed industry standards, according to the nature and scope of the data you use or access via the Podium API, and which is. You will also ensure that any subcontractor you use in relation to the Podium API also agrees to comply with this provision. You also represent and warrant that any Applications you develop or distribute using the Podium API or Podium Marketplace will not contain any security vulnerabilities. If you are using the Podium API for security testing purposes, you also agree that you will adhere to Podium’s testing policy outlined in our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.podium.com/vulnerability-policy/).

(i) Data Breach and Notification. In the event of any actual or suspected unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss, or processing of Podium Data or Client Data (“Data Breach”) you will notify Podium in writing immediately (but no later than twenty-four (24) hours) upon discovering the Data Breach. Upon becoming aware of any Data Breach, you will, at your own expense, work to immediately mitigate the effects of the Data Breach, correct any flaws or deficiencies that contributed to the Data Breach, and cooperate fully with Podium, including providing any and all information Podium requests relating to the Data Breach. You will also, at your own expense, provide all notifications to Clients, end users, and any other parties affected by the Data Breach as required by law and your contractual obligations to the affected parties.

8\. Confidentiality

a. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 14(f), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 8 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

b. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

c. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

11\. Limitations of Liability.

a. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. You may not assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of Podium, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 14(a) will be null and void.

b. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement only permits use by you and the legal entity or entities you represent and is binding to this Agreement and not any affiliates. Furthermore, your affiliates are not permitted to use the Podium API under this Agreement unless that affiliate agrees to this Agreement individually and receives its own access to the Podium API.

c. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. You must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include "Attn. Legal Department" in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the email address(es) on record for your account or as otherwise provided by you to Podium. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Podium API or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website. You hereby consent to receipt of electronic notices and agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications.

d. Modifications. Podium may update or modify these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights and obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms, or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you will no longer have the right to use the API. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waiver must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

e. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, void or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

f. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement.

g. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

h. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except applicable payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

i. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

j. Injunctive Relief. You understand and agree that the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Podium or Client Data you access or use via the Podium API or Podium Platform may cause irreparable harm to Podium or our Clients. You therefore agree that Podium will have the right to obtain an immediate injunction against any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, as well as the right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a breach.

k. Non-Waiver. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

l. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including any terms, policies, or documents referenced or linked to herein, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium API or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement.

7\. Privacy and Security.

a. Client Agreement and Privacy Policy.

(i) Client Agreement. Before you access or use any Client Data or any Client Account (other than your own if you are a Client using the Podium API on your own behalf), you must, by way of a legally valid Client Agreement, obtain all necessary permissions, authorizations, and consents from each Client or end user, as the case may be, to access and use their Client Account and Client Data via the Podium API, your Application, and services. The Client Agreement for each Client must include provisions that are at least as protective as those contained in this Agreement. The Client Agreement must also include provisions informing the Client that:

(A) Podium will not be responsible for any support or assistance relating to your Application or services (unless Podium has expressly stated otherwise in writing);

(B) You, not Podium, are solely responsible for your Application, your related services, and for any liability or damages that arise out of a Client’s authorized use of the Application; and

(C) The provisions of your Client Agreement govern the scope of your access and use rights with respect to the Client’s Data and Account.

(ii) Privacy Policy. You must maintain, and your Application must display, a legally compliant privacy policy detailing the data and information you’ll collect from any Client or user when they use your Application, and you agree that you will only use such data and information as expressly authorized by the Client in each case.

(iii) Protected Health Information. To the extent you or your Application or services will access or use any Client Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as that term is defined under HIPAA, you represent and warrant that you will execute a legally valid Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”) with each applicable Client prior to using or accessing their PHI via the Podium API and your Application. You will only use such data as authorized under the BAA and HIPAA and will remain fully liable for any violations with respect to PHI.

b. Security. You will implement and maintain a security program designed to prevent the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of any of the data you access or use via the Podium API and in developing, implementing, and distributing your Application and related services. Your security program must include appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that meet or exceed industry standards, according to the nature and scope of the data you use or access via the Podium API, and which is. You will also ensure that any subcontractor you use in relation to the Podium API also agrees to comply with this provision. You also represent and warrant that any Applications you develop or distribute using the Podium API or Podium Marketplace will not contain any security vulnerabilities. If you are using the Podium API for security testing purposes, you also agree that you will adhere to Podium’s testing policy outlined in our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.podium.com/vulnerability-policy/).

(i) Data Breach and Notification. In the event of any actual or suspected unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss, or processing of Podium Data or Client Data (“Data Breach”) you will notify Podium in writing immediately (but no later than twenty-four (24) hours) upon discovering the Data Breach. Upon becoming aware of any Data Breach, you will, at your own expense, work to immediately mitigate the effects of the Data Breach, correct any flaws or deficiencies that contributed to the Data Breach, and cooperate fully with Podium, including providing any and all information Podium requests relating to the Data Breach. You will also, at your own expense, provide all notifications to Clients, end users, and any other parties affected by the Data Breach as required by law and your contractual obligations to the affected parties.

(ii) Deletion. Except as necessary to comply with your obligations under applicable law, you must immediately delete all Client Data: (a) upon request from the Client; and (b) upon termination of this Agreement or revocation of your access to the Podium API.

  

8\. Confidentiality

a. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 14(f), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 8 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

b. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

c. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

In the event we assume control of the defense of such claim, we will not settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval.

  

11\. Limitations of Liability.

b. Termination. We may immediately terminate or suspend this Agreement, any rights granted herein, and/or your licenses under this Agreement, in our sole discretion at any time and for any reason, by providing notice to you or revoking access to the Podium API and the Podium Marks. In addition, this Agreement will terminate immediately and automatically without any notice if you violate any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing your access to and use of the Podium API and Podium Marks.

c. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason all licenses and rights granted to you under this Agreement will also terminate and you must cease using, destroy, and permanently erase from all devices and systems you directly or indirectly control all copies of the Podium API, Podium Marks, and other Podium Confidential Information, as well as any and all Client Data or Customer Data then in your possession or control. You must also immediately cease: (a) your use and access to the Podium API, Podium Marks, and Podium Platform; and (b) your distribution and/or provision your Application. Upon request from Podium or a Client, as applicable, you will also provide written certification of your compliance with this section. Any terms that by their nature are intended to continue beyond the termination or expiration of this Agreement will survive termination. Termination will not limit any of Podium's rights or remedies at law or in equity.

  

13\. Non-Exclusivity; Competitive or Similar Products or Materials.

a. Non-Exclusivity. The arrangements under this Agreement are non-exclusive, and nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor should it be construed, to create any form of exclusive relationship between you and Podium. Unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing, each party is free to enter into similar arrangements with other parties, provided that doing so will not cause the party to violate any of its obligations under this Agreement.

b. Competitive or Similar Products or Materials. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed or construed to preclude or otherwise limit Podium’s ability to discuss, develop, or distribute, either on its own or by a third-party subcontractor, any products, services, or other materials that are similar or competitive to your products, services, or materials, including your Application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may not use your Confidential Information in discussing, developing, or distributing any such products, services, or other materials.

  

14\. **General**.

a. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. You may not assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of Podium, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 14(a) will be null and void.

b. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement only permits use by you and the legal entity or entities you represent and are binding to this Agreement and not any affiliates. Furthermore, your affiliates are not permitted to use the Podium API under this Agreement unless that affiliate agrees to this Agreement individually and receives its own access to the Podium API.

c. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. You must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include "Attn. Legal Department" in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the email address(es) on record for your account or as otherwise provided by you to Podium. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Podium API or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website. You hereby consent to receipt of electronic notices and agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications.

d. Modifications. Podium may update or modify these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights and obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms, or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you will no longer have the right to use the API. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waiver must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

e. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, void or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

f. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement.

g. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

h. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except applicable payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

i. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

j. Injunctive Relief. You understand and agree that the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Podium or Client Data you access or use via the Podium API or Podium Platform may cause irreparable harm to Podium or our Clients. You therefore agree that Podium will have the right to obtain an immediate injunction against any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, as well as the right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a breach.

k. Non-Waiver. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

l. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including any terms, policies, or documents referenced or linked to herein, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium API or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted. Any terms you provide to Podium are for administrative purposes only, and have no legal effect.

The Client Agreement for each Client must include provisions that are at least as protective as those contained in this Agreement. The Client Agreement must also include provisions informing the Client that:

(A) Podium will not be responsible for any support or assistance relating to your Application or services (unless Podium has expressly stated otherwise in writing);

(B) You, not Podium, are solely responsible for your Application, your related services, and for any liability or damages that arise out of a Client’s authorized use of the Application; and

(C) The provisions of your Client Agreement govern the scope of your access and use rights with respect to the Client’s Data and Account.

(ii) Privacy Policy. You must maintain, and your Application must display, a legally compliant privacy policy detailing the data and information you’ll collect from any Client or user when they use your Application, and you agree that you will only use such data and information as expressly authorized by the Client in each case.

(iii) Protected Health Information. To the extent you or your Application or services will access or use any Client Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as that term is defined under HIPAA, you represent and warrant that you will execute a legally valid Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”) with each applicable Client prior to using or accessing their PHI via the Podium API and your Application. You will only use such data as authorized under the BAA and HIPAA and will remain fully liable for any violations with respect to PHI.

b. Security. You will implement and maintain a security program designed to prevent the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of any of the data you access or use via the Podium API and in developing, implementing, and distributing your Application and related services. Your security program must include appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that meet or exceed industry standards, according to the nature and scope of the data you use or access via the Podium API, and which is. You will also ensure that any subcontractor you use in relation to the Podium API also agrees to comply with this provision. You also represent and warrant that any Applications you develop or distribute using the Podium API or Podium Marketplace will not contain any security vulnerabilities. If you are using the Podium API for security testing purposes, you also agree that you will adhere to Podium’s testing policy outlined in our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.podium.com/vulnerability-policy/).

(i) Data Breach and Notification. In the event of any actual or suspected unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss, or processing of Podium Data or Client Data (“Data Breach”) you will notify Podium in writing immediately (but no later than twenty-four (24) hours) upon discovering the Data Breach. Upon becoming aware of any Data Breach, you will, at your own expense, work to immediately mitigate the effects of the Data Breach, correct any flaws or deficiencies that contributed to the Data Breach, and cooperate fully with Podium, including providing any and all information Podium requests relating to the Data Breach. You will also, at your own expense, provide all notifications to Clients, end users, and any other parties affected by the Data Breach as required by law and your contractual obligations to the affected parties.

(ii) Deletion. Except as necessary to comply with your obligations under applicable law, you must immediately delete all Client Data: (a) upon request from the Client; and (b) upon termination of this Agreement or revocation of your access to the Podium API.

  

8\. Confidentiality

a. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 14(f), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 8 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

b. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

c. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

11\. Limitations of Liability.

Termination will not limit any of Podium's rights or remedies at law or in equity.

  

13\. Non-Exclusivity; Competitive or Similar Products or Materials.

a. Non-Exclusivity. The arrangements under this Agreement are non-exclusive, and nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor should it be construed, to create any form of exclusive relationship between you and Podium. Unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing, each party is free to enter into similar arrangements with other parties, provided that doing so will not cause the party to violate any of its obligations under this Agreement.

b. Competitive or Similar Products or Materials. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed or construed to preclude or otherwise limit Podium’s ability to discuss, develop, or distribute, either on its own or by a third-party subcontractor, any products, services, or other materials that are similar or competitive to your products, services, or materials, including your Application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Podium may not use your Confidential Information in discussing, developing, or distributing any such products, services, or other materials.

  

14\. **General**.

a. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. You may not assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of Podium, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Podium may assign this Agreement without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 14(a) will be null and void.

b. No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement only permits use by you and the legal entity or entities you represent and are binding to this Agreement and not any affiliates. Furthermore, your affiliates are not permitted to use the Podium API under this Agreement unless that affiliate agrees to this Agreement individually and receives its own access to the Podium API.

c. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. You must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include "Attn. Legal Department" in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the email address(es) on record for your account or as otherwise provided by you to Podium. Podium may also provide operational notices regarding the Podium API or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of such notice on Podium’s Website. You hereby consent to receipt of electronic notices and agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. Podium is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications.

d. Modifications. Podium may update or modify these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights and obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms, or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification, and continued use of the Services or Website, following the update, will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you will no longer have the right to use the API. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waiver must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

e. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, void or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect, and all other provisions remain in full effect.

f. Subcontractors. Podium may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Podium fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement.

g. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

h. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except applicable payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

i. Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

j. Injunctive Relief. You understand and agree that the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Podium or Client Data you access or use via the Podium API or Podium Platform may cause irreparable harm to Podium or our Clients. You therefore agree that Podium will have the right to obtain an immediate injunction against any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, as well as the right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a breach.

k. Non-Waiver. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

l. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including any terms, policies, or documents referenced or linked to herein, represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the Podium API or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply to this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted.

Partner also agrees to defend Podium against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing, and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense.

During the Term of this Agreement, Partner, at its sole cost and expense, will carry and maintain insurance with a reputable company or companies insuring Partner, its agents, employees, and associates from general liability, specifically covering personal and bodily injury and property damage.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION WILL SURVIVE AND CONTINUE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT DESPITE ANY FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION OR OF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PODIUM PARTNER PROGRAM CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLY BECAUSE OF PODIUM’S RELIANCE UPON THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND THAT ALL SUCH LIMITATIONS FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. SOME STATES LIMIT THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS. IN THOSE STATES, THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.

**15\. GENERAL**
================

15.1. Independent Contractors. Although the term “partner” is used throughout the Agreement, the relationship of the parties established by this Agreement is that of independent contractors, and nothing contained in this Agreement should be construed to give either party the power to: (a) act as an agent; or (b) direct or control the day-to-day activities of the other. Financial and other obligations associated with each party’s business are the sole responsibility of that party.

15.2. Non-Exclusivity. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to create, nor will it be construed as creating, any exclusive arrangement between the parties to this Agreement. This Agreement will not restrict either party from entering into similar arrangements with others, provided it does not breach its obligations under this Agreement by doing so, including without limitation, any confidentiality obligations. Additionally, Podium is not precluded from discussing, reviewing, developing for itself, having developed, acquiring, licensing, or developing for or by third parties, as well as marketing and distributing materials, products or services which are competitive with Partner’s products or services, regardless of their similarity to Partner’s products or services, provided that Podium does violate its confidentiality obligations to do so.

15.3. Direct Sales by Podium. Podium reserves the unrestricted right to market, distribute, sell, and upsell the Podium Products and Podium Services worldwide, including without limitation through original equipment manufacturers, value added resellers, and other third-party intermediaries, and directly to End Users.

15.4. Assignability. Partner may not assign its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement without Podium’s prior written consent, except in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale or exclusive license of all or substantially all of Partner’s assets to a party that could not reasonably be deemed a competitor of Podium. If consent is given, this Agreement will bind Partner’s successors and assigns. Any attempt by Partner to transfer its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement is void.

15.5. Non-Solicitation; Noncompetition. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six months thereafter, neither party hereto will solicit any End User of the other party to cease doing business with such other party; provided, however, that this provision will not limit the ability of a party to continue servicing such End User(s) with respect to services performed by such party during the Term of this Agreement. Additionally, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, Partner will not, directly or indirectly, (a) employ or solicit the employment or services of an employee of Podium; or (b) develop or offer for sale, or license, to any End User or other third party any tools or services that directly compete with or are substantially similar to any Podium Services without the prior express written consent of Podium.

15.6. Notices. Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Partner must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to Podium Headquarters and include "Attn. Legal Department" in the subject line or, if by email, to legal@podium.com. Podium may send notices to the email addresses listed on Partner’s PPA or Partner Portal account, or, at Podium’s option, to Partner’s last-known postal address.

15.7. Amendments; Waivers. Podium may update or modify these Terms (including referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website, Podium Service, or Partner Portal, or by notification via the email associated with your Podium Partner account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue your activity as a partner. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Renewal Term. Your continued activity as a Partner, following notice of any material update, will also constitute acceptance of the updated Terms. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you will no longer have the right to continue as a Podium Partner. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

15.8. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except Partner’s payment obligations to Podium) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order. Each party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of any force majeure event.

15.9. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the state courts located in Salt Lake County or Utah County, Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

15.10. Severability; Binding Effect. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity and enforceability of any such provision in any other respect and of the remaining provisions of the terms will not be impaired. The Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties and their heirs, personal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.

15.11. Interpretation. The parties have had an equal opportunity to review this Agreement and the attached exhibits, if any. No ambiguity will be construed against any party based upon a claim that that party drafted the ambiguous language. The headings appearing at the beginning of several sections contained in this Agreement have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and must not be used to construe or interpret this Agreement. Whenever required by context, a singular number will include the plural, the plural number will include the singular, and the gender of any pronoun will include all genders.

15.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of identical counterparts, notwithstanding that the parties have not signed the same counterpart, with the same effect as if the parties had signed the same document. All counterparts will be construed as and constitute the same agreement. This Agreement may also be executed and delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission and such execution and delivery will have the same force and effect of an original document with original signatures.

15.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all exhibits and the applicable PPA, is the final and complete expression of the agreement between these parties regarding the Agreement’s subject matter. This Agreement supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into this Agreement. No employee, agent, or other representative of Podium has any authority to bind Podium with respect to any statement, representation, warranty, or other expression unless the same is specifically set forth in this Agreement. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter the terms of this Agreement. Any terms provided by Partner (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Partner) are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

Podium will provide Partner electronic or written confirmation of its acceptance (or denial) of a Referral Lead. Each Referral Lead submitted to Podium which Podium has accepted in writing will be referred to as a “Qualified Referral Lead.” The date on which such acceptance is given will be referred to, with respect to such Qualified Referral Lead, as the “Qualified Referral Lead Date.” To the extent Podium shares affiliate links with Partner for use with Referral Leads, Partner will not share such affiliate links publicly in any manner.

(d) Partner fails to submit the Referral Lead in accordance with the procedures designated by Podium in this Agreement or Partner fails to comply with any other procedure or policy set forth in the Partner Portal: or

(e) Such Referral Lead is identified as a competitor to Podium.

**3\. REFERRAL PAYMENT**
========================

3.1. Referral Payment Calculation. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Podium will pay Partner a one-time commission for each Qualified Referral Lead that completes an End User Transaction directly with Podium during the Term (the “Referral Payment”). The Referral Payment will be calculated as a percentage (using the percentage set forth in Partner’s PPA or the applicable Partner Portal commission report) of the annual subscription fees for each applicable End User Transaction. For clarity, no Referral Payment(s) will be made on any non-subscription based Podium Services, including Podium Payments.

3.2. Referral Payment Schedule. Referral Payments will be calculated within the first week of the month following the applicable End User Transaction. The Referral Payment will be issued within forty-five (45) days after the end of the month in which the Referral Payment accrued.

(a) Not be in breach of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

(b) Provide to Podium all necessary information for payment, including but not limited to Partner’s banking account information and/or mailing address;

(c) Prior to commencing Partner activities, submit to Podium the necessary tax documents (i.e., a fully completed Form W-9 including Partner’s Tax Identification Number for U.S.-based partners, or Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E for non-U.S.- based partners); and

(d) Notify Podium in writing of any changes to Partner’s address, banking information, or other information necessary to complete a Referral Payment.

3.4. Delays; Forfeiture. Failure to submit Form W-9 (or Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E tax forms, where applicable) before the first payout of the Referral Payment or to keep payment information up to date may result in delay of payment. Additionally, notwithstanding the forgoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if: (a) any of the requirements set forth in Section 3.3 above remain outstanding for six (6) months immediately following the End User Transaction for Partner’s Qualified Referral Lead, or (b) Podium has attempted to pay Partner a Referral Payment by bank transfer or by check at least twice and both attempts have been unsuccessful, then Partner’s right to receive a Referral Payment for that Qualified Referral Lead will be forever forfeited (“Forfeited Payment”). Podium assumes no obligation or responsibility to pay Partner a Referral Payment once it has been designated a Forfeited Payment.

If consent is given, this Agreement will bind Partner’s successors and assigns. Any attempt by Partner to transfer its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement is void.

During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six months thereafter, neither party hereto will solicit any End User of the other party to cease doing business with such other party; provided, however, that this provision shall not limit the ability of a party to continue servicing such End User(s) with respect to services performed by such party during the Term of this Agreement. Additionally, during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, Partner will not, directly or indirectly, (a) employ or solicit the employment or services of an employee or independent contractor of Podium; or (b) develop or offer for sale or license to any End User or other third-party tools or services that directly competes with or is substantially similar to any Podium Product(s) without the prior express written consent of Podium.

If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you will no longer have access to the Services and/or Partner Portal. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

15.8 Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order. Each party will use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of any force majeure event.

Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

15.8 Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED EXPRESSLY HEREIN, THE PODIUM MARKETPLACE, ANY APPS, AND ALL RELATED SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

**PODIUM BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT**

  

This **Podium Business Associate Agreement** (“**BAA**”) is incorporated into the applicable [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) or Master Services Agreement (the “**Underlying Agreement**”) for any Podium Corporation, Inc. (“Podium”) client in which the applicable Podium Services (as defined in the Underlying Agreement) may involve the creation, maintenance, use, transmission or disclosure of protected health information (“**PHI**”) within the meaning of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“**HITECH**”), and their implementing regulations, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 as they shall be amended (collectively the “**HIPAA Rules**”). In such case, Podium will be considered the “**Business Associate**” hereunder and the Podium client will be considered the “**Covered Entity**” hereunder.

If and only to the extent that Business Associate is a “business associate” as defined in the HIPAA Rules, this BAA supplements the Underlying Agreement and is intended to and will be interpreted to satisfy the requirements for business associate agreements as set forth in the HIPAA Rules. If Business Associate is not a business associate as defined in the HIPAA Rules, this BAA will be void notwithstanding any other terms to the contrary.

1. **DEFINITIONS**. The following terms used in this BAA will have the same meaning as those terms in the HIPAA Rules: Business Associate, Breach, Covered Entity, Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Electronic Protected Health Information, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices, Privacy Officer, Privacy Rule, Protected Health Information, Required By Law, Secretary, Security Rule, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.

2.3. Report to Covered Entity any use or disclosure of PHI not provided for by the BAA of which it becomes aware, including breaches of unsecured PHI as required at 45 CFR 164.410, and any security incident as required by 45 CFR § 164.314(a)(2). The parties acknowledge that Business Associate is periodically subject to attempted but unsuccessful attempts to access its information system (e.g., typical “pings” or port scans), but that such unsuccessful attempts are trivial, routine, and do not constitute a material threat to the security of protected health information. The parties agree that further notice of such trivial but unsuccessful attempts will not be required unless expressly required by Covered Entity;

2.4. In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)-(2) and 164.308(b)(2)-(3), if applicable, to ensure that any subcontractor(s) that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of Business Associate agrees to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to Business Associate with respect to such information. Business Associate may fulfill this requirement by having the subcontractors execute an agreement that incorporates the terms of this BAA;

2.5. Within fifteen (15) days after Covered Entity’s request, make available PHI in a designated record set to the Covered Entity as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity’s obligations under 45 CFR 164.524;

2.6. Within thirty (30) days after Covered Entity’s request, make available to Covered Entity any protected health information for amendment and incorporate any amendments to protected health information as necessary to enable Covered Entity to satisfy its obligations under 45 CFR 164.526;

2.7. Within thirty (30) days after Covered Entity’s request, make available to Covered Entity the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures as necessary to enable Covered Entity to satisfy Covered Entity’s obligations under 45 CFR 164.528;

2.8. To the extent Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity’s obligation(s) under 45 CFR Part 164, Subpart E (“**HIPAA Privacy Rule**”), comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and

2.9. Make Business Associate’s internal practices, books, and records relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information received from, or created or received by Business Associate on behalf of Covered Entity, available to the Secretary for purposes of determining Covered Entity’s compliance with the HIPAA Rules.

3. **USES AND DISCLOSURES BY BUSINESS ASSOCIATE.**

3.1. **Permitted Uses and Disclosures of PHI.** Business Associate may use or disclose protected health information only as follows:

3.1.1. As necessary to perform the services set forth in the Underlying Agreement, or as otherwise expressly authorized or permitted by the Underlying Agreement.

By clicking on “I agree” (or a similar button) or by using or developing on the Podium Developer Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms, so please read them carefully.

These Podium Developer Terms (the “**Developer Terms”** or "**Terms**") are a binding agreement between Podium and the individual or entity registering as a developer on the Podium Developer Platform ("**you**" or "**Developer**"). If you are using the Podium Developer Platform on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then “**Developer**” or “**you**” means that entity, and you are binding that entity to these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have the legal power and authority to enter into these Terms and that, if the Developer is an entity, these Terms are entered into by an employee, agent, or other authorized representative with all necessary authority to bind that entity to these Terms. The Podium Developer Platform is not intended for and may not be used by anyone under the age of 18.

Podium may modify these Terms from time to time, subject to Section 19.7 (Amendments; Waiver).

1\. Program Overview. The Podium marketplace is an online marketplace (the “**Marketplace**”) for cloud and downloadable software applications, plugins, and extensions that are designed to operate in connection with Podium’s Services (“**Apps**”). Pursuant to these Terms, you may develop Apps to be listed on the Marketplace where Podium clients subscribed to Podium’s Services (“**Podium Clients**”) may access and use your Apps. The Podium Marketplace is intended only to be used and accessed in the United States, Canada, and Australia (the “**Territory**”). “**Podium Developer Platform**” means Podium’s developer platform, including the Podium API (as defined in the [Podium API Terms of Use](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#api-tou-us) (the “**API Terms**”)), API keys, CLIs, sample code, access tokens, SDKs, and other tools described at [https://docs.podium.com/docs](https://docs.podium.com/docs). Your use of the Podium Developer Platform, the ecosystem of Apps, and the Marketplace, and your interaction with Podium Clients is governed by these Terms (the “**Podium Developer Program**”).

2\. Eligibility.

2.1. In order to develop to the Marketplace, you must be in good standing and not previously suspended or removed from the Podium Developer Program in the past.

2.2. The following use cases for developing Apps are permitted under these Terms. Any other use cases must be expressly approved in writing by Podium in advance:

2.2.1. A Podium Client developing an App solely for its own personal and private use (a “**Private App**”);

2.2.2. A third-party developer developing an App for a single Podium Client that intends to submit Apps to the Marketplace for use solely by such Podium Client (a “**Third-Party Private App**”); or

2.2.3. A third-party developer developing an App for use by any Podium Client via the Marketplace (a “**Public App**”).

2.3. Prior to developing and/or hosting an App on the Marketplace, Podium must validate that you are an established company or individual developer. If Developer is an individual, you must be 18 years or older.

3\. Use Rights. You may use the Podium Developer Platform to develop and use Apps in connection with Podium Services, but only as permitted by these Terms and the [API Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#api-tou-us). Failure to comply with the requirements listed in these Terms may result in Podium, in its sole discretion, removing your App from the Marketplace and suspending your access to the Marketplace, the Sandbox, the Podium API, and the Podium Developer Platform. All of your use rights in these Terms (including your rights to use Podium Marks below) are limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable. You may, however, permit your agents and contractors to exercise your use rights on your behalf, provided that you remain responsible for their compliance with these Terms. You agree to comply as follows:

3.1. Compliance with Podium Policies. Subject to all terms and conditions of these Terms, including any Additional Terms, Podium grants Developer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right and license within the Territory (to the extent available in the Territory) to use the Podium Developer Platform to develop Apps, but only in accordance with these Terms (including the [API Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#api-tou-us)), Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and all applicable scope of use descriptions provided to Developer by Podium. Although the Podium Services, the Podium Developer Platform, and the Marketplace may be accessible worldwide, Podium makes no representation that the Podium Services, the Podium Developer Platform, Apps, or the Marketplace are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the Territory (or that all products or features of the Podium Services, Podium Developer Platform, Apps, or the Marketplace are available throughout the Territory). Furthermore, accessing the Podium Services, Podium Developer Platform, Apps, or the Marketplace from territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Podium Services, Podium Developer Platform, Apps, or the Marketplace from other locations do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws and any costs associated with access or use outside the Territory. You may not use or export the Podium Services, Podium Developer Platform, Apps, or the Marketplace in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations.

3.2. Compliance with Laws. You warrant and represent that you will fully comply with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws, rules, and regulations, or amendments thereto, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission’s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“**HIPAA**”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the CAN-SPAM Act, Do Not Call rules and prohibitions, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”) (individually a “**Law**” and collectively, “**Laws**”) and that you will not develop Apps in a manner that would violate or cause Podium or any Podium Clients to violate any obligation with respect to any Laws. You also warrant and represent that: (a) You have a license to use any Podium End-User Data provided that is used in connection with an App or the Marketplace and any Podium End-User Data and Podium’s use thereof will not violate third-party rights, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity rights and (b) You have authorization to provide Podium with any Podium Client information you provide in connection with the Podium Services, your App, or the Marketplace, including but not limited to any End-User Data and any personally identifying information. If you receive any take-down requests or infringement notices related to Podium End-User Data, your App, or your use of third-party products or data, you will promptly stop using these items with the Podium Services, your App, and the Marketplace and notify Podium immediately.

3.3. HIPAA Compliance. If you are a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, and are operating as a subcontractor to Podium, you agree to the terms of Podium’s Subcontractor BAA (currently available at [https://www.podium.com/#subcontractor-business-associate-agreement/](https://www.podium.com/subcontractor-business-associate-agreement/)) (the “**Subcontractor BAA**”), which may be amended from time to time, and to secure and utilize Protected Health Information (as that term is defined in HIPAA) in accordance with the Subcontractor BAA.

4\. Permissions, and Limitations. Podium may place limits on access to the Podium Developer Platform and Marketplace and on use of the Podium API (e.g., limits on numbers of calls or requests). Podium may also monitor your usage of the Podium Developer Platform and Marketplace and limit the number of calls or requests you may make if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that your usage violates these Terms or may negatively affect the Podium Developer Platform, the Marketplace, or any Podium Clients (or otherwise impose liability on Podium). You agree to take all reasonable efforts to limit the use of the Podium API and to use only the minimum necessary calls, requests, pushes, integrations, Podium API, endpoints, or webhooks to make your App function. Each App should request the fewest number of authorization or permission scopes required to function.

5\. Marketing Activities. You will bear all costs and expenses related to your marketing or promotion of Podium, any Podium Services, the Marketplace, and, as applicable, your Apps or your other products or services associated with your participation in the Podium Developer Program (collectively, “**Partner Marketing Activities**”). Partner Marketing Activities are limited to the Territory. Podium may promote your App as it sees fit in its sole discretion.

5.1. App Listing. Apps will be listed in the Marketplace once approved by Podium. App listing content will be provided by you and approved by Podium. Public Apps will be listed for all users of the Marketplace to view, access, and use. If your App is a Private App or a Third-Party Private App, it will not be listed publicly in the Marketplace, but will be accessible by you or the Podium Client who hired you to develop the App.

5.2. No commission, fees, revenue sharing, or profit sharing will be exchanged unless noted expressly in additional terms between you and Podium.

6\. Onboarding/Offboarding. The documented authentication path specified at [https://docs.podium.com/docs/oauth](https://docs.podium.com/docs/oauth) is currently the only supported method for customer onboarding. Your App will require no manual onboarding (meaning it requires a person to integrate, set up, or install the App) by Podium. If your App requires manual onboarding, you must provide such services directly to the Podium Client(s). Podium will not manually generate tokens, access, or integrations. If your App requires manual onboarding, upon receipt of an order notification, you will be required to onboard and assist the Podium Client so that they can fully use your App within 5 days. Additionally, if your App requires manual onboarding, specific details must be added to the Marketplace listing for your App to clearly notify Podium Clients of this requirement. Fulfillment and onboarding costs will solely be your responsibility.

7\. Required Documentation. The following documentation is required between you and any Podium Client who uses your App and must be provided for review by Podium as part of each App approval and listing process:

7.1. End User Terms (“**End User Terms**”) between you and any Podium Client who uses your App. You must obtain all necessary permissions, authorizations, and consents from each Client or end user, as the case may be, to access and use their Client account and Client Data via the Podium API, your App, and Services. You must ensure anyone who uses your App agrees to your End User Terms, which must comply with all Laws. The End User Terms for each Client must include provisions that are at least as protective as those contained in these Terms. The End User Terms must also include provisions informing the Client that:

7.1.1. Podium will not be responsible for any support or assistance relating to your App or services (unless Podium has expressly stated otherwise in writing);

7.1.2. You, not Podium, are solely responsible for your App, your related services, and for any liability or damages that arise out of a Client’s authorized use of the App; and

7.1.3. The provisions of your End User Terms govern the scope of your access and use rights with respect to the Client’s Data and account.

7.2. Privacy Policy between you and any Podium Client who uses your App (“**End User Privacy Policy**”). The Privacy Policy must be a legally compliant privacy policy detailing the data and information you’ll collect from any Client or user when they use your App, and you agree that you will only use such data and information as expressly authorized by the Client in each case

7.3. Business Associate Agreement (“**End User BAA**”) between you and any Podium Client who uses your App if your App is subject to HIPAA. You will only use Client Protected Health Information (“**PHI**”) as that term is defined under HIPAA, as authorized under the BAA and HIPAA and will remain fully liable for any violations with respect to PHI.

7.4. List of software licenses currently in use.

8\. Developer Approval Process for Sandbox Access. In order to access the developer test platform (the “**Sandbox**”), you must: (a) agree to the [API Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#api-tou-us); (b) have a valid Developer Account; (c) request Sandbox access from Podium; and (d) not use Sandbox for any purpose other than the development of an App intended to operate in conjunction with the Podium API and which will be listed on the Marketplace. Developer Accounts and Sandbox use may be monitored and throttled at Podium’s discretion. Sandbox functionality and features may vary over time. Sandbox access can be revoked at any time at Podium's sole discretion.

9\. App Approval Process. Your App will generally be reviewed by Podium within 2 weeks of submission of the documentation and information described in Section 9 and Section 10 (“**App Approval Requirements**”). If your App is rejected, you will be notified with reasons and requirements to resubmit, if applicable. Once approved you will receive a notification of your App’s approval. Podium reserves the right to reject any App for any reason. Your App may only permit session cookies to have the following attributes set: Secure, HTTPOnly. Prior to Podium approving your App, you must submit the following information:

9.1. Submit your App with listing content including:

9.1.1. App name;

9.1.2. App description;

9.1.3. App Logo;

9.1.4. API scope access needed;

9.1.5. API scope access reasoning;

9.1.6. the documentation listed in Section 9; and

9.1.7. emergency engineering contact email

9.2. You must provide additional App solution documentation outlining App functionality, Podium API used, screen shots, user flow, feature set, install instructions, setup time, pricing (if applicable), industries served, and general customer expectations.

9.3. App testing instructions must be provided to Podium for review purposes, including but not limited to, steps, credentials, and any other pertinent information to reproduce the end-user experience.

9.4. You must certify that your App does not sell data, collect personally identifiable data without valid authorization or consent, send data outside the Territory, perform functions not outlined in the App description, or mislead Podium Clients in any way.

9.5. You must verify and certify to Podium that your App complies with the requirements of Section 10.

10\. Security Certification. Your App must comply with the requirements listed in the Developer Security and SLA Requirements document located at ([https://partner-terms.podium.com/#DSSR](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#DSSR)) (the “**Security SLA Documentation**”) \[Currently available at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RomvY79rnqi3Mg8HOcW7xJh6miKvNfJJYCxov41MZrM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RomvY79rnqi3Mg8HOcW7xJh6miKvNfJJYCxov41MZrM/edit?usp=sharing)\]. Podium may revoke your access to the Marketplace and remove or disable your App if you violate any of the security or service level requirements contained in the Security/SLA Documentation. If your App breaches any of the security or service level requirements contained in the Security/SLA Documentation, you may apply for recertification by following the steps outlined in these Terms for an App approval and by documenting how your resubmission cures the violations.

11\. Data Use and Ownership.

11.1. Podium End-User Data. For purposes of these Terms, “**End-User Data**” means any data, content, or information of an end user or Podium Client that is accessed, collected, or otherwise processed by you or your App in connection with use of the Podium Developer Platform, Podium API, or Podium Services. Podium Clients may enable you or your Apps to access End-User Data. Based on the activities under these Terms, Podium may provide you with access to End-User Data.

11.2. Collection and Use. You must obtain all necessary rights, permissions, and consents from Podium Clients and any end users for your access, collection, storage, transmission, treatment, use, disclosure, sharing, and other processing of any End-User Data, and you must ensure that all such processing complies with your End User Terms, your End User Privacy Policy, your End User BAA (if applicable), and all Laws. If you use the Podium API to retrieve End-User Data directly from Podium, you must limit your access and processing of such information to that (a) authorized by the Podium Client or (b) necessary for the purposes of providing the functionality of your App. You may not sell any End-User Data. Podium will not be liable for, or have any responsibility in connection with, End-User Data processed by you or your App, and such activities with regard to End-User Data are not in any way by or on behalf of Podium.

11.3. Ownership of Apps and Marketplace. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, including under these terms, Podium claims no ownership of your Apps. You may reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms, including any goodwill associated with Your Marks. Podium retains all ownership and other rights (including all intellectual property rights) in the Podium Developer Platform, the Services, the Podium Marks (including associated goodwill), and the Marketplace. Providing feedback, comments or suggestions about the Podium Developer Platform, the Services, or the Marketplace ("**Feedback**") to Podium is completely voluntary, and Podium may freely use Feedback for any purpose.

11.4. End User Communications. You may use End-User Data to communicate directly with Podium Clients or any third parties only where the communication is with technical or billing contacts, required by Laws, or as consented to or requested by the end user. You also agree that you will not send advertisements, marketing, telemarketing, or promotional messages, as such are defined in applicable Laws (hereinafter, collectively “**Marketing Messages**”), and that you may not use the Services, the Podium APIs, or the Marketplace to send Marketing Messages to Podium Clients unless you have valid consent from such Podium Client.

12\. Confidential Information. “**Confidential Information**” means code, inventions, know-how, product plans, technical and financial, business, operational, or other information exchanged under these Terms or learned during the performance of these Terms, or that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should reasonably be considered confidential based on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information disclosed.

12.1. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under these Terms. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 19.5), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 12 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 12.

12.2. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

12.3. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section 12 each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

13\. Intellectual Property

13.1. Use of Marks. Subject to these Terms, you may use the Podium’s name, logos, or trademarks (collectively the “**Podium Marks**”) to promote your Application(s) as compatible with the relevant Podium Products. Your use of Podium Marks must be approved by Podium, and (without limiting Podium's other termination rights) you must promptly cease any use of Podium Marks identified by Podium as problematic. You may not register any domain name containing Podium Marks, the word "Podium" or the name of any Podium Product (or anything confusingly similar) and if you have done so you agree to transfer ownership of the domain name to Podium at no charge. You also agree not to contest the validity of ownership of any Podium Marks. You receive no other rights to Podium Marks under these Terms. All goodwill arising from use of Podium Marks inures to Podium.

13.2. Your Marks. If you make your Apps available to Podium Clients (or other end users), Podium may (but is not obligated to) use Your Marks to identify you as a Podium developer and to promote your Apps and Podium’s Services and the Marketplace.

14\. Term; Termination. These Terms will remain in effect until terminated, as set forth below (the “**Term**”).

14.1. Termination by You. You may terminate these Terms at any time by ceasing all use of the Podium Developer Platform, the Podium API, the Marketplace, and any relevant developer credentials, and by notifying Podium of your intent to terminate this Agreement and use of the Podium Developer Platform.

14.2. Termination by Podium. Podium may terminate these Terms at any time in Podium’s sole discretion.

14.3. Effect of Termination. Upon any suspension or termination, you must cease using the Podium Developer Platform, the Podium API, the Marketplace, and any Podium Marks and, at Podium’s request, return or destroy all Confidential Information. Section 3 (Use Rights), Section 10 (Security Certification), Section 11 (Data Use and Ownership), Section 13.2 (Your Marks), Section 12 (Confidential Information) and Section 19 (General) will survive any termination of these Terms. After termination, you will have no further access to any Podium developer website or portal or to any data or content that you submitted to Podium relating to the Podium Developer Platform or Marketplace. Podium may delete any of your data at its sole discretion. Podium will have no obligation or liability resulting from termination or suspension of these Terms as permitted above.

15\. Indemnification.

15.1. Indemnification by User. You will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries, and agents (together, the “**Podium Entities**”) from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Marketplace and/or any App; (b) your violation of, or any claim that you have violated, any applicable Law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right; (c) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including but not limited to your end user(s), customers, any Developer, and any Third-Party Service Providers); (d) misuse of any customer data; (e) Podium’s use, as contemplated in these Terms, of any information provided to Podium by you or your end users or customers; (f) breach or alleged breach of these Terms; or (g) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that you have violated any Law. You also agree to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, you agree to cooperate with our defense of any such claims. You may not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts, or take or refrain from taking any action. Developer will promptly inform Podium of any information known to Developer that could reasonably lead to a claim, demand, or liability of or against Podium by any third party.

16\. Limited Warranty of the Marketplace and Disclaimers.

THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 16.1 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN. DEVELOPER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

16.2. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE PODIUM DEVELOPER PLATFORM, PODIUM API, THE MARKETPLACE, THE SERVICES, OR PODIUM ENTITIES, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THEREIN, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE PODIUM DEVELOPER PLATFORM, PODIUM API, OR MARKETPLACE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

19\. GENERAL

19.1. Assignment. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign these Terms without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Podium may assign these Terms without consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign these Terms except as expressly authorized under this Section 19.1 will be null and void.

19.2. Independent Contractors. The parties to these Terms are independent contractors, and these Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

19.3. Non-Exclusivity. Nothing in these Terms is intended to create, nor will it be construed as creating, any exclusive arrangement between the parties to these Terms. These Terms will not restrict either Party from entering into similar arrangements with others, provided it does not breach its obligations under these Terms by doing so, including without limitation, any confidentiality obligations. Additionally, Podium is not precluded from discussing, reviewing, developing for itself, having developed, acquiring, licensing, or developing for or by third parties, as well as marketing and distributing materials, products or services which are competitive with Developer’s products or services, regardless of their similarity to Developer’s products or services, provided that Podium does violate its confidentiality obligations to do so.

**DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN**

**PODIUM AND SUBCONTRACTOR**

  

This Downstream Business Associate Agreement (“**Downstream BAA**”) will be incorporated in the applicable Podium [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) (the “**Developer Terms**”) for Developers in the Podium Developer Program (each a “**Subcontractor**”) that are business associates (as defined in HIPAA) or who process, store, or transfer Protected Health Information (“**PHI**”) (as defined in HIPAA) for use with certain products and services owned by Podium Corporation, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (“**Podium**”).

Background

Pursuant to the parties’ agreement in the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers), Subcontractor has agreed to perform certain services for or on behalf of Podium that may involve the creation, maintenance, use, transmission, or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of one or more of Podium’s Clients (each, a “**Covered Entity**” and collectively, “**Covered Entities**”) within the meaning of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“**HIPAA**”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“**HITECH**”), and their implementing regulations, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 (collectively the “**HIPAA Rules**”). Subcontractor is a subcontractor of Podium and is a Podium when Subcontractor requests, creates, receives, maintains, transmits, uses, or discloses (individually or collectively, “**Processes**”) PHI on behalf of Podium or one of Podium’s Clients (as defined in the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers)). This **Downstream BAA** supplements the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) and is intended to and will be interpreted to satisfy the requirements for business associate agreements as set forth in the HIPAA Rules as they will be amended. Subcontractor understands and acknowledges that, as a business associate, Subcontractor is subject to certain HIPAA Rules, and that the violation of the HIPAA Rules carries significant administrative and criminal penalties as described in 45 CFR § 160.404 and 42 USC § 1320d-6.

In consideration of the mutual premises and covenants contained herein and in the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Subcontractor and Podium agree as follows:

**1\. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**1.1.** **Defined Terms**. Capitalized terms used in this **Downstream BAA** without definition have the respective meanings assigned to such terms by the Administrative Simplification section of HITECH and HIPAA.

**1.2. Applicability**. Subcontractor acknowledges that (a) Podium is a Business Associate of its Covered Entities, and (b) Subcontractor is a downstream Business Associate of Podium under the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers). This **Downstream BAA** relates to PHI that Subcontractor accesses or receives from Podium, a Covered Entity, or a third party on behalf of Podium in connection with this **Downstream BAA**.

**1.3. HIPAA Amendments**. The parties acknowledge and agree that HITECH and its implementing regulations impose requirements with respect to privacy, security, and breach notification applicable to Business Associates (collectively the “**HITECH BA Provisions**”). The HITECH BA Provisions and any other future amendments to HIPAA affecting business associate agreements are hereby incorporated by reference into this **Downstream BAA** as if set forth in this **Downstream BAA** in their entirety, effective on the later of the Effective Date or such subsequent date as may be specified by HIPAA.

**1.4. Regulatory References**. A reference in this **Downstream BAA** to a section in HIPAA means the section as it may be amended from time to time.

**1.5. Relationship of the Parties**. Subcontractor is and at all times during this **Downstream BAA** will be acting as an independent contractor to Podium, and not as Podium’s agent. Podium will not have authority to control the method or manner in which Subcontractor performs its services on behalf of Podium, provided that Subcontractor complies with the terms of this **Downstream BAA** and the HIPAA Rules. Subcontractor will not have authority to bind Podium to any liability unless expressly authorized by Podium in writing, and Podium will not be liable for the acts or omissions of Subcontractor. Subcontractor will not represent itself as the agent of Podium. Nothing in this **Downstream BAA** will be deemed to establish an agency, partnership, joint venture, or other relationship except that of independently contracting entities.

**1.6.** **Rights to PHI.** Subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its employees, agents, consultants, or assigns will have any rights in any of the PHI or to Process the PHI in any form, including stripped or aggregated information or statistical information derived from or in connection with the PHI, except as expressly permitted in the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) and this **Downstream BAA**.

**2\. OBLIGATIONS OF SUBCONTRACTOR**

**2.1. Subcontractor Responsibilities**. Subcontractor must fully comply with all relevant laws relating to the privacy or security of PHI applicable to Subcontractor, including but not limited to the HIPAA Rules as applicable to subcontractors. Subcontractor may not use or disclose PHI except as permitted by this **Downstream BAA** or as otherwise required by law. Subcontractor may only Process PHI as permitted or required under the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) (including this **Downstream BAA**) or as Required by Law but must not otherwise use, disclose, or Process PHI. Subcontractor must use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of PHI other than as permitted by this **Downstream BAA** or each Covered Entity **Downstream BAA**. To the extent applicable to business associates, Subcontractor will comply with the requirements in 45 CFR Part 164, Subpart C, including the use of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic protected health information. Subcontractor may not Process PHI in any manner that would constitute a violation of HIPAA if so used or disclosed by Podium or any Covered Entity except as set forth in Sections 2.1(b) and (c) of this **Downstream BAA**. To the extent Subcontractor carries out any of Podium's or a Covered Entity’s obligations under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, Subcontractor must comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to Podium and Covered Entities in the performance of such obligations. To the extent Subcontractor is to carry out a Covered Entity’s obligations under 45 CFR Part 164, Subpart E (“**HIPAA Privacy Rule**”), Subcontractor must comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to a Covered Entity in the performance of such obligations. Except as otherwise stated in this **Downstream BAA**, Subcontractor may not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the HIPAA Rules if done by a Covered Entity. Under no circumstances will Subcontractor sell the PHI in violation of the HIPAA Rules Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Subcontractor is permitted to use or disclose PHI as set forth below:

(a) Subcontractor may use and disclose PHI to carry out Subcontractor's duties and obligations under the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) or under any agreement between Subcontractor and Podium or a Covered Entity;

(b) Subcontractor may use PHI internally for Subcontractor's proper management and administrative services or to carry out its legal responsibilities;

(c) To the extent required by the “minimum necessary” requirements of the HIPAA Rules, Subcontractor may only Process the minimum amount of PHI necessary to accomplish the purpose of the request, use, or disclosure. Subcontractor must comply with the minimum necessary guidance to be issued by the Secretary pursuant to HIPAA and, to the extent practicable, will not Process any Direct Identifiers (as defined in the limited data set standard of HIPAA).

(d) Subcontractor may disclose PHI to a third party for Subcontractor's proper management and administration, provided that the disclosure is required by law or Subcontractor enters into a written agreement with the third party under which the third party agrees to (1) protect the confidentiality, security, and privacy of the PHI, (2) only use or further disclose the PHI as required by law or for the purpose for which the PHI was disclosed to the third party, and (3) notify Subcontractor of any instances of which the third party is aware in which the confidentiality of the PHI has been breached; and

(e) Subcontractor agrees that none of the PHI it receives or its agents or subcontractors receive from Podium will be exported or stored (including temporary storage) outside of the United States.

**2.2. Safeguards**. Subcontractor must use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this **Downstream BAA**. In addition, Subcontractor must implement Administrative Safeguards, Physical Safeguards, and Technical Safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of Electronic Protected Health Information (“**EPHI**”) that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits on behalf of Podium. Without limiting the foregoing, Subcontractor must comply with the HIPAA Security Rule and with all other applicable provisions of HIPAA with respect to EPHI.

**2.3. Mitigation**. Subcontractor must take reasonable steps to mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect (that is known to Subcontractor) of a use or disclosure of PHI by Subcontractor in violation of this **Downstream BAA** or HIPAA.

**2.4. Subcontractors**. Subcontractor may not subcontract any services that require it to disclose PHI that it has received from or created on behalf of Podium or any Covered Entities unless expressly authorized in the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) or this **Downstream BAA**. In the event Subcontractor is authorized to disclose such PHI, prior to any such permitted disclosure Subcontractor must enter into a written agreement meeting the requirements of 45 C.F.R. §§ 164.504(e) and 164.314(a)(2) with each Subcontractor (including, without limitation, a Subcontractor that is an agent under applicable law) that Processes PHI on behalf of Subcontractor. If Subcontractor is authorized to subcontract services, Subcontractor must ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information on behalf of Subcontractor agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements set forth in this **Downstream BAA** and the HIPAA Rules applicable to such subcontractors. Subcontractor may fulfill this requirement by executing a written agreement with the subcontractor incorporating the terms of this **Downstream BAA** and, to the extent necessary, otherwise complying with the requirements in 45 CFR §§ 164.308, 164.502, and 164.504. Subcontractor must ensure that the written agreement with each Subcontractor obligates the Subcontractor to comply with restrictions and conditions that are at least as restrictive as the restrictions and conditions that apply to Subcontractor under this **Downstream BAA**. In no event may Subcontractor, without Podium’s prior written approval, provide PHI to any employee or agent, including any Subcontractor, if such employee, agent, or Subcontractor receives, processes, or otherwise has access to the PHI outside of the United States.

**2.5. Reporting Requirements**. Subcontractor must immediately report to Podium any use or disclosure of PHI not permitted by this **Downstream BAA** or HIPAA of which Subcontractor becomes aware, including but not limited to (a) use or disclosure of PHI in violation of this **Downstream BAA** or HIPAA by Subcontractor or by a third party to which Subcontractor disclosed PHI, (b) breaches of unsecured PHI as required by 45 CFR § 164.410, and (c) security incidents as required by 45 CFR § 164.314. When Subcontractor reports a breach of Protected Health Information (whether secured or unsecured), the report must include the content required by 45 C.F.R. § 164.410 (collectively an “**Unauthorized Use or Disclosure**”). Subcontractor’s duty to report does not permit Subcontractor to notify those individuals whose PHI has been breached by Subcontractor without the express written permission of Podium to do so. All notifications to those individuals whose PHI has been breached must be made under the direction, review, and control of Podium. Subcontractor will not make any public disclosure, including to the media, of the foregoing without the approval of Podium, or in instances where Subcontractor is compelled by law or court order, without notifying Podium of such disclosure. The parties acknowledge that Subcontractor is periodically subject to attempted but unsuccessful attempts to access its information system (e.g., typical “pings” or port scans), but that such unsuccessful attempts are trivial, routine, and do not constitute a material threat to the security of PHI. The parties agree that further notice of such trivial but unsuccessful attempts will not be required unless expressly required by Podium.

**2.6. Cooperation with Podium**. Subcontractor will fully cooperate with Podium’s efforts to promptly investigate, mitigate, and notify third parties of breaches of unsecured protected health information or security incidents as required by the HIPAA Rules. Subcontractor will pay for or reimburse Podium for its expenses, costs, losses, payments, or damages resulting from any violation of the HIPAA Rules or breach of this **Downstream BAA** by Subcontractor or Subcontractor’s members, employees, agents, or subcontractors.

**2.7. Access to Information**. Within five (5) business days following Podium’s or a Covered Entity’s request, Subcontractor must make available to the related Covered Entity any PHI in Subcontractor’s control as necessary to enable the Covered Entity to satisfy its obligations to provide an individual with access to certain protected health information under 45 CFR § 164.524. If Subcontractor receives a request for access to PHI directly from an Individual, Subcontractor must forward such request to Podium within two (2) business days.

**2.8. Availability of PHI for Amendment**. Within ten (10) days following Podium’s or a Covered Entity’s request, make available to Podium any PHI for amendment and incorporate any amendments to PHI as necessary to enable the Covered Entity to satisfy its obligations under 45 CFR § 164.526. If Subcontractor receives a request for an amendment to PHI directly from an Individual, Subcontractor must forward such request to Podium within two (2) business days.

**2.9. Accounting of Disclosures**. Within five (5) business days of written notice by Podium to Subcontractor that Podium has received a request for an accounting of disclosures of PHI (other than disclosures to which an exception to the accounting requirement applies), Subcontractor must deliver to Podium such Information in Subcontractor's possession that is required for Podium to make the accounting required by 45 C.F.R. § 164.528. If Subcontractor receives a request for an accounting directly from an Individual, Subcontractor must forward such request to Podium within five (5) business days. Subcontractor will have no responsibility for providing an accounting to the Individual. Such accounting is limited to disclosures of PHI that were made in the six (6) years prior to the request and must be provided for as long as Subcontractor maintains the PHI.

**2.10. Records; Availability of Books and Records**. Subcontractor must maintain information concerning Subcontractor’s disclosures of PHI as required by 45 CFR § 164.528 and, within five (5) days following Podium’s or a Covered Entity’s request, make such information available to Podium and the Covered Entity as necessary to enable the Covered Entity to render an accounting of disclosures pursuant to 45 CFR § 164.528. In addition to any other such information, Subcontractor must document the following as to any impermissible disclosure: (i) the date of the disclosure; (ii) the name and address of the person or entity to whom the disclosure was made; (iii) a brief description of the protected health information disclosed; and (iv) a brief statement of the purpose of the disclosure. Subcontractor must promptly remedy any violation of any term of this **Downstream BAA** and must certify the same to Podium in writing. Subcontractor must make Subcontractor’s internal practices, books, and records relating to the use and disclosure of PHI received from or created or received by Subcontractor on behalf of Podium or a Covered Entity, available to the Secretary for purposes of determining a Covered Entity’s or Podium’s compliance with HIPAA. In addition, if and to the extent requested by Podium or a Covered Entity, Subcontractor must provide to Podium and the Covered Entity such proof of Subcontractor’s compliance with the requirements of this **Downstream BAA** as Podium or the Covered Entity will reasonably require.

**2.11. Indemnification**. Subcontractor agrees to indemnify, reimburse, defend, and hold harmless Podium for any costs, expenses, damages, fees, fines, settlements, judgments (including costs and attorney’s fees), and other losses incurred as a result of a breach of this **Downstream BAA**, Unauthorized Use or Disclosure, Security Incident, or any acts or omissions of Subcontractor or Subcontractor’s officers, members, employees, agents, or subcontractors arising out of the use and disclosure PHI or violation of the HIPAA Rules, or as a result of any negligence or willful misconduct by Subcontractor its agents or subcontractors, including, without limitation: fines or settlement amounts owed to a state or federal government agency; the cost of any notifications to Individuals or government agencies; credit monitoring for affected Individuals; or other mitigation steps taken by Podium to comply with HIPAA or state law.

**3\. ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS**

**3.1. Permissions**. Podium will notify Subcontractor of any changes in, or revocation of any permission by an Individual to use or disclose the Individual's PHI, to the extent that any such change or revocation affects Subcontractor's use or disclosure of PHI. Subcontractor must comply with any such change or revocation.

**3.2. Restrictions & Confidential Communications**. Podium will notify Subcontractor of any request for a restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI or confidential communication to which Podium has agreed in accordance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.522, to the extent that such agreed-upon restriction or confidential communication request may affect Subcontractor's use or disclosure of PHI. Subcontractor must comply with any such agreed-upon restriction or confidential communication request.

**3.3. Covered Entities' Notices of Privacy Practices**. Podium will notify Subcontractor of any limitation in a Covered Entity’s notice of privacy practices that limits Subcontractor's use or disclosure of PHI under this **Downstream BAA** Subcontractor must comply with such limitations.

**4\. TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT**

The term of this **Downstream BAA** will commence on the Effective Date of the [Developer Terms](https://partner-terms.podium.com/#developers) and will continue in full force and effect (and survive the expiration or earlier termination of this **Downstream BAA**) for so long as Subcontractor maintains any PHI.

**4.2. Termination**. Podium may terminate this **Downstream BAA** upon ten (10) days prior notice if Podium determines that Subcontractor or any Subcontractor’s subcontractor has violated the HIPAA Rules, a material term of this **Downstream BAA**, or otherwise engaged in conduct that may compromise the protected health information. Subcontractor will have the opportunity to cure the breach or violation within the 10-day notice period.

**PODIUM PREFERRED VENDOR GENERAL TERMS**

These terms and conditions, together with Partner’s applicable Preferred Vendor Agreement, are an agreement between you (“Partner” or “you”) and Podium Corporation, Inc. (“Podium,” “we,” or “us”). By clicking to accept these terms or by signing or clicking to accept any agreement referencing these Terms, you agree to all the applicable terms and conditions of these Podium Preferred Vendor General Terms (“Terms”) and Partner’s Applicable Preferred Vendor Agreement (together with the “Terms,” this Agreement”).

By accepting these Terms, you represent and warrant that you have the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement. If Partner is an entity, you represent and warrant that this Agreement is entered into by an employee or agent with all necessary authority to bind that entity to this Agreement.

We may periodically update these Terms. If we update or replace these Terms we will notify you in accordance with Section 11 below. If you have entered into another agreement with Podium concerning your role as a Podium partner, the terms of that agreement control in the event of any conflict with these Terms. Capitalized terms used in herein without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the applicable Preferred Vendor Agreement.

**1\. DATA & OWNERSHIP.**

The Parties agree that each Party shall retain all right, title, and interest worldwide in its inventions and all applicable intellectual property rights, as of the Effective Date or discovered, conceived, or reduced to practice by such Party during the Term. The Parties further agree that data transmitted under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, reports, structured data, and visual representations of data), together with all intellectual property rights in such data (“**Data**”), shall be owned as follows: (i) Data transferred by Partner to Podium (excluding any Data provided to Podium to which Partner would not otherwise have any ownership rights) shall be owned by Partner; (ii) Data stored in Podium’s platform shall be owned by Podium (excluding any Data provided by Partner to which Podium would not otherwise have any ownership rights).

**2\. PODIUM NAME AND TRADEMARK USAGE**

2.1. Use of Company Names. Podium may identify Partner in Podium advertising and marketing materials as a Podium partner. Partner may identify Podium as the supplier of the Podium Services in Partner’s advertising and marketing materials as approved in writing in advance by Podium, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

2.2. Use of Podium Trademarks. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, during the Term, Partner will have the right to advertise Podium Services with Podium trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos of Podium (“Podium Trademarks”), subject to Podium’s prior inspection and written approval of all materials bearing Podium Trademarks. Partner will fully comply with all guidelines, if any, communicated by Podium concerning the use of Podium Trademarks. Partner will not alter or remove any Podium Trademarks contained on or within the Podium Products. Additionally, Partner will not: (a) use the Podium Trademarks or variations or misspellings thereof in Partner’s business name, logo, branding, advertising, social media, or domain name (including without limitation top-level domains, sub-domains and page URLs), products, or services (including without limitation, in the name or design of any Application or Theme), unless granted express written permission by Podium in advance of each use; or (b) purchase or register search engine or other pay-per-click keywords (such as Google Ads), trademarks, email addresses, or domain names that use the Podium Trademarks or any variations or misspellings thereof that may be deceptively or confusingly similar to the Podium Trademarks.

2.3. Rights in Podium Trademarks. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained herein will grant or will be deemed to grant to Partner any right, title, or interest in or to Podium Trademarks. All uses of Podium Trademarks and related goodwill will inure solely to Podium. Partner will obtain no rights or goodwill with respect to any Podium Trademarks, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and Partner irrevocably assigns to Podium all such right, title, interest, and goodwill, if any, in any Podium Trademarks. At no time during or after the Term of this Agreement will Partner challenge or assist others to challenge any Podium Trademarks (except to the extent expressly required by applicable law) or the registration thereof or attempt to register any Podium Trademarks or marks or trade names that are confusingly similar to those of Podium.

2.4. Feedback. If Partner elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas, or other feedback or related materials to Podium with respect to Podium’s business operations or Services (collectively, "Feedback"), Partner hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

**3\. CONFIDENTIALITY.**

3.1. Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means code, inventions, know-how, product plans, technical and financial, business, operational, or other information exchanged under this Agreement or learned during the performance of this Agreement, or that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should reasonably be considered confidential based on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information disclosed. This includes any information relating to or shared by Podium as part of any data integration.

3.2. Obligation of Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each Party (as the receiving Party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to third parties; and (b) use the other Party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each Party may share the other Party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know provided that such Party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

3.3. Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving Party; (b) was known by the receiving Party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving Party from a third Party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving Party without using the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. A Party may also disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other Party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

3.4. Remedies. The Parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each Party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

**4\. INDEMNIFICATION.**

4.1. Partner Obligations. Partner will indemnify, defend and hold Podium harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (i) a breach or alleged breach of Partner’s obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that Partner has violated any law, rule, or regulation, or (iii) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any Member information provided to Podium by Partner. Partner also agrees to defend Podium against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Partner must not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts or take or refrain from taking any action.

4.2. Podium Obligations. Podium will indemnify, defend and hold Partner harmless from and against any third-party claims and related out-of-pocket costs, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses arising from or pertaining to (a) a breach or alleged breach of Podium’s obligations under this Agreement, (b) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that Podium has violated any law, rule, or regulation, and (c) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing its obligations under this Agreement. Podium also agrees to defend Partner against these claims at Partner’s request, but Partner may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense. Podium must not settle any claim without Partner’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Partner from liability or would require Partner to admit fault, pay any amounts or take or refrain from taking any action.

**5\. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.**

IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM, ITS SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT AND USE OF THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY ENROLLED MEMBERS TO PODIUM IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE AND CONTINUE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT DESPITE ANY FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION OR OF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SERVICES CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR FREE OR AT REDUCED PRICES, ONLY BECAUSE OF PODIUM’S RELIANCE UPON THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND THAT ALL SUCH LIMITATIONS FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. SOME STATES LIMIT THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS. IN THOSE STATES, THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.

**6\. NOTICES.**

Any notice or communication to Podium under this Agreement must be in writing. Client must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to [Podium Headquarters](https://www.podium.com/contact-us/) and include "Attn. Legal Department" in the subject line. Podium may send notices to the e-mail addresses listed on Partner’s Preferred Vendor Agreement or, at Podium’s option, to Partner’s last-known postal address.

**7\. NON-EXCLUSIVITY.**

The engagement contemplated under this Agreement between Partner and Podium will be on a non-exclusive basis, and nothing will prevent either Party from entering into other or similar agreements with other persons or entities.

**8\. PUBLICITY**.

Unless otherwise specified herein, Podium may use Partner’s name, logo and marks to identify Partner as a Podium partner and/or client on Podium’s Website and other marketing materials.

**9\. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.**

Although the term “partner” is used throughout the Agreement, the relationship of the parties established by this Agreement is that of independent contractors, and nothing contained in this Agreement should be construed to give either party the power to: (a) act as an agent; or (b) direct or control the day-to-day activities of the other. Financial and other obligations associated with each party’s business are the sole responsibility of that party. Neither Party is authorized to bind the other Party to any liability or obligation or to represent that such Party has any authority.

**10\. FORCE MAJEURE.**

Neither Party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, disruption in transportation systems, disruption of labor force, national or state emergency, epidemic, pandemic, communicable disease outbreak, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act or order.

**11\. AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.**

Podium may update or modify these Terms (including referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or by notification via the email associated with your Podium Partner account. If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance. Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Renewal Term. Immaterial modifications will become effective upon posting or notification. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each Party (each in its discretion). No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. No waiver of any provision of the Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such provision or any other provision or of the right to enforce such provision or any other provision. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party

**12\. Assignability.**

Partner may not assign its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement without Podium’s prior written consent, except in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale or exclusive license of all or substantially all of Partner’s assets to a party that could not reasonably be deemed a competitor of Podium. If consent is given, this Agreement will bind Partner’s successors and assigns. Any attempt by Partner to transfer its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement is void.

**13\. SEVERABILITY; BINDING EFFECT.**

If any provision of the Terms shall be invalid or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity and enforceability of any such provision in any other respect and of the remaining provisions of the terms shall not be impaired. The Terms shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their heirs, personal representatives, successors, and assigns.

**14\. NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES.**

Nothing in the Terms, express or implied, is intended to confer on any person, other than the Parties to the Terms, any right or remedy of any nature whatsoever.

**15\. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.**

This Agreement represents the Parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Podium Services or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement.

**16\. COUNTERPARTS; ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION.**

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more Parties hereto, and an executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more Parties hereto by facsimile or similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the signature of or on behalf of such Party can be seen, and such execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At the request of any Party hereto, all Parties hereto agree to execute an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or other reproduction hereof.

**17\. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE.**

This Agreement is governed by the laws of Utah, without regard to choice or conflict of law rules thereof. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be Utah, and both Parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

The audit report will be deemed to be Podium’s Confidential Information.

**PODIUM PHONES SERVICE TERMS**

  

By using or accessing Podium’s Phones Service (“**Phones**”) (formerly, Voice), or by signing or clicking to accept to any Subscription Documentation that includes Phones or references these terms, you (“**you**” or “**Client**”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “**Phones** **Service Terms**”).

These Phones Service Terms incorporate by this reference the Podium Terms of Service (currently available at: [https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us)) (the “**Podium Terms of Service**”) as may be updated from time to time, which, among other terms, contain provisions governing the resolution of claims (see Section 13 (Disclaimers), Section 14 (Limitations of Liability), Section 15 (Dispute Resolution), and Section 16 (General) of the Podium Terms of Service). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Phones Service Terms and the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), these Phones Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used herein without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Phones Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to the “**Agreement**” will include these Phones Service Terms.

**1**. **DEFINITIONS**

1.1. “**Phones** **Service Provider(s)**” means the third-party service provider(s) used by Podium to facilitate certain features of Phones. Podium may add or remove Phones Service Providers from time to time.

1.2. “**Desk Phone** **Products**” or “**Desk Phones**” means the physical device and any hardware and accessories provided or made available by Podium as part of Phones. Any software and/or firmware preinstalled on, or distributed with, the Desk Phone Products forms part of the Desk Phone Products. Desk Phones are currently available to Phones clients in the United States only.

1.3. “**Web Phone**” means the software-based phone available within the Phones desktop application (“Desktop Web Phone”) or the Phones mobile application (“Mobile Web Phone”) that allows Podium clients to make phone calls through a properly equipped and configured computer or mobile device, without the need for Desk Phone Products.

**2**. **SERVICES.**

2.1. Podium Phones. Podium Phones is a voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) phone system integrated with Podium software to support communication with Client’s Customers. Subject to the performance of Client’s duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide Client with access to Phones. Podium Phones includes software, hardware, and other related elements. In order to access and fully use Phones, Client must register for and maintain an active account and Subscription with Podium. Client understands and agrees that Phones may be used in the United States and Australia only. Podium Phones is powered by Podium Voice, LLC, which is a regulated affiliate of Podium. Podium Voice, LLC is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and will be entitled to enforce the terms and conditions as if it were a party to the Agreement.

2.2. Phones Professional Network Optimization. Phones Professional Network Optimization ("Network Optimization") is a program Podium makes available whereby we connect you with certain Third-Party Providers to perform Network Optimization services that may include: (a) assessment of your network to support VoIP compatibility and sufficient speed; (b) updating your network settings and configuration to improve performance (includes running up to 1 ethernet line (< 50 feet)); (c) recommendations for network and hardware updates; (d) a physical desk phone installation session; (e) 30-day (from the date of installation), limited warranty services provided. Network Optimization is available to Phones clients in the United States only.

2.2.1. Podium does not perform your Network Optimization and has no responsibility or liability for the Network Optimization services. Podium partners with certain Third-Party Providers, who are independent of Podium, who will provide the Network Optimization services you purchase. These providers are not employees, subcontractors, or agents of Podium. For your convenience, you will pay for the Network Optimization services as defined above through Podium, who will accept payment on behalf of the Third-Party Provider that completes your Network Optimization. The Third-Party Provider may have additional terms and conditions, which Client may be required to accept prior to receiving the Network Optimization. Additionally, if you purchase or wish to purchase any additional services from the Third-Party Provider, beyond those expressly described herein or on your applicable Subscription Documentation, you must contract with and pay any applicable fees to the Third-Party Provider directly.

2.2.2. By purchasing Network Optimization, Client authorizes Podium to share Client’s contact information with a Third-Party Provider and, as necessary, to allow the Third-Party Provider to access Client’s Podium Platform account for the purposes of providing Network Optimization services. Podium will not be responsible or liable in any manner for any negligent or intentional acts of the Third-Party Provider relating to the Network Optimization services or Client’s Podium account.

**3**. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS**.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools. Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable Law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

3.4. Account Use and Security. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Phones Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client acknowledges that placing telephones on a publicly accessible internet protocol address or a publicly accessible network will subject it to a higher level of risk for fraudulent activity. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Additionally, unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, your use of Phones is subject to the applicable Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Network Optimization, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Network Optimization and any applicable Network Optimization warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Network Optimization, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

**4**. **TERM AND TERMINATION**

4.1. This Agreement will begin on the start date of the applicable Subscription Documentation for Phones and will remain in effect until the applicable Subscription Term has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted by your Subscription Documentation.

**5**. **OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS.**

5.1. These Phones Service Terms do not grant any rights or licenses in Phones, Desk Phone Products, Podium Technology, or related software other than as expressly stated in these Phones Service Terms. As between the parties, Podium owns all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Phones, Desk Phone Products, and software.

6.1. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Phones is provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Agreement, as applicable. Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle, including Phones (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Agreement (collectively, the “Fees”). Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

6.2. Client will be responsible for all applicable taxes and fees accrued through Client’s use of Phones. These charges may change from time to time and vary depending on federal, state, and local rules. Podium may charge Client for applicable taxes and fees through Client’s invoice.

**7**. **DESK** **PHONE PRODUCTS.**

7.1. Desk Phone Products are manufactured by third parties and are resold by Podium. All Desk Phone Products features, specifications, and prices are subject to change at any time. Podium does not warrant that product descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free, or that the Desk Phone Products are available for lease or purchase. Podium is not obligated to accept any Subscription Documentation for the purchase of Desk Phone Products, and Podium may cancel accepted Subscription Documentation at any time if Podium is unable to fulfill the purchase request for any reason. If Podium cancels your Subscription Documentation for the purchase of Desk Phone Products because it is unable to fulfill the purchase request for any reason, Podium will fully refund the purchase fees prepaid by you for such Desk Phone Products.

7.2. The following terms apply to Desk Phone Products purchased by Client (as specified in Client’s Subscription Documentation):

7.2.1. Podium will deliver the Desk Phone Products to the delivery address specified in your Subscription Documentation, at which time risk of loss will pass to you. Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with an estimated delivery date for each Desk Phone Product; however, such delivery date is a good-faith estimate only and is not binding on Podium.

7.2.2. Title to each Desk Phone Product will transfer to you upon: (a) your payment of all applicable purchase fees in respect of such Desk Phone Product and (b) delivery of the Desk Phone Product in accordance with this Section 7, whichever is later.

Podium may make updates to the Desk Phone Products available to you. You must install these updates to continue using the Desk Phone Products. Podium will not be obligated to provide services or support for any outdated versions. Any updates are subject to these Phones Service Terms unless other terms are provided with the updates.

7.6. Unless otherwise expressly provided in an applicable Subscription Documentation, Client will pay the purchase fee in full upon placing the order for purchase of the Desk Phone Product.

**8**. **LIMITED DESK PHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port (i.e., transfer) your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. By authorizing the porting process, you understand and agree that: (a) the ability to complete the port is subject to validation that your number(s)/service can be ported; (b) you may experience an interruption or change to your telecommunications service during or as a result of the porting process, and Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control; (c) if you are ending an existing contract with your current telecommunications provider early as part of the porting process, you may have to pay a cancellation fee or penalty to that provider and you are solely responsible for any such fee or penalty; (d) Podium will use reasonable efforts to notify you that the porting process is complete when it occurs. Additionally, if you have any questions or complaints about the porting process, you can contact our Customer Support team [here](https://www.podium.com/knowledgebase/s/article/Contact-Support#:~:text=Contact%20Podium%20Support%20via%20Phone,AM%20-%206:00%20PM%20MST).

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers.

Podium Phones includes software, hardware, and other related elements. In order to access and fully use Phones, Client must register for and maintain an active account and Subscription with Podium. Client understands and agrees that Phones may be used in the United States and Australia only. Podium Phones is powered by Podium Voice, LLC, which is a regulated affiliate of Podium.

These providers are not employees, subcontractors, or agents of Podium. For your convenience, you will pay for the Network Optimization services as defined above through Podium, who will accept payment on behalf of the Third-Party Provider that completes your Network Optimization. The Third-Party Provider may have additional terms and conditions, which Client may be required to accept prior to receiving the Network Optimization. Additionally, if you purchase or wish to purchase any additional services from the Third-Party Provider, beyond those expressly described herein or on your applicable Subscription Documentation, you must contract with and pay any applicable fees to the Third-Party Provider directly.

2.2.2. By purchasing Network Optimization, Client authorizes Podium to share Client’s contact information with a Third-Party Provider and, as necessary, to allow the Third-Party Provider to access Client’s Podium Platform account for the purposes of providing Network Optimization services. Podium will not be responsible or liable in any manner for any negligent or intentional acts of the Third-Party Provider relating to the Network Optimization services or Client’s Podium account.

**3**. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS**.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools. Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable Law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

3.4. Account Use and Security. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Phones Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client acknowledges that placing telephones on a publicly accessible internet protocol address or a publicly accessible network will subject it to a higher level of risk for fraudulent activity. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Additionally, unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, your use of Phones is subject to the applicable Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Network Optimization, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Network Optimization and any applicable Network Optimization warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Network Optimization, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

**4**. **TERM AND TERMINATION**

4.1. This Agreement will begin on the start date of the applicable Subscription Documentation for Phones and will remain in effect until the applicable Subscription Term has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted by your Subscription Documentation.

**5**. **OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS.**

5.1. These Phones Service Terms do not grant any rights or licenses in Phones, Desk Phone Products, Podium Technology, or related software other than as expressly stated in these Phones Service Terms.

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

6.2. Client will be responsible for all applicable taxes and fees accrued through Client’s use of Phones. These charges may change from time to time and vary depending on federal, state, and local rules. Podium may charge Client for applicable taxes and fees through Client’s invoice.

Podium is not obligated to accept any Subscription Documentation for the purchase of Desk Phone Products, and Podium may cancel accepted Subscription Documentation at any time if Podium is unable to fulfill the purchase request for any reason. If Podium cancels your Subscription Documentation for the purchase of Desk Phone Products because it is unable to fulfill the purchase request for any reason, Podium will fully refund the purchase fees prepaid by you for such Desk Phone Products.

7.2. The following terms apply to Desk Phone Products purchased by Client (as specified in Client’s Subscription Documentation):

7.2.1. Podium will deliver the Desk Phone Products to the delivery address specified in your Subscription Documentation, at which time risk of loss will pass to you.

**8**. **LIMITED DESK PHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port (i.e., transfer) your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. By authorizing the porting process, you understand and agree that: (a) the ability to complete the port is subject to validation that your number(s)/service can be ported; (b) you may experience an interruption or change to your telecommunications service during or as a result of the porting process, and Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control; (c) if you are ending an existing contract with your current telecommunications provider early as part of the porting process, you may have to pay a cancellation fee or penalty to that provider and you are solely responsible for any such fee or penalty; (d) Podium will use reasonable efforts to notify you that the porting process is complete when it occurs. Additionally, if you have any questions or complaints about the porting process, you can contact our Customer Support team [here](https://www.podium.com/knowledgebase/s/article/Contact-Support#:~:text=Contact%20Podium%20Support%20via%20Phone,AM%20-%206:00%20PM%20MST).

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services.

Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Additionally, unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, your use of Phones is subject to the applicable Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Network Optimization, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Network Optimization and any applicable Network Optimization warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Network Optimization, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights.

THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port (i.e., transfer) your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. By authorizing the porting process, you understand and agree that: (a) the ability to complete the port is subject to validation that your number(s)/service can be ported; (b) you may experience an interruption or change to your telecommunications service during or as a result of the porting process, and Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control; (c) if you are ending an existing contract with your current telecommunications provider early as part of the porting process, you may have to pay a cancellation fee or penalty to that provider and you are solely responsible for any such fee or penalty; (d) Podium will use reasonable efforts to notify you that the porting process is complete when it occurs. Additionally, if you have any questions or complaints about the porting process, you can contact our Customer Support team [here](https://www.podium.com/knowledgebase/s/article/Contact-Support#:~:text=Contact%20Podium%20Support%20via%20Phone,AM%20-%206:00%20PM%20MST).

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

3.4. Account Use and Security. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Phones Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client acknowledges that placing telephones on a publicly accessible internet protocol address or a publicly accessible network will subject it to a higher level of risk for fraudulent activity. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Additionally, unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, your use of Phones is subject to the applicable Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Network Optimization, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Network Optimization and any applicable Network Optimization warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Network Optimization, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

**4**. **TERM AND TERMINATION**

**5**. **OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS.**

7.2. The following terms apply to Desk Phone Products purchased by Client (as specified in Client’s Subscription Documentation):

7.2.1. Podium will deliver the Desk Phone Products to the delivery address specified in your Subscription Documentation, at which time risk of loss will pass to you.

**8**. **LIMITED DESK PHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port (i.e., transfer) your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. By authorizing the porting process, you understand and agree that: (a) the ability to complete the port is subject to validation that your number(s)/service can be ported; (b) you may experience an interruption or change to your telecommunications service during or as a result of the porting process, and Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control; (c) if you are ending an existing contract with your current telecommunications provider early as part of the porting process, you may have to pay a cancellation fee or penalty to that provider and you are solely responsible for any such fee or penalty; (d) Podium will use reasonable efforts to notify you that the porting process is complete when it occurs. Additionally, if you have any questions or complaints about the porting process, you can contact our Customer Support team [here](https://www.podium.com/knowledgebase/s/article/Contact-Support#:~:text=Contact%20Podium%20Support%20via%20Phone,AM%20-%206:00%20PM%20MST).

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

**3**. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS**.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools. Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable Law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control.

You will also be required to: 1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Network Optimization and any applicable Network Optimization warranty period.

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port (i.e., transfer) your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. By authorizing the porting process, you understand and agree that: (a) the ability to complete the port is subject to validation that your number(s)/service can be ported; (b) you may experience an interruption or change to your telecommunications service during or as a result of the porting process, and Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control; (c) if you are ending an existing contract with your current telecommunications provider early as part of the porting process, you may have to pay a cancellation fee or penalty to that provider and you are solely responsible for any such fee or penalty; (d) Podium will use reasonable efforts to notify you that the porting process is complete when it occurs. Additionally, if you have any questions or complaints about the porting process, you can contact our Customer Support team [here](https://www.podium.com/knowledgebase/s/article/Contact-Support#:~:text=Contact%20Podium%20Support%20via%20Phone,AM%20-%206:00%20PM%20MST).

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

**3**. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS**.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools. Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable Law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality.

If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Network Optimization and any applicable Network Optimization warranty period.

3.5.3.

7.4. You will not, and neither will you permit any third party to: (a) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell, or distribute in any way, any data, content, or any part of a Desk Phone Product; (b) work around any of the technical limitations implemented in a Desk Phone Product or enable functionality that is disabled or prohibited; (c) reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer a Desk Phone Products except as expressly permitted by applicable Law; (d) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the normal operation of a Desk Phone Product or impact the use of the Desk Phone Products by other users; (e) use the Desk Phone Products in any manner not permitted hereunder or for any purpose other than commercial purposes; (f) use the Desk Phone Product in any location other than the registered location or move the Desk Phone Products to a new location without registering the device to its new location; (g) remove, modify, deface, or replace any of Podium’s or any Phones Service Provider’s proprietary notices or marks which appear on or are affixed to a Desk Phone Product; or (h) use the Desk Phone Products to violate any applicable Laws, including any laws and regulations related to notification and consumer protection, unfair competition, privacy, and false advertising, and any other laws relevant to the Desk Phone Products.

Podium will not be obligated to provide services or support for any outdated versions. Any updates are subject to these Phones Service Terms unless other terms are provided with the updates.

7.6. Unless otherwise expressly provided in an applicable Subscription Documentation, Client will pay the purchase fee in full upon placing the order for purchase of the Desk Phone Product.

**8**. **LIMITED DESK PHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port (i.e., transfer) your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. By authorizing the porting process, you understand and agree that: (a) the ability to complete the port is subject to validation that your number(s)/service can be ported; (b) you may experience an interruption or change to your telecommunications service during or as a result of the porting process, and Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control; (c) if you are ending an existing contract with your current telecommunications provider early as part of the porting process, you may have to pay a cancellation fee or penalty to that provider and you are solely responsible for any such fee or penalty; (d) Podium will use reasonable efforts to notify you that the porting process is complete when it occurs. Additionally, if you have any questions or complaints about the porting process, you can contact our Customer Support team [here](https://www.podium.com/knowledgebase/s/article/Contact-Support#:~:text=Contact%20Podium%20Support%20via%20Phone,AM%20-%206:00%20PM%20MST).

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

These Phones Service Terms incorporate by this reference the Podium Terms of Service (currently available at: [https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us)) (the “**Podium Terms of Service**”) as may be updated from time to time, which, among other terms, contain provisions governing the resolution of claims (see Section 13 (Disclaimers), Section 14 (Limitations of Liability), Section 15 (Dispute Resolution), and Section 16 (General) of the Podium Terms of Service). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Phones Service Terms and the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), these Phones Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used herein without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Phones Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to the “**Agreement**” will include these Phones Service Terms.

**1**. **DEFINITIONS**

**2**. **SERVICES.**

2.1. Podium Phones. Podium Phones is a voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) phone system integrated with Podium software to support communication with Client’s Customers. Subject to the performance of Client’s duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide Client with access to Phones. Podium Phones includes software, hardware, and other related elements. In order to access and fully use Phones, Client must register for and maintain an active account and Subscription with Podium. Client understands and agrees that Phones may be used in the United States only. Podium Phones is powered by Podium Voice, LLC, which is a regulated affiliate of Podium. Podium Voice, LLC is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and will be entitled to enforce the terms and conditions as if it were a party to the Agreement.

2.2.1. Podium does not perform your Network Optimization and has no responsibility or liability for the Network Optimization services.

These providers are not employees, subcontractors, or agents of Podium. For your convenience, you will pay for the Network Optimization services as defined above through Podium, who will accept payment on behalf of the Third-Party Provider that completes your Network Optimization. The Third-Party Provider may have additional terms and conditions, which Client may be required to accept prior to receiving the Network Optimization. Additionally, if you purchase or wish to purchase any additional services from the Third-Party Provider, beyond those expressly described herein or on your applicable Subscription Documentation, you must contract with and pay any applicable fees to the Third-Party Provider directly.

2.2.2. By purchasing Network Optimization, Client authorizes Podium to share Client’s contact information with a Third-Party Provider and, as necessary, to allow the Third-Party Provider to access Client’s Podium Platform account for the purposes of providing Network Optimization services. Podium will not be responsible or liable in any manner for any negligent or intentional acts of the Third-Party Provider relating to the Network Optimization services or Client’s Podium account.

**3**. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS**.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools. Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable Law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

3.4. Account Use and Security. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Phones Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client acknowledges that placing telephones on a publicly accessible internet protocol address or a publicly accessible network will subject it to a higher level of risk for fraudulent activity. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Additionally, unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, your use of Phones is subject to the applicable Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Network Optimization, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Network Optimization; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Network Optimization and any applicable Network Optimization warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Network Optimization, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

**4**. **TERM AND TERMINATION**

**5**. **OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS.**

If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you.

To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control.

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

Capitalized terms used herein without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Phones Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time.

**2**. **SERVICES.**

2.1. Podium Phones. Podium Phones is a voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) phone system integrated with Podium software to support communication with Client’s Customers. Subject to the performance of Client’s duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide Client with access to Phones. Podium Phones includes software, hardware, and other related elements. In order to access and fully use Phones, Client must register for and maintain an active account and Subscription with Podium. Client understands and agrees that Phones may be used in the United States only. Podium Phones is powered by Podium Voice, LLC, which is a regulated affiliate of Podium.

2.2.1. Podium does not perform your Phones Professional Installation and has no responsibility or liability for the installation.

These providers are not employees, subcontractors, or agents of Podium. For your convenience, you will pay for the Phones Professional Installation services as defined above through Podium, who will accept payment on behalf of the Third-Party Provider that completes your Phones Professional Installation. The Third-Party Provider may have additional terms and conditions, which Client may be required to accept prior to receiving the Phones Professional Installation. Additionally, if you purchase or wish to purchase any additional services from the Third-Party Provider, beyond those expressly described herein or on your applicable Subscription Documentation, you must contract with and pay any applicable fees to the Third-Party Provider directly.

2.2.2. By purchasing Phones Professional Installation, Client authorizes Podium to share Client’s contact information with a Third-Party Provider and, as necessary, to allow the Third-Party Provider to access Client’s Podium Platform account for the purposes of providing Phones Professional Installation services. Podium will not be responsible or liable in any manner for any negligent or intentional acts of the Third-Party Provider relating to the Phones Professional Installation services or Client’s Podium account.

**3**. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS**.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools. Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable Law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

3.4. Account Use and Security. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Phones Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client acknowledges that placing telephones on a publicly accessible internet protocol address or a publicly accessible network will subject it to a higher level of risk for fraudulent activity. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Additionally, unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, your use of Phones is subject to the applicable Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Phones Professional Installation, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Phones Professional Installation and any applicable Phones Professional Installation warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Phones Professional Installation, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

**5**. **OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS.**

7.2. The following terms apply to Desk Phone Products purchased by Client (as specified in Client’s Subscription Documentation):

7.2.1. Podium will deliver the Desk Phone Products to the delivery address specified in your Subscription Documentation, at which time risk of loss will pass to you.

**8**. **LIMITED DESK PHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control.

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

By using or accessing Podium’s Phones Service (“**Phones**”) (formerly, Voice), or by signing or clicking to accept to any Subscription Documentation that includes Phones or references these terms, you (“**you**” or “**Client**”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “**Phones** **Service Terms**”).

These Phones Service Terms incorporate by this reference the Podium Terms of Service (currently available at: [https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us)) (the “**Podium Terms of Service**”) as may be updated from time to time, which, among other terms, contain provisions governing the resolution of claims (see Section 13 (Disclaimers), Section 14 (Limitations of Liability), Section 15 (Dispute Resolution), and Section 16 (General) of the Podium Terms of Service). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Phones Service Terms and the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), these Phones Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used herein without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Phones Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to the “**Agreement**” will include these Phones Service Terms.

**1**. **DEFINITIONS**

1.1. “**Phones** **Service Provider(s)**” means the third-party service provider(s) used by Podium to facilitate certain features of Phones. Podium may add or remove Phones Service Providers from time to time.

1.2. “**Desk Phone** **Products**” or “**Desk Phones**” means the physical device and any hardware and accessories provided or made available by Podium as part of Phones. Any software and/or firmware preinstalled on, or distributed with, the Desk Phone Products forms part of the Desk Phone Products.

1.3. “**Web Phone**” means the software-based phone available within the Phones desktop application (“Desktop Web Phone”) or the Phones mobile application (“Mobile Web Phone”) that allows Podium clients to make phone calls through a properly equipped and configured computer or mobile device, without the need for Desk Phone Products.

**2**. **SERVICES.**

2.1. Podium Phones. Podium Phones is a voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) phone system integrated with Podium software to support communication with Client’s Customers. Subject to the performance of Client’s duties and obligations under the Agreement (including any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation), Podium will provide Client with access to Phones. Podium Phones includes software, hardware, and other related elements. In order to access and fully use Phones, Client must register for and maintain an active account and Subscription with Podium. Client understands and agrees that Phones may be used in the United States only. Podium Phones is powered by Podium Voice, LLC, which is a regulated affiliate of Podium. Podium Voice, LLC is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and will be entitled to enforce the terms and conditions as if it were a party to the Agreement.

2.2. Phones Professional Installation. Phones Professional Installation ("Phones Professional Installation") is a program Podium makes available whereby we connect you with certain Third-Party Providers to perform installation services that may include: (a) assessment of your network to support VoIP compatibility and sufficient speed; (b) updating your network settings and configuration to improve performance (includes running up to 1 ethernet line (<50 feet)); (c) recommendations for network and hardware updates; (d) a physical desk phone installation session; (e) 30-day (from the date of installation), limited warranty services provided.

2.2.1. Podium does not perform your Phones Professional Installation and has no responsibility or liability for the installation. Podium partners with certain Third-Party Providers, who are independent of Podium, who will provide the Phones Professional Installation services you purchase. These providers are not employees, subcontractors, or agents of Podium. For your convenience, you will pay for the Phones Professional Installation services as defined above through Podium, who will accept payment on behalf of the Third-Party Provider that completes your Phones Professional Installation. The Third-Party Provider may have additional terms and conditions, which Client may be required to accept prior to receiving the Phones Professional Installation. Additionally, if you purchase or wish to purchase any additional services from the Third-Party Provider, beyond those expressly described herein or on your applicable Subscription Documentation, you must contract with and pay any applicable fees to the Third-Party Provider directly.

2.2.2. By purchasing Phones Professional Installation, Client authorizes Podium to share Client’s contact information with a Third-Party Provider and, as necessary, to allow the Third-Party Provider to access Client’s Podium Platform account for the purposes of providing Phones Professional Installation services. Podium will not be responsible or liable in any manner for any negligent or intentional acts of the Third-Party Provider relating to the Phones Professional Installation services or Client’s Podium account.

**3**. **CLIENT OBLIGATIONS**.

3.1. Client Data. In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools. Podium may disclose Client Data pursuant to a data subject access request or consumer data request as required by applicable Law, provided that to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Podium notify Client of any such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

3.4. Account Use and Security. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Phones Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client acknowledges that placing telephones on a publicly accessible internet protocol address or a publicly accessible network will subject it to a higher level of risk for fraudulent activity. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Additionally, unless otherwise specified in your applicable Subscription Documentation, your use of Phones is subject to the applicable Scope of Use limits listed at [https://www.podium.com/pricing/](https://www.podium.com/pricing/). Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. If specific Scope of Use Limits have not been expressly designated for your Phones Services, or the Services you’ve purchased have been designated as “unlimited”, such Services are intended (and may be used only) for normal business use in compliance with the Agreement, including the AUP and your Subscription Documentation. Because any unusually high or excessive usage of Phones, or use of Phones beyond any applicable Scope of Use limit(s), may impair Podium’s ability to provide the Services to you and other Podium users, in the event that Podium discovers or reasonably suspects the occurrence of excessive, unauthorized, or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop such usage (including suspending or terminating your use of or access to the Services) without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Phones Professional Installation, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Phones Professional Installation and any applicable Phones Professional Installation warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Phones Professional Installation, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

**4**. **TERM AND TERMINATION**

4.1. This Agreement will begin on the start date of the applicable Subscription Documentation for Phones and will remain in effect until the applicable Subscription Term has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted by your Subscription Documentation.

**5**. **OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS.**

5.1. These Phones Service Terms do not grant any rights or licenses in Phones, Desk Phone Products, Podium Technology, or related software other than as expressly stated in these Phones Service Terms.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

**6**. **FEES AND PAYMENT.**

6.1. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, Phones is provided on an ongoing, per-license subscription basis, including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Agreement, as applicable. Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle, including Phones (“Subscription Fees”) and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation or Agreement (collectively, the “Fees”). Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

6.2. Client will be responsible for all applicable taxes and fees accrued through Client’s use of Phones. These charges may change from time to time and vary depending on federal, state, and local rules. Podium may charge Client for applicable taxes and fees through Client’s invoice.

7.1. Desk Phone Products are manufactured by third parties and are resold by Podium. All Desk Phone Products features, specifications, and prices are subject to change at any time. Podium does not warrant that product descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free, or that the Desk Phone Products are available for lease or purchase. Podium is not obligated to accept any Subscription Documentation for the purchase of Desk Phone Products, and Podium may cancel accepted Subscription Documentation at any time if Podium is unable to fulfill the purchase request for any reason. If Podium cancels your Subscription Documentation for the purchase of Desk Phone Products because it is unable to fulfill the purchase request for any reason, Podium will fully refund the purchase fees prepaid by you for such Desk Phone Products.

7.2. The following terms apply to Desk Phone Products purchased by Client (as specified in Client’s Subscription Documentation):

7.2.1. Podium will deliver the Desk Phone Products to the delivery address specified in your Subscription Documentation, at which time risk of loss will pass to you. Podium will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with an estimated delivery date for each Desk Phone Product; however, such delivery date is a good-faith estimate only and is not binding on Podium.

7.2.2. Title to each Desk Phone Product will transfer to you upon: (a) your payment of all applicable purchase fees in respect of such Desk Phone Product and (b) delivery of the Desk Phone Product in accordance with this Section 7, whichever is later.

7.2.3. Client must immediately notify Podium in the event a Desk Phone is lost or stolen after it has been received by Client.

7.3. Your use of the Desk Phone Products is: (a) subject to the terms of the [Podium Terms of Service](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us), [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), these Phones Service Terms, and any additional terms set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation; (b) limited to use in conjunction with the Phones and Desk Phone Services and other Podium Services; and (c) limited to use by competent trained employees, authorized by Client to operate or use Desk Phone Products, and with adequate security measures in place to safeguard Desk Phone Products and data collected by, and held on, Desk Phone Products.

Podium will not be obligated to provide services or support for any outdated versions. Any updates are subject to these Phones Service Terms unless other terms are provided with the updates.

7.6. Unless otherwise expressly provided in an applicable Subscription Documentation, Client will pay the purchase fee in full upon placing the order for purchase of the Desk Phone Product.

**8**. **LIMITED DESK PHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control.

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

In addition to Client’s obligations under the Podium Terms of Service, Client agrees that where Client provides or makes available to Podium (or a Phones Service Provider, as applicable) any Client Data (including without limitation, Personal Data about Customers) in connection with Client’s use of Phones, Client grants Podium, and its respective affiliates, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, fully-paid-up, and irrevocable, right to (i) to collect, use, retain, transfer, and disclose Client Data (including to Podium’s and Phones Service Provider’s third-party service providers) in order to provide the Phones Services to Client and (ii) to enable Phones Service Provider(s) to use Client Data to: (a) provide the Phones Service Provider’s services to its (and its affiliates) other clients, as necessary; and (b) analyze and improve, and incorporate Client Data into, the Phones Service Provider’s products, systems, and tools.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Podium will be permitted to retain and use Client Data (to the extent such use is permitted under these Phones Service Terms) after the expiration or termination of your applicable Subscription Documentation.

3.2. Compliance with Laws and Terms. Client understands and agrees that Client will, for the duration of the Subscription Term: (a) provide all required disclosures to Customers and obtain all required consents and/or authorizations from Customers, based on applicable Laws, prior to utilizing Phones; (b) obtain all necessary rights, releases, and consents to allow Client Data to be collected, used, and disclosed in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to grant Podium the rights herein; and (c) use Phones only in compliance with all Laws, the terms of this Agreement, including Podium’s Acceptable Use Policy (“**Acceptable Use Policy**”) (currently available at [https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us)), and industry-specific best practices, including but not limited to Do Not Call rules and prohibitions. Client agrees and acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for its (and its Authorized Users') compliance with applicable Laws, these Phones Service Terms, and the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us) and must not rely on the Services for any such compliance. Use of the Services does not guarantee compliance with applicable Laws or the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://legal.podium.com/#aup-us), and Podium expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s non-compliance. Client also understands and agrees that it must not make any attempts to break or circumvent any security measures or rate limits of the Services, or to evade detection of a violation of these Phones Service Terms or the Law when using the Services. Podium reserves the right to suspend or terminate Client’s access to the Services or specific feature(s) of the Services if Podium believes, in its sole discretion, that Client has violated these Phones Service Terms.

3.3. Recording. Client understands and agrees that the Services may include certain features or functionality that allow Client to record or transcribe certain audio and other data related to communications made using the Services. If Client uses this functionality, Client is solely responsible for complying (and ensuring all its Authorized Users comply) with applicable Laws in the jurisdictions in which it uses this functionality. Podium disclaims all liability for your use of these recording and transcribing features, and you agree to hold Podium harmless for all liabilities related to your use of these features.

3.4. Account Use and Security. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Phones Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client acknowledges that placing telephones on a publicly accessible internet protocol address or a publicly accessible network will subject it to a higher level of risk for fraudulent activity. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. In the event that Podium discovers or has reason to believe the occurrence of unauthorized or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary to prevent or stop, without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a VoIP phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Phones Professional Installation, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Phones Professional Installation and any applicable Phones Professional Installation warranty period.

3.5.3. Additionally, Clients understands and agrees that, whether or not it purchases Phones Professional Installation, Client may not cancel or otherwise terminate its Phones Subscription, nor will Podium provide any refunds or service credits, due to network, hardware, or other issues caused by factors outside Podium’s direct control.

**8**. **LIMITED DESK PHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. Port-In Requests. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization (“LOA”) provided to you by Podium, including all required information, and authorizing Podium and its Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication that may occur during the porting process or for any delays or failures in the porting process that are caused by factors outside Podium’s control.

9.2. Port-Out Requests. As required by Law, Podium will comply with a valid request to port the number associated with your Phones account to another service provider. You understand and agree, however, that any such port-out request does not relieve you of any payment or other contractual obligations remaining under your existing agreement with Podium at the time of the request, and that you will be responsible to pay any remaining balance owed to Podium even after the port-out has been completed. You may also be subject to fees or charges applicable to the port-out request, which Podium may communicate to you in writing prior to or at the time of your port-out request. Additionally, you understand and agree that you must provide to Podium all documentation and information necessary to complete the port-out request, follow all processes required by Podium and the service provider to which you are porting your number in order to facilitate the request, and comply with all Laws and any third-party terms applicable to your port-out request. Podium will not be responsible for any delays or failures in the porting process, if such delays or failures are caused by factors outside Podium’s control, or for any service interruptions or downtime that occurs during the porting.

9.3. Number Releases. Upon termination of your Podium account, including your Phones services, any phone numbers associated with your account which have not been previously ported to another service provider may be released. You must, therefore, ensure that you coordinate the porting of your number before your Podium Subscription ends or is otherwise terminated.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones, and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

In the event that Podium discovers or has reason to believe the occurrence of unauthorized or prohibited usage of Phones, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary, without prior notice.

3.5. Responsibility for System and Technical Requirements. Client understands and agrees that Phones is a voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) phone service and there are many factors that may impact Client's ability to use Phones, including but not limited to network speeds and bandwidth, network connectivity, hardware, and other factors outside Podium’s control. Except for the limited scope of services and warranty available to Client upon the purchase of Phones Professional Installation, Client remains solely responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other technical requirements necessary to enable its use of Phones.

3.5.1. Where possible, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Phones. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test. If, following this initial test, your network quality does not meet the minimum requirements to support Phones, before you may purchase a Phones Subscription, you will be required to: (1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements. You will also be required to: 1) purchase Phones Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if Podium is unable to perform a pre-purchase network test, or your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, performed by Podium during the post-purchase onboarding process.

3.5.2. Client understands and agrees that it is fully responsible for maintaining sufficient internet access, network connectivity, power, and other system and technical requirements necessary to enable the use of Phones, including following the completion of any purchased Phones Professional Installation and any applicable Phones Professional Installation warranty period.

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Desk Phone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Desk Phone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Desk Phone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Desk Phone Product, replace the Desk Phone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Desk Phone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Desk Phone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Desk Phone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Desk Phone Products.

8.3. **THE PHONES SERVICES AND DESK PHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE PHONES TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DESK PHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A DESK PHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Desk Phone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Phones Term of Service.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Desk Phone(s) & Desktop Web Phone(s). When you use a Desk Phone or the Desktop Web Phone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Web Phones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Web Phone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Web Phone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential user(s) of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Desk Phone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

**8**. **LIMITED HARDPHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.**

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Hardphone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Hardphone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Hardphone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Hardphone Product, replace the Hardphone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Hardphone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Hardphone Products that are used in accordance with these Phones Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Hardphone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Phones Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights.

THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A HARDPHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Hardphone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

**9**. **PHONE NUMBER PORTING.**

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Phones, you must execute a letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Phones Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date; (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Phones Term of Service.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Phones is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Phones operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Phones, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Phones and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Phones Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Hardphone(s) & Desktop Softphone. When you use a Hardphone or the Desktop Softphone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Softphones) to make an emergency call, Phones relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Phones account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Phones account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Phones will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF PHONES FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Phones phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Phones Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Phones Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Phones Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Softphone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Softphone on your own device, the Phones application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Phones Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Phones will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Podium Phones services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Phones services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM PHONES IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Phones, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Phones emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Hardphone you or your End Users may use in connection with Phones services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Phones of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Phones for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Phones to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

Client is responsible for complying, and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client’s use of Voice.

Client is solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials.

3.4.1. To support Client in its ability to use Voice, Podium will perform a network quality test prior to your purchase of Voice. This test will assess download and upload speeds, download and upload packet loss, as well as the number of devices on your network at the time of the test.

You will also be required to: 1) purchase Voice Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, which Podium will perform during the post-purchase onboarding process.

**10**. **EMERGENCY SERVICES**

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Voice is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Voice operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Voice, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Voice and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Voice Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Hardphone(s) & Desktop Softphone. When you use a Hardphone or the Desktop Softphone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Softphones) to make an emergency call, Voice relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Voice account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Voice account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Voice will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF VOICE FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Voice phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Voice Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Voice Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Voice Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Softphone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Softphone on your own device, the Voice application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Voice Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Voice will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Podium Voice services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Voice services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM VOICE IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Voice, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Voice emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Hardphone you or your End Users may use in connection with Voice services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Voice of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Voice for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Voice to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Hardphone Products that are used in accordance with these Voice Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE VOICE TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE HARDPHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A HARDPHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Hardphone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

9\. PHONE NUMBER PORTING.

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Voice, you must execute a letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Voice Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date; (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Voice Term of Service.

10\. EMERGENCY SERVICES.

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Voice is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Voice operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Voice, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Voice and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Voice Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Hardphone(s) & Desktop Softphone. When you use a Hardphone or the Desktop Softphone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Softphones) to make an emergency call, Voice relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Voice account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Voice account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Voice will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF VOICE FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Voice phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Voice Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Voice Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Voice Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Softphone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Softphone on your own device, the Voice application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Voice Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Voice will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Podium Voice services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Voice services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM VOICE IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Voice, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Voice emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Hardphone you or your End Users may use in connection with Voice services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Voice of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Voice for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Voice to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

8\. LIMITED HARDPHONE WARRANTY.

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Hardphone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Hardphone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Hardphone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Hardphone Product, replace the Hardphone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Hardphone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Hardphone Products that are used in accordance with these Voice Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Hardphone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Voice Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you.

As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

9\. PHONE NUMBER PORTING.

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Voice, you must execute a letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Voice Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date; (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Voice Term of Service.

10\. EMERGENCY SERVICES.

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Voice is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Voice operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Voice, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Voice and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Voice Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Hardphone(s) & Desktop Softphone. When you use a Hardphone or the Desktop Softphone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Softphones) to make an emergency call, Voice relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Voice account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Voice account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Voice will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF VOICE FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Voice phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Voice Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Voice Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Voice Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Softphone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Softphone on your own device, the Voice application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Voice Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Voice will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Podium Voice services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Voice services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM VOICE IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Voice, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Voice emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Hardphone you or your End Users may use in connection with Voice services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Voice of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Voice for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Voice to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE VOICE TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE HARDPHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A HARDPHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Hardphone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

9\. PHONE NUMBER PORTING.

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Voice, you must execute a letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Voice Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date; (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Voice Term of Service.

10\. EMERGENCY SERVICES.

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Voice is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Voice operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Voice, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Voice and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Voice Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Hardphone(s) & Desktop Softphone. When you use a Hardphone or the Desktop Softphone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Softphones) to make an emergency call, Voice relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Voice account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Voice account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Voice will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF VOICE FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Voice phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Voice Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Voice Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Voice Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Softphone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Softphone on your own device, the Voice application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Voice Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Voice will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Podium Voice services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Voice services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM VOICE IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Voice, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Voice emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Hardphone you or your End Users may use in connection with Voice services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Voice of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Voice for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Voice to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

You will also be required to: 1) purchase Voice Professional Installation; or (2) sign a waiver and work with your own IT provider to bring your network up to the minimum requirements, if your network passes the initial, pre-purchase test, but fails a second network quality test, which Podium will perform during the post-purchase onboarding process.

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Hardphone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Hardphone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Hardphone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Hardphone Product, replace the Hardphone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Hardphone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Hardphone Products that are used in accordance with these Voice Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Hardphone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE VOICE TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE HARDPHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A HARDPHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Hardphone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

9\. PHONE NUMBER PORTING.

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Voice, you must execute a letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Voice Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date; (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Voice Term of Service.

10\. EMERGENCY SERVICES.

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Voice is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Voice operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Voice, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Voice and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Voice Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Hardphone(s) & Desktop Softphone. When you use a Hardphone or the Desktop Softphone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Softphones) to make an emergency call, Voice relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Voice account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Voice account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Voice will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF VOICE FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Voice phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Voice Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Voice Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Voice Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Softphone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Softphone on your own device, the Voice application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Voice Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Voice will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Podium Voice services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Voice services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM VOICE IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Voice, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Voice emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Hardphone you or your End Users may use in connection with Voice services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Voice of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Voice for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Voice to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Hardphone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Hardphone Product, replace the Hardphone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Hardphone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Hardphone Products that are used in accordance with these Voice Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Hardphone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Voice Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Hardphone Products.

8.3. **THE VOICE SERVICES AND HARPHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE VOICE TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE HARDPHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM** [**TERMS OF SERVICE.**](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us) **ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A HARDPHONE PRODUCT.** Use of the Hardphone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

9\. PHONE NUMBER PORTING.

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Voice, you must execute a letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Voice Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date; (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Voice Term of Service.

10\. EMERGENCY SERVICES.

10.1. Overview of Emergency Services. Because Voice is a VoIP service the emergency calling services available through Voice operate differently from traditional emergency calling services and have certain limitations. If you are not comfortable with these limitations, you must utilize alternate means of accessing emergency services. By using Voice, you represent and warrant that you understand the limitations of emergency services available through Voice and you agree to comply with your obligations as set forth in these Voice Service Terms.

10.2. Emergency Calls using Hardphone(s) & Desktop Softphone. When you use a Hardphone or the Desktop Softphone (see Section 10.3 for information on Mobile Softphones) to make an emergency call, Voice relies on the information, including physical address, associated with your Voice account to route emergency calls to the nearest emergency responder(s). Accordingly, you are required to register a physical location address (“Registered Location”) when you activate your Voice account. If you change your location, you must immediately update your Registered Location, according to the process set forth below. If you have not updated your address to ensure its accuracy or if you are calling from an address other than your Registered Location, emergency services may be delayed. If no address is available, Voice will route the emergency call to a national emergency response center. When making an emergency call, it is also possible that, due to certain technical limitations, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. You should, therefore, immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. Do not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher.

10.2.1. Confirming and Updating your Registered Location. USE OF VOICE FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT (PSAP) OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE ACCURACY OF YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING SUCH INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIODICALLY CHECKING THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. You can verify that your Registered Location is correct via the following methods:

(a) By dialing 933 to be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Voice phone number you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number; or

(b) By visiting the “Voice Settings” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

Necessary updates to your information can be made in “Voice Settings.” Any changes you make to your Registered Location will take effect once you have saved them in “Voice Settings.”

10.3. Emergency Calling via Mobile Softphone. If you attempt to make an emergency call using the Mobile Softphone on your own device, the Voice application will close and will route that call to your device’s native dialer. If the device you are using does not have a native dialer (or the device does not have an active wireless cellular service), you will not be able to make the emergency call. Where possible you should make any emergency call directly using the native dialer on your device.

10.4. Additional Voice Limitations.

10.4.1. Emergency calling through Voice will not function if: (a) you experience an internet failure or power outage; (b) your broadband, ISP, or Podium Voice services are terminated or suspended; or (c) your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. Network congestion may also delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Voice services are provided.

10.4.2. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a Registered Location, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties.

10.5. Client Notice Obligations. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED USERS, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, OF PODIUM VOICE IS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Voice, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Voice emergency calls. If you receive any label or sticker from Podium relating to emergency services, you must attach that label or sticker where it is visible on any Hardphone you or your End Users may use in connection with Voice services.

10.6. Client Indemnity. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Voice of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency calling using Voice for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Voice to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

10.7. Disclaimer. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the Services to contact emergency services. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.

By using or accessing Podium’s Voice Service (“Voice”), or by signing or clicking accept to any Subscription Documentation that includes Voice or references these terms, you (“you” or “Client”) agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “**Voice Service Terms**”).

These Voice Service Terms incorporate by this reference the Podium Terms of Service (currently available at: [https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us](https://legal.podium.com/#termsofservice-us)) (the “Podium Terms of Service”) as may be updated from time to time, which, among other terms, contain provisions governing the resolution of claims (see Section 13 (“Disclaimers”), Section 14 (“Limitations of Liability”), Section 15 (“Dispute Resolution”), and Section 16 (“General”) of the Podium Terms of Service). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between these Voice Service Terms and the Podium Terms of Service, these Voice Service Terms will govern.

Capitalized terms used herein without a definition have the same meaning as the defined term in the Podium Terms of Service. All documents linked in these Voice Service Terms are deemed to those documents as updated from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to the “Agreement” will include these Voice Service Terms.

8\. LIMITED HARDPHONE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT.

8.1. Podium provides a one-year limited warranty against defective materials and faulty workmanship in a Hardphone Product. The warranty period starts on the date of your original purchase of the Hardphone Products from Podium and ends one year after that date. If you submit a claim during this warranty period that is within the scope of the limited warranty, follow Podium’s instructions for returning the Hardphone Product, and it appears that any product or part thereof contains a defect in materials or workmanship, Podium will at its option, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, either repair the Hardphone Product, replace the Hardphone Product, or refund to you all or part of the purchase price of the Hardphone Product. This limited warranty applies only to unaltered hardware components of the Hardphone Products that are used in accordance with these Voice Service Terms and not subject to accident, misuse, or neglect. Hardphone Products with the original factory serial number removed, defaced, or altered will not receive the original manufacturer’s warranty coverage.

8.2. This limited warranty is provided by Podium and not the Voice Service Provider. This limited warranty gives you specific rights and is personal to you. You may not transfer this warranty to any other person. You may have additional rights under applicable Law, and this limited warranty does not affect such rights. To make a warranty claim, please contact Podium. Podium will provide you with information about how to return your Hardphone Products.

8.3. THE VOICE SERVICES AND HARPHONE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE VOICE TERMS, PODIUM PROVIDES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, AND PODIUM DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE HARDPHONE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SUCH AS WARRANTIES REGARDING DATA LOSS, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, FUNCTIONALITY, AND LACK OF VIRUSES. THIS SECTION 8.3 APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN ADDITION TO ANY LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE PODIUM TERMS OF SERVICE. ANY WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED AS A MATTER OF LAW, BUT WHICH MAY BE LIMITED IN DURATION, LAST FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH YOU RECEIVE A HARDPHONE PRODUCT. Use of the Hardphone Products in conjunction with any other products, such as hardware accessories, may lead to incompatibilities which cause the Hardware Products to not function correctly. As a consequence, all such use is at your own risk.

9\. PHONE NUMBER PORTING.

9.1. If you request Podium to port your phone number to Voice, you must execute the letter of authorization provided to you by Podium, authorizing a Voice Service Provider to initiate the porting process. Podium assumes no responsibility for any lost communication during the porting process.

9.2. Podium, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse to allow you to port away any phone number ported into Podium, unless otherwise prohibited by Law. Podium may, at our sole discretion, allow you to port away phone numbers that you purchase from Podium and will allow you to port away phone numbers that you port to Podium, provided that you (a) have a Podium account in good standing; (b) have either ported in or purchased the phone number more than ninety (90) days prior to the port-away date; (c) provide all requested information including written notice to Podium of your intent to port the phone number(s) away from us before execution of the port-away request; and (d) are in compliance with these Voice Terms of Service.

10\. SECURITY.

10.1. Client is solely responsible for all use(s) related to your use of Voice. Client is responsible for complying and ensuring its Authorized Users comply, with all Laws applicable to Client’s use of Voice. Client is solely responsible and accepts full liability for all use of its Voice Service, with or without Client’s permission. Client will be solely responsible for any and all actions taken using its and its Authorized Users’ accounts, passwords, or access credentials. Client must notify Podium within twenty-four (24) hours of any breach of security or unauthorized use of its account. Use by all Authorized Users in aggregate will count towards any applicable Scope of Use restrictions. In the event that Podium discovers or has reason to believe the occurrence of unauthorized or prohibited usage of Voice, Podium reserves the right to take actions it deems reasonably necessary, without prior notice.

11\. EMERGENCY SERVICES

11.1. Voice provides Client with phone services over internet connection. Accordingly, there are important limitations to Voice. Voice access may differ depending on your location, internet connection, or the device you are using.

11.1.1. Voice has the ability to deliver your address, name, and phone number through a Voice Service Provider to the Public Safety Answering Point (“**PSAP**”). For technical reasons, the dispatcher may not receive your contact information. Therefore, you should immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency) and other contact information. You must not disconnect the emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher. If you are inadvertently disconnected, you must call back immediately.

11.1.2. USE OF VOICE FROM A LOCATION OTHER THAN YOUR REGISTERED LOCATION MAY CAUSE YOUR EMERGENCY CALL TO BE ROUTED TO THE WRONG PSAP OR CAUSE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTACT INFORMATION ACCURACY BY PROVIDING, MAINTAINING, AND UPDATING CORRECT CONTACT INFORMATION FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. CLIENT MAINTAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PERIODICALLY CHECK THAT COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED FOR EMERGENCY CALLING. There are two methods by which you can verify your contact information as correct:

11.1.2.1. By dialing 933. You will then be connected to an automated system that will read back the Podium Voice phone number that you are calling from, along with the address associated with that number.

11.1.2.2. By visiting the “Location Setup” page of the Podium portal and viewing your contact information on record.

11.1.3. Voice emergency calling will not function (i) in the event of an internet or power outage; (ii) if your broadband, ISP, or Podium Voice is terminated or suspended; or (iii) if your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly. It is possible that network congestion may delay or prevent completion of any emergency call. You will not be able to complete an emergency call if you move to a physical location outside the country in which your Voice line is provided.

11.1.4. If you are not comfortable with the limitations of Voice emergency calls, you should utilize alternate means for accessing emergency services.

11.1.5. YOUR USE, AND USE BY YOUR EMPLOYEES, GUESTS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND AUTHORIZED USERS, OF PODIUM VOICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. You are responsible for notifying any user or potential users of Voice, including but not limited to your Authorized Users, of the limitations of Voice emergency calls. The availability of certain features, such as transmission of a registered address or your Podium Voice number, depends on whether local emergency response centers support those features, and other factors outside of Podium’s control. Podium relies on qualified third parties to assist us in routing emergency calls and text messages to emergency response centers. Podium does not have control over emergency response centers, emergency responders, or other third parties. Podium disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of emergency response centers, third parties engaged by Client to facilitate address updates, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services.

11.1.6. Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium Entities, as well as any third-party provider(s), from and against any and all third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (i) Client’s incorrect information; (ii) Client’s failure to properly notify any person who may place calls using Voice of the emergency calling limitations; or (iii) the absence, failure, or outage of emergency service calling using Voice for any reason; and (iv) the inability of any user of Voice to be able to access emergency service personnel for any reason.

11.1.7. Neither Podium nor its representatives will be liable under any legal or equitable theory for any claim, damage, or loss (and Client will hold Podium harmless against any and all such claims) arising from or relating to the inability to use the services to contact emergency services. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you hereby release, discharge, and hold harmless Podium from and against any and all liability relating to or arising from any acts or omissions of such third parties or other third parties involved in the handling of or response to any emergency or emergency call.
