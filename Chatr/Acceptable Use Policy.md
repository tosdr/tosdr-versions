**Security**

As set out above, you are responsible for any misuse of the Services, by your or by any other person with access to the Services through your Equipment or your account. Therefore, you must take steps to ensure that others do not gain unauthorized access to the Services through any means, including, without limitation, wireless networking. The Services may not be used to breach the security of another user or to attempt to gain access to any other person's equipment, software or data, without the knowledge and consent of such person. Additionally, the Services may not be used in any attempt to circumvent the user authentication or security of any host, network, or account, including, without limitation, accessing data not intended for you, logging into or making use of a server or account you are not expressly authorized to access, or probing the security of other networks. Use or distribution of tools designed for compromising security, such as password guessing programs, cracking tools, packet sniffers or network probing tools, is prohibited. You may not disrupt the Services. The Services also may not be used to interfere with computer networking or telecommunications services to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, denial of service attacks, flooding of a network, overloading a service, improper seizing and abuse of operator privileges and attempts to "crash" a host. The transmission or dissemination of any information or software that contains a virus or other harmful feature is also prohibited. You are solely responsible for the security of any device you choose to connect to the Services, including any data stored on that device. In particular, chatr recommends against enabling file or printer sharing of any sort. chatr recommends that any files or services you do choose to make available for remote access be protected with a strong password or as otherwise appropriate. You agree to treat as confidential all access codes, personal identification numbers and/or other passwords that we may provide to you for use with the Services.

**Unsolicited Communications**

As set out above, the Services may not be used to send unsolicited, bulk or commercial messages or for any other unsolicited communications. This includes, without limitation, using automatic-dialing and announcing devices to or otherwise make unsolicited voice or facsimile calls and bulk mailing of commercial advertising, informational announcements, charity requests, petitions for signatures and political or religious messages. Such communications may only be directed to those who have explicitly requested it. The Services may not be used to send messages to any individual who has indicated that he/she does not wish to receive messages from you. The Services may not be used to collect responses from unsolicited e-mail messages sent from accounts on Internet hosts or e-mail services that violate this AUP or the acceptable use policy of any other service provider. Moreover, unsolicited e-mail messages may not direct the recipient to any web site or other resource that uses the Services. Forging, altering or removing e-mail headers is prohibited. You may not reference any chatr network (for example, by including "Organization: chatr" in the header) in any unsolicited e-mail even if that e-mail is not sent through a chatr network. "Mail bombing" is prohibited. That is, you may not send numerous copies of the same or substantially similar messages, nor may you send very large messages or files to a recipient with the intent to disrupt a server or account. The propagation of chain letters is similarly prohibited, whether or not the recipient wishes to receive such mailings. chatr is not responsible for the forwarding of e-mail sent to any account that has been suspended or terminated. Such e-mail will be returned to sender, ignored, deleted, or stored temporarily, at chatr's sole discretion.

**User-Generated Content Services**

**"User-Generated Content Services"** or **"UGC Services"** refers to any services that allow an end user to post, upload or generate content online to be shared with a limited or unlimited number of recipients and may include, without limitation: newsgroups, online forums, message boards, chat programs, wiki's, photo sharing services, customer review sites, video sharing services, blogs and web hosting.

Any User-Generated Content Services accessed through the Services, must be used in accordance with the following:

vii. you must not use the UGC Service to perform "flooding", which refers to deliberately repeating actions in quick succession in order to fill the screens of other users with text or other content;

viii. any device connected through the Services may not maintain more than two simultaneous chat connections including, without limitation, the use of automated programs, such as "bots" or "clones". Automated programs may not be used when the account holder is not physically present at the device;

x. you must not forge, alter or obscure your identity (other than using a nickname) while participating in the UGC Service.

**Usage, Data Storage and Other Limitations**

You must comply with the then current usage, data storage and other limitations on your applicable Services. You must also ensure that your activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, or degrade any other subscriber's use of the Services, nor represent (in the sole judgment of chatr) an unusually large burden on our networks. In addition, you must ensure that your activity does not improperly restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade or impede chatr's ability to deliver the Services, and monitor and investigate the Services, backbone, network nodes, and/or other network services or components. You may not resell, share, or otherwise distribute the Services or any portion thereof to any third party without the written consent of chatr. The Services are consumer products designed for personal purposes. For example, the Services do not provide the type of security, upstream performance and total downstream throughput capability typically associated with commercial use. You may not run a server in connection with the Services. You may not provide network services to others via the Services. In addition, you are prohibited from running servers for mail, http, ftp, irc, and dhcp, and multi-user interactive forums.

Your use of the Services may be subject to a usage limit, as set out in your Agreement. If you exceed that limit, you may be subject to additional usage charges.

**Network Management**

We reserve the right to manage our networks in order to optimize their efficiency for the benefit of our subscribers, including, without limitation, by way of the following: rate limiting (speed), rejection or removal of spam or otherwise unsolicited bulk e-mail, anti-virus mechanisms, and protocol filtering. We may take any other action we deem appropriate in order to help ensure the integrity of the network experience for all subscribers.

**Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy**

As set out in the Terms, we have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor or investigate any content that is transmitted using the Services (other than voice Services) or the Equipment; and to access or preserve content or information in accordance with the Terms. We prefer to advise subscribers of inappropriate behavior and any necessary corrective action. However, if the Services are used in a way that we, in our sole discretion, believe violates this AUP, any of the chatr Parties may take any responsive actions they deem appropriate. Such actions may include, without limitation, temporary or permanent removal of content, cancellation of newsgroup posts, filtering of Internet transmissions, and/or the immediate suspension or termination of all or any portion of the Services or your account. The chatr Parties will have no liability for any such responsive actions. The above described actions are not exclusive remedies and the chatr Parties may take any other legal or technical action deemed appropriate. Upon termination of an account, any of the chatr Parties are authorized to delete any files, programs, data and e-mail messages associated with such account. The failure to enforce this AUP, for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any time. If any portion of this AUP is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. This AUP shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with the governing law provision set out in the Terms.
