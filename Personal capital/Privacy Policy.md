Empower Personal Dashboard Privacy Policy




===============================================

This Empower Personal DashboardTM Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes the specific policies and procedures we use to collect, utilize, disclose, share, and protect your Personal Information in your use of the Empower Dashboard. Empower Personal Wealth, LLC (“Empower”, “we”, “us,” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Empower Annuity Insurance Company of America. Together with our **[Terms of Use](https://www.empower.com/hpc/terms-of-use)**, this Privacy Policy governs your use of the Empower Personal Dashboard. Please note that this Privacy Policy pertains only to your use of the Empower Dashboard; Empower maintains a separate policy applicable to its other services and products that may be viewed at [Empower Privacy Policy](https://www.empower.com/privacy).

Empower is committed to the protection of our Visitors, Users, Cash Customers, and Advisory Clients (also referred to as “you” or “your”) privacy. We understand that keeping your information secure and confidential is critical to earning and keeping your trust. 

**How to Use this Empower Personal Dashboard Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Empower Personal Dashboard and describes how we collect and use your Personal Information and how we address other privacy matters, such as deletion of your Personal Information upon request and opting out of marketing communications. We also describe methods for contacting Empower if you have privacy questions, comments, or feedback.

The information that we collect, and how we use it, depends on your relationship with us and may change as your relationship evolves with us. This Privacy Policy is organized based on those different types of relationships – Visitors, Users, Cash Customers, and Advisory Clients.

You may fall into more than one category concurrently depending on your relationship with us. For example, a Cash Customer may also be a Visitor before they log into their dashboard, wherein they will also be a User.

**How We Collect and Use Your Information**

**“Personal Information”** means your personally identifiable information such as your name, email or mailing address, phone number, account credentials (User id and passwords), Social Security number, government ID numbers and other information that can be used to identify you personally.

We also collect and use other information that we obtain from your activities using our services. This includes information that you do not explicitly provide to us, but which may be implicitly provided to us as part of such activities. More information on this is provided below under the Visitors use case.

We also collect your preferences when you elect to receive or opt-out of cookies, communications involving email, texting, or telephone calls; these preferences apply to Empower communications with you and are not shared with nor transferable to third parties.

| --- | --- |
| **Sharing Category** | **What do we share and why?** |
| Our service providers | Like most businesses, we use third-party service providers to deliver some of the services mentioned in this Privacy Policy. In doing so, we provide some of your data (including your personal information) to those third-party service providers, on a need-to-know basis. Our contracts with those service providers require them to safeguard your information and prohibit them from using your data for any purpose other than to provide services to us or to improve their services. |

**Anonymized Information**

We may use anonymized information that is summarized or derived from information that you provide to us for research, benchmarking, and publication. Anonymized information is information that does not include any personally identifiable information and therefore is outside of the terms of this Policy.

_Additional Privacy Information and Your Privacy Rights and Resources_

**Affiliate Use**

We may share personal information among our affiliated companies for their everyday business purposes to provide services that you have requested. We do not share your personal information with affiliates for their marketing purposes. From time to time, we may make you aware of products and services that are available from our affiliates.  For a list of the Empower Family of Companies, please see the Privacy Notice at the end of this document.

**Our Use of Google Analytics**

We use Google Analytics to help us understand how you interact with our website and mobile app, to market our products and services to you, and to improve the User experience. To do this, we share a unique identifier with Google. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, see “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On, [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

**Our Use of Tags, Pixels, Cookies, and Other Trackers**

Tags, pixels, and cookies are bits of code that we use to gather information to operate and measure engagement with our site. These generally fall into two categories:

* **User experience** – Information that helps us determine which features are most popular with our users, provide content and offers that are relevant to a user’s financial situation or site engagement, market our products and services to you, and identify errors or other technical issues on our site.
* **Marketing attribution** – Information that allows us to track the effectiveness of advertising we run on other sites and manage our affiliate marketing program, as well as to optimize marketing of our services and products. For example, marketing pixels operate by sending a small amount of information when triggered by specific events, such as when a user registers on our site after clicking through a promotional link on another site. To do this, the pixel uses a unique identifier that does not contain personally identifying information to connect that data (user registration) back to the action (clicking on the link).

Empower and third- party service providers we hire may use such cookies and web beacons (collectively referred to below as “cookies” to track the online movements of users of our websites and mobile applications, and to collect other data such as IP address, type of device used, and browser information. Empower and its third-party service providers use such data to customize your experience on our website and personalize our communications with you. With respect to emails that are sent to you, we or our service providers also use cookies and web beacons to determine when you receive and open our emails, whether you click any links in the email, and other information about the device from which you access the email, as permitted by law.

If you do not want to have cookies on your computer or device, you can use the banner or the link at the bottom of the webpage to that is titled “Do not sell or share my personal information” to settings or tools offered on your browser to access a cookie manager in which you may refuse or deny certain types of cookies. Additionally, you can use the settings or tools offered on your browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. If you refuse or delete cookies, you may notice an impact on your use of Empower’s (and its affiliates’) websites; for example, you may not be able to sign in and access your account without additional authentication, or we may not be able to recognize you, your device or your online preferences.. Some of our service providers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, an AdTech self-regulatory organization. You may learn more about the Network Advertising Initiative and the opt-out of interest-based advertising that they offer by visiting [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and following the opt-out instructions therein.

You can consult our [support article](https://support-personalwealth.empower.com/hc/en-us/articles/201169930-Cancel-or-Delete-Your-Empower-Personal-Dashboard-Account)  for instructions on how to do so. We will retain information on deleted accounts as required for legal, regulatory, and security purposes. If you use other services from Empower or its affiliates, deleting your Empower Dashboard account will not terminate or delete your account with respect to those other services.

Under the CCPA, California residents have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing (as such terms are defined under the CCPA) of their personal information. While we do not share your personal information to third parties for monetary gain, the CCPA has a broader definition of “sale” and “share” that may be applicable to use of certain third-party cookies, tags, pixels or web beacons (collectively, “cookies”) on our websites or mobile applications. In this context, Empower and our advertising partners use cookies and the advertising identifier associated with your mobile or internet-connected device.

If you wish to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information pertaining to Empower’s use of third-party cookies as described above, you may do so by clicking on the “Do not sell or share my personal information” link at the bottom of this web page, or if you are using a mobile app, by opting out in the Privacy Preference Center under the “Settings” section of your Profile.  In the future if you change browsers, devices, or clear your cookies, you will need to opt-out again as described above.

As described in our Privacy Policy, we may, from time to time, use anonymized or deidentified data to perform analysis on personal finance and related topics. Such findings may be shared with external publishers or published by us. We also authorize some of our service providers to use anonymized or deidentified information to provide services to us or improve their services generally.

**Explanation of Your Rights**

**Right to know what personal information is being collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose**

Subject to applicable exemptions in the CCPA, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, to the extent required by the CCPA, we will disclose to you:

* The categories of personal information we collected about you
* The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected
* The business or commercial purpose for which we collected or sold the personal information
* The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information
* The categories of personal information that we sold and, for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we sold the particular category of personal information
* The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose and, for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed that particular category of personal information, and
* The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you

**Right to request deletion**

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will deidentify or delete (and direct our service providers to delete from their records) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

**Right to correct inaccurate personal information**

You have the right to request correction of your personal information that is inaccurate. Once we receive your verifiable consumer request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate personal information as described in your request. You may be required to provide additional documentation if necessary to determine the accuracy of your personal information.

**How Can I Exercise My Right to Opt Out of the Sale or Sharing of My Personal Information?**

Under the CCPA, California residents have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing (as such terms are defined under the CCPA) of their personal information. While we do not share your personal information to third parties for monetary gain, the CCPA has a broader definition of “sale” and “share” that may be applicable to use of certain third-party cookies, tags, pixels or web beacons (collectively, “cookies”) on our websites or mobile applications. In this context, Empower and our advertising partners use cookies and the advertising identifier associated with your mobile or internet-connected device.

If you wish to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information pertaining to Empower’s use of third-party cookies as described above, you may do so by clicking on the “Do not sell or share my personal information” link at the bottom of this web page, or if you are using a mobile app, by opting out in the Privacy Preference Center under the “Settings” section of your Profile.  In the future if you change browsers, devices, or clear your cookies, you will need to opt-out again as described above. Please note that Empower will continue to share your data with service providers as permitted by law and described in the section entitled “Categories of Third Parties with Whom We Disclose Personal Information ” above. 

**How Can I Exercise My Right to Limit the Use of my Sensitive Personal Information?**

We limit the collection, use, and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to that which is necessary to provide our services to you or for another permitted purpose under the CCPA, such as detecting security incidents, and we do not use this information to infer characteristics about you. Our service providers are contractually obligated to limit their use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to that which is necessary for the business purpose set forth in our contract with them.   Since we already limit the use of your sensitive personal information, an opt-out is not necessary.

**How Can I Exercise My Rights Under the CCPA?**

If you have an Empower Dashboard account:

* Log in to your account and go to Settings. Under the Privacy section, you will be able to request a report of the categories of information or specific information that we have collected about you or request that we delete your personal information.
* To correct any inaccurate personal information, please log on to your Empower dashboard account to manually update the applicable field for your Profile under “Settings” and/or contact [support@personalwealth.empower.com](mailto:support@personalwealth.empower.com); additionally, if you are a Client, you can also contact your financial advisor. In most cases, we will be able to authenticate your request using your dashboard login. In certain circumstances, if we believe it is necessary to authenticate your request and protect the security of your information, we may require additional information.

If you do not have an Empower Dashboard account:

* Fill out a [Privacy Request Form](https://docs.empower.com/empower/privacy/Privacy-Request-Form.pdf). 
* You will need to provide your full name, phone number, and email so that we can authenticate your request and locate your personal information If you previously had an Empower Dashboard account, please provide the email and phone number you used to log in to your dashboard.
* We will authenticate your request by matching the information you provide against any information that we have collected about you. However, in some cases, we may not have collected sufficient information about you to authenticate your request. In certain circumstances, if we believe it is necessary to authenticate your request and protect the security of your information, we may require additional information.
* Empower may deny your request in the event compliance with a request is not required due to applicable exemptions.

You may also exercise your CCPA rights by calling us toll-free at **855-756-4738**.

**How Can I Designate an Authorized Agent to Exercise My Rights Under the CCPA?**

You may use an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf. To do so, the authorized agent must provide a copy of your signed authorization to [privacymatters@empower.com](mailto:privacymatters@empower.com). You will also be required to verify your identity directly with us and confirm that you have provided the authorized agent with your permission to submit a request on your behalf.

**Nondiscrimination & Nonretaliation**

We will not discriminate or retaliate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. To the extent prohibited by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services, or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior consent, which you may revoke at any time.
