Privacy Notice
==============

  
Effective January 1st 2010  
  
OpenWiFiSpots is an online application that helps people find free wifi hotspots. To accomplish this, people write comments and reviews about locations that are posted to OpenWiFiSpots. These comments and reviews can then be accessed and read by anyone visiting this site. For the purposes of this Privacy notice, a "user" is defined as someone using the OpenWiFiSpots Site.  
  
By using OpenWiFiSpots, you permit the collection and use of your personal information, although extremely limited in nature as outlined below in our Privacy notice. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy notice.  
  
**Information We Collect**  
In order for OpenWiFiSpots to work properly we log your browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp.  
  
**How We Use Your Information**  
Information such as your full name and any personally identifiable information you have included in your comments and reviews may be shown to other users in conjunction with comments and reviews you have contributed.  
  
Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer OpenWiFiSpots, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising links.  
  
**Transfer of Information**  
We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information. OpenWiFiSpots will disclose information about individual users to governmental or judicial authorities or law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. Further, OpenWiFiSpots may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of this Privacy notice.  
  
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of OpenWiFiSpots, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, OpenWiFiSpots will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy notice.  
  
OpenWiFiSpots will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing.  
  
**Links**  
Our Website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation. OpenWiFiSpots does not share your personal information with those Websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy polices on these third party Websites.  
  
**Use of Cookies**  
Like most Websites, OpenWiFiSpots requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience. You should be aware that OpenWiFiSpots cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or any information advertisers may gather from their use of cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features available on the OpenWiFiSpots site.  
  
**Controlling Your Personal Information**  
You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via comments and reviews, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the OpenWiFiSpots site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of OpenWiFiSpots. Please do not post any personal information on the OpenWiFiSpots site or in other areas that you expect to keep private.  
  
**Third-Party Advertising**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here.](https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=94149)  
  
**Security**  
OpenWiFiSpots tries very hard to protect our users' information. We use industry standard measures to protect your information that is stored within our database. We limit the access to your information to those employees who need access to perform their job function. If you have any questions about the security at our Website, please contact us. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy notice.  
  
You hereby acknowledge that OpenWiFiSpots is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.  
  
**Children**  
This Website is not directed to children, and OpenWiFiSpots does not knowingly solicit information from any child under the age of 13. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or guardian) to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.  
  
**Terms and Modifications to this Privacy Statement**  
By using the Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our Privacy notice. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the site. OpenWiFiSpots may modify this Privacy notice at any time. If a material change is made to this Privacy notice and/or the way we use our users’ personally identifiable information, then we will post a prominent notice of the nature of such change on the first page of this Privacy notice and also on our home page. You are responsible for reviewing this Privacy notice periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it. Your continued use of the site indicates your assent to any changes to this Privacy notice.
