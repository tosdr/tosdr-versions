OpenWiFiSpots cannot guarantee, represent, or warrant that the content contained in these sites is accurate, legal, and/or inoffensive. OpenWiFiSpots does not endorse the content of any third-party site, nor do we warrant that it will not contain viruses or otherwise impact your computer.

Business listings located on OpenWiFiSpots are selected for display in search results based primarily on their content in relation to the user-provided search terms. Consequently, both customer and non-customer listings will be included in a search results list, and OpenWiFiSpots will not discriminate based on whether a business is a customer with regard to placement or inclusion in the business listings. OpenWiFiSpots customers do not pay to be included in certain search result listings or to retain a specific ranking unless they are specifically participating in various advertising programs wich are labeled as such.  
  
OpenWiFiSpots customer listings may be rotated within the search results due to a number of factors, none of which are determined by paid inclusion or paid placement. Thus, such variable placement of OpenWiFiSpots customers is not intended to displace non-customer search results placement or inclusion. Indeed, non-customers with a good deal of quality content could appear higher on search result returns than OpenWiFiSpots customers.
