FURTHERMORE, BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT ANY AND ALL  INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US THROUGH THE SERVICES IS TRUE, ACCURATE AND COMPLETE. THE PROVISION OF  FALSE OR FRAUDULENT INFORMATION IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

AS USED HEREIN, THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS SHALL APPLY:

“**AGREEMENT**” OR “**TERMS**” MEANS THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND LINKS REFERRED TO  HEREIN.

**1\. SERVICES**

Yotpo’s unified platform is a unique, proprietary customer retention platform (“**Platform**”) that offers a single-platform approach connecting data and experiences with solutions for Reviews and Visual UGC, Loyalty & Referrals, SMS Marketing, Email Marketing and Subscriptions to maximize customer retention (each also referred to as a “**Product**” and, as may be combined, “**Products**”). “**Services**,” as used in this  Agreement, refers to a Client’s access to the Platform, Products and other ancillary services specified in  the Order. All content, data and other information that Client (i) submits to the Services or (ii) generates through its use  of the Services, including, without limitation, such information as Client may collect through the Services from  End-Users (as defined below), is “**Client Content**” for the purposes of this Agreement. Depending on the  Products licensed by Client, Client may have access to the following functionality. If the Client has not  received access to a specific Product that offers the following functionality, then the terms for that  function shall not apply:

a. User Generated Content– Certain Products enable Client to collect, organize and use Client  Content that may include, without limitation, text, videos, photographs and other user generated content created or otherwise supplied by the Client’s customers, end-users or parties  with whom Client interacts (each an “**End-User**” and, collectively, “**End-Users**”) on the Client’s  website, social media services, and third-party websites. An example of such functionality would  be the Client’s use of the Platform to display an End-User’s photo of the Client’s product on the  Client’s website.

b. Loyalty and Referrals– Certain Products enable Client to provide End-Users with the ability to (i)  earn loyalty points from Client and apply applicable point balances to purchases from Client and  (ii) earn an incentive when the End-User refers a third-party purchaser to Client (“**Loyalty and  Referrals**”). Client Content in the context of loyalty and referrals includes information related to  an End-User’s participation in a loyalty or referral program (for example, the number of the End User’s loyalty points).

c. Reviews– Certain Products enable Client to invite End-Users to write Reviews (as defined below).  “Reviews” are Client Content that may include, without limitation, opinions, product or service  ratings or reviews, articles, written expressions, in any form or media, and/or any works of  authorship created by the End-User, the Client or any other third party and may, subject to this  Agreement, include any reviews that are imported through the Platform from third-party sites.

d. SMS Marketing – Certain Products enable Client to engage with End-Users by utilizing  SMS/MMS/text messages. Through an application provided by Yotpo, or through the Platform, a  Client can enable features whereby Client can send marketing and other messages via  SMS/MMS/text message regarding the Client’s products or services.

e. Email Marketing – Certain products enable Client to engage with End-users by sending emails. Through an application provided by Yotpo, a Client can enable features whereby Client can send marketing or transactional outreach via email regarding the Client’s products or services.

f. Subscriptions – Certain Products enable Client to offer Subscriptions options on their sites. “Subscriptions” are recurring purchase options offered to provide End-Users the convenience of receiving automated shipments and charges for products they choose. An example of such functionality would be the Client’s use of the Platform to display subscriptions offering on the Client’s product(s).

g. Ocean – A subscription shopping membership that allows customers to connect with their favorite brands and retailers and receive exciting benefits in exchange for shopping with them. If you participate in Ocean, your participation in and use of Ocean are subject to the additional terms currently available at [https://www.yotpo.com/ocean-terms-and-conditions/](https://www.yotpo.com/ocean-terms-and-conditions/), which are then incorporated by reference to these Terms.

Yotpo shall not be liable for any Client Content, and shall be entitled, in its sole  discretion, to edit or remove from the Platform any Client Content which Yotpo reasonably  believes to be inaccurate, inappropriate or otherwise not in compliance with the Agreement or  applicable law. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OBLIGATES YOTPO TO DISPLAY ANY CLIENT  CONTENT THAT YOTPO REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE INACCURATE, INAPPROPRIATE OR  OTHERWISE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR APPLICABLE LAW OR TO USE SUCH  CLIENT CONTENT AT ALL OR IN A CERTAIN MANNER. Client shall designate a copyright agent and  implement a notice and takedown mechanism in compliance with the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act (or other comparable applicable laws in jurisdictions outside of the United States),  and Client shall comply with any such takedown notice received in respect of any Client Content,  in each case, to the extent required by applicable law.

f. Rights in Client Content– Client represents and warrants to Yotpo that Client has given all notices  and obtained all rights consents, assignments, licenses, permissions and authorizations (including  the waiver of any moral rights) necessary for Client to transfer to Yotpo and for Yotpo to collect,  use and share the Client Content (and any Personal Information contained therein) as  contemplated by this Agreement without violation or infringement of (i) any Laws, (ii) intellectual  property, publicity, privacy or other rights, or (iii) any terms of service or other agreements  governing the Client Content or Client’s activities relating to its use of the Services (including,  without limitation, the Instagram Platform Policy).

g. Permitted Users and End-Users– Client shall ensure that each of Client’s Permitted Users and  End-Users is legally bound by Client’s terms of use, terms of service or such other legally binding  agreement between Client and each such End-User in a manner that prohibits End-Users from  infringing or otherwise violating third-party rights including, without limitation, third-party  intellectual property rights.

h. Order Fulfillment– As between Client and Yotpo, Client is solely responsible for all customer  service, order fulfillment and returns, and payment of taxes or charges associated with any  products or services that Client sells or markets in connection with the domains listed on the  Order.

i. Sending Messages to End-Users via the Services– To the extent that Yotpo provides Client with  access to functionality that allows Client to send Client communications by telephone,  text/SMS/MMS message or email to End-Users, including, without limitation, marketing and  advertising communications (“**Client Messages**”), Client agrees not to send any unsolicited,  commercial communications. Further, Client acknowledges that Client is solely responsible for all  content of Client Messages created by or on behalf of Client and for Client’s compliance with all  Laws in connection with Client’s use of the Services to send Client Messages. Accordingly, and  notwithstanding any representation or warranty disclaimer in the Agreement, Client represents,  warrants and covenants that: (i) all applicable lists of email addresses and/or phone numbers  were created and/or shared with Yotpo in a manner that complies with Laws, (ii) each End-User  or other recipient of Client Messages or other communications has been given clear and  conspicuous notice prior to the collection of his or her phone number, email address and/or  other contact information that such information may be collected, used or shared to facilitate  sending Client Messages to such recipient and as contemplated in this Agreement and (iii) each  End-User or other recipient of applicable communications has given all consents required by Law  to receiving commercial email and other forms of communication, including, but not limited to,  consent to receive the Client Messages.

j. Limits on Certain Messages– By using functionality to send Client Messages to End-Users, Client  agrees to make End-Users aware of their right to opt out of any future messages, as required by  law. Client is responsible for honoring all opt-out requests from End-Users. Client must use a  valid telephone number. Phone numbers such as landline numbers that cannot receive  SMS/MMS or text messages will not be eligible for the Services. Client agrees that Yotpo reserves  the right in its sole discretion to cap the number of Client Messages that may be sent in  connection with the Services. Applicable message and data rates apply to such messages. Client  hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) Yotpo merely plays a technical role in transmitting or  routing Client Messages sent by Client as a conduit, (ii) that Client is the sender of any Client  Messages for purposes of Laws, (iii) Yotpo has no relationship with or any obligation to any End User or any other person or entity with to whom Client provides services utilizing the Services  (“End-User Services”), none of whom is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and (iv)  Client shall have sole responsibility and liability for any Client Messages and for compliance with  any Laws related to End-User Services. Yotpo may suspend or disable Client’s ability to send  messages through the Services at any time if Yotpo, in its sole discretion, believes Client is  sending messages in violation of the Terms of this Agreement.

**6\. SUSPENSION OF SERVICE**

Yotpo may suspend Client’s access to the Services if Client breaches Section 4 (Limitations on  Use) or Section 5 (Client Obligations), if Client’s account is 30 days or more overdue or if Client’s  actions risk harm to other Clients or the security, availability or integrity of the Services. Where  practicable, Yotpo will use reasonable efforts to provide Client with prior notice of the  suspension. Once Client resolves the issue requiring suspension, Yotpo will promptly restore  Client’s access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement. Yotpo reserves the right, but is  not obligated, to monitor and audit Client’s use of the Services for any reason or no reason,  without notice, to ensure Client’s compliance with this Agreement.

b. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS  MAY NOT APPLY WHERE SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE INAPPLICABLE.

c. YOU RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY  LIMITATIONS IN THESE TERMS ARE A MATERIAL, BARGAINED-FOR BASIS OF THESE TERMS AND  THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN THE DECISION BY YOTPO TO  OFFER TO YOU AND BY YOU TO USE THE SERVICES AND THE PLATFORM.

**12\. INDEMNIFICATION**

a. Indemnification by Yotpo– Yotpo will defend Client, its officers, directors, employees and  affiliates (“Client Indemnified Parties”) from and against any third-party claim made against a  Client Indemnified Party to the extent alleging that the Platform or the Services, when used by  Client as authorized in this Agreement, infringes such third-party’s U.S. patent, copyright,  trademark or trade secret, and will indemnify and hold harmless Client Indemnified Parties  against any damages or costs awarded against Client (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or  agreed in settlement by Yotpo resulting from the claim.

b. Indemnification by Client– Client will defend Yotpo, its officers, directors, employees, and  affiliates (“Yotpo Indemnified Parties”) from and against any third-party claim, demand, suit, or  proceeding made or brought against a Yotpo Indemnified Party to the extent resulting from  Client Content, or Client’s breach or alleged breach of Section 5 (Client’s Obligations), Client’s use  of the Services or any activities other than in accordance with these Terms; and will indemnify  and hold harmless Yotpo Indemnified Parties against any damages or costs awarded against  Yotpo Indemnified Parties (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in settlement by  Client resulting from the claim.

c. Procedures– The indemnifying party’s obligations in this Section 12 are subject to receiving (i)  prompt written notice of the claim, (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation,  defense and settlement of the claim and (iii) all reasonably necessary cooperation of the  indemnified party, at the indemnifying party’s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs. The  indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the indemnified party’s prior written  consent if settlement would require the indemnified party to admit fault or take or refrain from  taking any action (other than relating to use of the Service, when Yotpo is the indemnifying  party). The indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

d. Mitigation and Exceptions– In response to an actual or potential infringement claim, if required  by settlement or injunction or as Yotpo determines necessary to avoid material liability, Yotpo  may at its option: (i) procure rights for Client’s continued use of the Platform or the Services, (ii)  replace or modify the allegedly infringing portion of the Platform or the Services to avoid  infringement without reducing the Platform’s or the Services’ overall functionality or (iii)  terminate the affected Order and refund to Client any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated  portion of the subscription Term. Yotpo’s obligations in this Section 12 do not apply (1) to infringement resulting from Client’s modification of the Platform or the Services or use of the  Platform in combination with items not provided by Yotpo (including third-party platforms), (2)  to infringement resulting from Services other than the most recent release, (3) to unauthorized  use of the Platform or the Services, or (4) if Client settles or makes any admissions about a claim  without Yotpo’s prior written consent. This Section 12 sets out Client’s exclusive remedy and  Yotpo’s entire liability regarding infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.

**13\. THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS AND CONTENT**

a. Client may choose to use the Services with certain platform(s), publisher(s), add-on, website(s),  service or product not provided by Yotpo that Client elects to integrate or enable for use with the  Services (“T**hird-Party Platforms**“). Third-Party Platforms are not responsible for the Services or  the obligations between Yotpo and Client pursuant to these Terms. Use of Third-Party Platforms  is subject to Client’s agreement with the relevant provider and not this Agreement, except where  expressly agreed by a Third-Party Platform, Third-Party Platform cannot provide assistance with  the installation or use of the Services. Yotpo does not control and has no liability for Third-Party  Platforms, including their security, functionality, operation, availability or interoperability or how  the Third-Party Platforms or their providers use any and all data including (without limitation)  End-User data. If Client enables a Third-Party Platform to integrate or otherwise operate in  connection with the Services, Client authorizes Yotpo to (i) access and exchange Client Content  and End-User data (including personally identifiable information) with the network  on Client’s behalf and (ii) if required by the applicable Third-Party Platform, retain Client Content  and/or End-User data for such time period and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the  applicable Third-Party Platform, subject in each case to Yotpo’s obligations under the Data  Processing Addendum.

b. If Client is redirected to linked sites and content in connection with Client’s use of any Third-Party  Platform, Yotpo recommends Client carefully read and abide by the terms of use and privacy  policies of such sites and content. Any opinions, advice, statements, content, services, offers or  other information expressed or made available by any Third-Party Platform, are those of the  respective third-party author(s) or distributor(s) and do not necessarily state or reflect those of  Yotpo.

**14\. TERM, TERMINATION, AND PAYMENT OF FEES**

a. This Agreement is effective between Client and Yotpo as of the date of Client’s accepting this  Agreement. The initial term of your subscription to the Services is as specified on your Order. THEREAFTER, THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SHORTER OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM OR ONE (1) YEAR (EACH, A “RENEWAL TERM”) UNLESS A PARTY NOTIFIES THE OTHER PARTY IN WRITING AT LEAST THIRTY (30) DAYS IN  ADVANCE OF THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT TERM THAT IT DOES NOT WISH TO  RENEW THIS AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, FOR ANY RENEWAL  TERM, YOTPO RESERVES THE RIGHT UPON WRITTEN NOTICE TO CLIENT AT LEAST  THIRTY (30) DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT TERM TO INCREASE  THE PRICING IN EFFECT DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDING ONE-YEAR PERIOD. For free services, the subscription term shall commence upon your creation of an account to access the free services and shall remain in effect until terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, Yotpo may terminate your free subscription and discontinue the free services at any time for any reason at its sole discretion.

b. Either Yotpo or Client may terminate this Agreement if: (i) the other Party is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice; or (ii) the other Party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings  and the proceedings are not dismissed within ninety (90) days.

c. In any event of termination of this Agreement by either Party, all rights granted hereunder shall immediately expire and any and all use and/or exploitation by Client and/or on its behalf of the Services or the Platform, and any part thereof, shall immediately cease and expire. The following  Sections shall survive termination or expiration of the Terms: 2, 3.2, 7-9, 11-17.

d. In addition to termination rights under Section 12.d, upon termination by Yotpo, under this  Section 14, Client shall promptly pay Yotpo any and all applicable fees and payments due up to  and including the date of termination. Upon such termination by Client under this section, Yotpo shall promptly  refund to Client any fees previously paid by Client that pertain to any Services not yet provided as  of the date of termination. Except in the event of termination caused by an uncured, material  breach, fees paid are non-refundable. Notwithstanding anything else herein, bonus, or any credits, whether provided by Yotpo to Client for any reason or purchased for usage, are not refundable or redeemable for cash at any time.

e. Yotpo’s fees are exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, other charges, domestic or foreign imposed by any federal, state, or local tax authority with respect thereto including, for example, GST, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes,  assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). Client is responsible for paying  all Taxes associated with Client’s orders. If Yotpo has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes  for which Client is responsible under this Section 14, Yotpo will invoice Client and Client will pay  that amount unless Client provides Yotpo with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the  appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, Yotpo is solely responsible for Taxes assessable against it  based on its income, property and employees.

h. Yotpo may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise Yotpo’s rights (including without  limitation the provision of customer support), but Yotpo remains responsible for their  compliance with this Agreement and for its overall performance under this Agreement.

i. In any event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms herein and the terms of the Order Form,  the terms of the Order Form shall prevail. Any additional or conflicting terms contained in purchase  orders issued by Client with respect to the subject matter hereof are hereby expressly rejected  and shall have no force or effect on the terms of this Agreement or any Order Form.
