IN PARTICULAR, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY, QUANTITY, ACCURACY, OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE/SERVICES OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR RESOURCES LINKED TO THE SITE/SERVICES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY:  (A) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (B) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE; (C) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS OR OF ANY PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION; (D) ANY INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE; (E) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE; OR (F) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, E-MAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE/SERVICES.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED FIVE DOLLARS ($5.00).

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages.

**10\. Indemnity**

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our Affiliates, third-party service providers, employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors harmless from any and all liabilities, claims, demands, suits, investigations, losses, judgments, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) that arise out of or are related to your violation or alleged violation of these Terms or use of the Site/Services.

**11\. Dispute Resolution**

Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Site, or the Services, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a “Dispute”) shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If the parties are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute by sending notice demanding arbitration to the other party. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to American Arbitration Association rules and procedures for consumer arbitration (if you are a consumer) or commercial arbitration (if you are a business) (the “Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration shall be conducted in Franklin County, Ohio before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules with the option to appeal the arbitrator’s decision to an Optional Appellate Arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against any party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, arbitration costs and fees shall be divided equally between the parties. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, attorneys’ fees shall be borne by each party independently and no party shall be liable for the attorneys’ fees of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arbitrator determines that a filed Dispute is frivolous, the arbitrator, applying applicable law, may award the prevailing party its attorneys’ fees and costs. No Disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE; WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PRESENT ITS CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW; AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO BRING A DISPUTE MORE THAN ONE YEAR FROM WHEN IT KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE CONTROVERSY, CLAIM, OR FACTS FORMING THE BASIS OF THE DISPUTE. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s), if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Any matters submitted to a court for resolution shall be submitted to the state or federal courts of Franklin County, Ohio and all parties agree to the personal jurisdiction thereof.
