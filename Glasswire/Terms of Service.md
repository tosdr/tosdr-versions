2.1 **"GlassWire"** is designed to provide full visibility and control over digital traffic generated or received by a user endpoint on a computer network. Specifically, GlassWire allows for logging of traffic counters and IP address for traffic destination or origin. For the avoidance of doubt, GlassWire does NOT inspect the data packets going through an endpoint, it just records the quantity of traffic and the IP destination of such traffic to/from the endpoint, in order to make a user aware of any abnormal or unwanted data patterns occurring on their machines. GlassWire also allows a user to block any data traffic. The Services are described in further detail in the Documentation (and as may be subsequently revised with written agreement from GlassWire).

2.2 Subscribers are permitted to use the Services provided that the Subscriber has activated a valid license. Different license plans allow for different functionality. Certain plans require the purchase of a Subscription plan for each device being monitored
