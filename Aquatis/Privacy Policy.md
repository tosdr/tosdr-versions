Aquatis collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.

Aquatis may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Aquatis and its affiliates. Aquatis may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

#### **Use of Cookies**

The Aquatis website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Aquatis pages, or register with Aquatis site or services, a cookie helps Aquatis to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Aquatis website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Aquatis features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Aquatis services or websites you visit.

#### **Security of your Personal Information**

To secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, Aquatis uses the following:

Comodo

CloudFlare

Paypal

WHMCS

Stripe

When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

#### **Children Under Thirteen**

Aquatis does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website. We will call the current number to verify.
