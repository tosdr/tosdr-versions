Committing personal data marked with a star as well as allowing the use of cookies in the service user’s browser, is a requirement for our contractual relationship with the data subject. Without this necessary information we are not able to provide the Service.

#### **From where do we receive data?**

We receive the above mentioned personal data primarily from the data subject him/herself, as the data is entered into the Service by the data subject.

We receive the data subject’s e-mail address to which we send the granted Open Badge from our customer (as the data controller). We act as the data processor in this relationship.

For the purposes described in this privacy notice, personal data may also be collected and updated from publicly available sources and based on information received from authorities or other third parties within the limits of the applicable laws and regulations. Data updating of this kind is performed manually or by automated means.

We do not transfer personal data outside of EU/EEA.

#### **How do we protect the data and how long do we store them?**
