TABOOLA TERMS OF SERVICE
========================

These Terms of Service (“**TOS**”) apply to the content-delivery platforms, widgets, analytics tools, and other technical applications offered through third-party websites by Taboola, Inc. with registered office at 1115 Broadway, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10010, USA or its affiliates (“**Taboola**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”), described further below and collectively referred to as the “**Services**.”

The availability of the Services on a third-party website or application does not necessarily indicate any relationship or affiliation between us and those sites.

5\. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Notice
----------------------------------------------------

We are committed to complying with U.S. copyright and related laws, and we require all of our Customers who disseminate content through the Services to comply with these laws.  Accordingly, our users (including you) may not disseminate any material or content using the Services in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law.  Owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) to report alleged infringements.  It is our policy in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws to reserve the right to terminate the rights of any user to access the Services if any such user is either found to infringe third-party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who we believe, in our sole discretion, are infringing these rights. Upon our receipt of a proper notice of claimed infringement under the DMCA, we will respond expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the content in issue.  Our designated agent (_i.e.,_ the proper party) to whom you should address such notice is: [copyright@taboola.com](mailto:copyright@taboola.com).

If you believe that content that you or a third party owns has been used via the Services in a way that violates your or someone else’s copyright or other intellectual property rights, please provide us with the following information:

* an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
* a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
* a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located;
* your address, telephone number, and email address;
* a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and
* a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in your report is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

10\. General
------------

These TOS shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, unless otherwise stated by mandatory laws. Any action shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York and you hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue to the extent permitted by applicable law. In no event shall any claim, action, or proceeding by you related in any way to the Services be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.  If any provision of the TOS (or part of such provision) is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any court having competent jurisdiction, then that provision (or part of that provision) shall be deemed severable from the TOS and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions — that invalid or unenforceable (part of the) clause will be replaced by a valid and/or enforceable, as the case may be, (part of the) clause which is as close to the original intention of the parties as possible. The failure of Taboola to insist upon or enforce any of the provisions of these TOS, or to exercise any rights or remedies under these TOS, will not be construed as a waiver of Taboola’s right to assert or rely upon any such provisions, rights, or remedies in that or any other instance; rather, the same will be and remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these TOS shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. These TOS, the [Privacy Policy](https://www.taboola.com/privacy-policy), and the [Cookie Policy](https://www.taboola.com/cookie-policy) constitute the entire agreement between you and Taboola with respect to the offering of our Services to you.
