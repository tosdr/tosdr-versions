By using this site and/or downloading any material, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. This agreement applies to you and, if you are using this web site on your client\`s behalf, to you and all your clients. We reserve the right to change this agreement at any time without further notice. We reserve the right to update and/or change our pricing structure as needed including but not limited to changes based on our community, imagery database or market trends. Your use of the site will be subject to the most current version posted on the site at the time of your use. By using this site or downloading, uploading or using any media listed under the Dreamstime.com domain you agree to be bound by this Agreement. Should you disagree with anything stated here please discontinue your use of the site and erase all data you have downloaded. Where Dreamstime has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the page or site\`s functionalities, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Dreamstime. If there is any contradiction between the English language version and its translation in a different language, then the English language version shall take precedence.

**Use of this site**

This site is owned and operated by Dreamstime. All Media, audio and video material and related informational materials in any medium provided by Dreamstime hereunder, including related text, captions, or information (collectively referred to as Media) are owned by Dreamstime and by our Media providers (Contributors), members of our community. All Media is protected by US and international copyright laws.

This site contains both Media that depicts a visible watermark (Watermarked Media) and Media that does not contain a visible watermark (Non-Watermarked Media). Dreamstime allows you to search for, view, and use Watermarked Media only as permitted below. If you have registered for a Dreamstime account and Dreamstime has approved your registration, you may be able to access Non-Watermarked Media, which shall be used only as permitted below. Dreamstime reserves the right to revoke your authorization to view, download and use the Media and information available on this site at any time, and you agree to immediately discontinue your such use upon written notice from Dreamstime. All rights not specifically granted under this Agreement are reserved to Dreamstime. Additionally, we do not allow the use of automated software or other crawling techniques for searching our web site and/or retrieve Media or related information.

Dreamstime may immediately revoke all licenses granted to you without notice if you fail to comply with any provision of this agreement. If a license is revoked, you agree to immediately stop using this site and the Media, delete all Media and all copies from all media and destroy all other copies. Your use of this site and any Media shall comply with all applicable law. Dreamstime may restrict or remove your access to this site at any time, or restrict or remove the use of any Media for any reason, and may replace the Media with another Media, and you agree to immediately discontinue all use of the Media upon notification from Dreamstime.

Despite our best efforts to provide accurate information, this site may contain technical or other mistakes, inaccuracies or typographical errors. Additionally, this site and any Media may include historically and culturally important Media and text that may contain subjects that reflect the social attitudes and circumstances of a particular time or location. You should be aware that your search may display results containing content that may seem inappropriate to its context, or text that could be potentially offensive. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use of any Media requires the consent of any third party or the license of any additional rights, and you should not rely solely on the information provided by Dreamstime or its members. If you are unsure whether additional third-party rights are needed for your use, you are responsible for consulting with competent rights management professionals or legal counselors.

Dreamstime makes reasonable efforts to comply with and solve all issues regarding potential copyrights and trademarks available on the US and international market. While the responsibility for the Media uploaded is entirely on the Contributor\`s side, he/she being the one who holds all copyrights over the content submitted, we do our best to identify and solve any copyright or trademark infringements.

If you have found a file that represents such an infringement please notify us, in order that we may take the appropriate measures.

**Children**

Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use this site unsupervised and we ask that children do not register for an account or submit any personal information to us. By using this site unsupervised, and/or registering for an account, you warrant that you are 18 years of age or older.

Acknowledgements, Representations, and Warranties
-------------------------------------------------

**Acknowledgements, Representations, and Warranties**

By using the Website or any other of Our services, You thereby affirmatively acknowledge, represent, and warrant the truth and accuracy of each of the following statements:

a. Dreamstime provides access to an online service comprising information and materials created and posted by You and other users.

b. Media on the Website that is available for license is stored on Dreamstime\`s servers at the direction of Dreamstime\`s users.

c. Any modification of Media uploaded by Dreamstime\`s users, such as the addition of a Dreamstime watermark, is performed by an automated process. Accordingly, as the Contributor is aware that such modifications shall take place automatically upon upload, the Contributor shall be deemed the party responsible for such automatic modification and shall be considered the “author” of such automatically modified Media. Dreamstime is not responsible for modifications that occur to Media as part of its automatic posting process.

d. Any review of uploaded Media that may be performed by Dreamstime before making such Media available to the public is cursory and only intended to identify immediately obvious violations of these Terms. Accordingly, and despite any such gate keeping, the Contributor uploading an Media shall be deemed the party at whose direction that Media resides on Dreamstime\`s servers.

e. Dreamstime has never directed, and never will direct, its users to upload Media that infringe upon any right belonging to a third party. Uploading Media that infringe on third-party rights constitutes a direct and material violation of these express Terms and will subject the uploading Contributor\`s account to suspension and/or termination, where appropriate.

f. Dreamstime correctly presumes that the Contributor uploading an Media is the sole holder of all exclusive rights to that Media, except where the Media alone bears some obvious indication to the contrary, such as a visible proprietary marking identifying a Person other than the Contributor as the exclusive rights holder.

g. Where an Media has no obvious proprietary marking that indicates an exclusive owner, Dreamstime cannot be deemed to have actual knowledge that the Media infringes upon any third party\`s rights.

h. In collecting license fees on behalf of Contributors, and retaining a portion of those license fees, Dreamstime does not derive a direct financial benefit from any particular Media. Dreamstime\`s only direct financial benefit comes from operating its Website, which allows Contributors to market their Media to potential license purchasers. Contributors are the only parties receiving a direct financial benefit from their creation and uploading of Media for licensing by Dreamstime\`s users.

i. Dreamstime has no right or ability to control the activities of Contributors who create and upload Media to the Website. In the event that a Contributor infringes upon a third party\`s rights by creating or uploading an Media, that Contributor is the sole responsible party for such infringement, and Dreamstime has no control over such activity.

j. Apart from identifying an obvious proprietary marking in an Media that indicates an exclusive owner, Dreamstime has no other ability to determine whether the rights appurtenant to a particular Media may belong to a party other than the uploading Contributor. As its only other means of identifying Media that may infringe upon a third party\`s rights, Dreamstime relies entirely on properly presented notifications from third parties claiming that their rights have been violated.

k. Where you are established within the European Union, you qualify as a taxable person for VAT purposes and you will provide Dreamstime with any documentary evidence to this effect upon request (VAT number). In the event that such documentary evidence is not provided, you accept that Dreamstime will add the applicable VAT of your EU country to the price of services.

**Use of Watermarked Media - Using Media for comping**

Media includes without limitation all digital images, audio, audiovisual, video works and any related textual information (including captions and credits). Media includes visibly or electronically watermarked and reduced resolution Media (Non-Watermarked or Watermarked Media) or higher resolution non-watermarked Media (Non-Watermarked Media).

Conditional upon your compliance with this Agreement, Dreamstime grants you a limited license to download Watermarked Media solely for evaluating/comping whether you wish to purchase a license to the Non-Watermarked Media according to the Standard Terms and Conditions applicable to your use. You may not use a Watermarked Media in any final materials distributed within your company or any materials distributed outside of your company or to the public or in any online or other electronic distribution system. You may not modify, alter, or remove any visible or electronic watermark, or disassemble, reverse engineer, or decompile any Media. Except for this limited, internal testing and sample use, Dreamstime grants you no other rights, and you may not distribute, sublicense or make available for use or distribution any Watermarked Media.

Registering for an account
--------------------------

**Registering For A Dreamstime Account**

To obtain access to our Media as well as upload any Media, you have to apply for a Dreamstime account and you agree to provide complete, true and accurate information. Dreamstime reserves sole discretion over whether to grant you an account, and you agree to access the authorized sections of the web site and your account only by using the account login and password supplied to you by Dreamstime. By creating an account or otherwise using our website, you demonstrate your acceptance of these terms and of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.dreamstime.com/privacy), which is incorporated herein by this reference.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account number and/or password, if applicable, and you shall not distribute this access information or allow others to use this access information to gain access to this site. You agree to take reasonable steps to prevent others from obtaining your access information and to notify Dreamstime of any unauthorized access or need to update or remove access for any of your employees or agents. You shall be liable for payment for all Media downloaded by others using your account, with or without your permission or knowledge prior to the time that you notify Dreamstime of any unauthorized use. You agree that you shall not acquire any rights of use, ownership, or bailment as a result of using any Dreamstime account or web site or related services.

At anytime, you may request your account access to be restricted, but Dreamstime reserves the right to delay your request until all requirements of this Agreement are met. Only accounts without any activity related to the site\`s services or products, can be permanently deleted. Accounts with activity will be blocked and archived on our servers for further reference. Access to these accounts is limited and provided only to a part of the Dreamstime admin staff, for legal purposes.

After acquiring a credits package or subscription, you can download Media using various licenses available on our site. These licenses are awarded to the account owner (person or organization). This is a one-person license and can be used only by the account owner or his employee, for the company\`s own projects or clients and cannot be transmitted to another party. If the Media is to be used for more projects, you must purchase a separate license for each of these projects. If the Media is to be used by more employees, then an Unlimited Extended License (U-EL) [Unlimited Extended License (U-EL)](https://www.dreamstime.com/terms#u-el) is required or you can contact us at [https://www.dreamstime.com/corporate](https://www.dreamstime.com/corporate) for customized company solutions.

**None of our Media may be resold or redistributed by any means, or made available for redistribution or resale by a third party without Dreamstime\`s separate written consent.**

If required, you may purchase Media on behalf of a third party, such as your client, organization, employer, etc. Please indicate on the [My Downloads page](https://www.dreamstime.com/downloads.php) the full name of any third party on whose behalf you have purchased a particular piece of Media by clicking the \`Client name\` link in the row for that piece of Media, which will automatically extend the purchased license for that Media to the indicated third party. For the avoidance of doubt, each individual Media license may only be extended to one third party. Should you desire to use a piece of Media for more than one third party, you must purchase a separate license for each third party and assign each license to the designated third party as described above. By designating a third party for any Media license that you purchase, you thereby affirmatively represent and warrant that (i) such third party has agreed to be bound by this Agreement; and (ii) you are fully responsible for any claims that may arise from such third party\`s use of the Media. If you require any further information about Media licensing on behalf of third parties, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://www.dreamstime.com/contact).

Royalty-Free concept
--------------------

**Royalty-Free License - Concept Info**

What Royalty-Free means is that you pay for the Media only once and then you can use it in perpetuity and worldwide, with just a few restrictions. In other words, there are no license fees except the initial fee and no other royalties to be paid except those included in the initial cost. You are allowed to use the image for an unlimited number of copies, printed and/or electronic.

The Royalty-Free license is granted ONLY for the non-watermarked Media you buy using the Download button; all the other versions (small watermarked and non-watermarked thumbnails which are visible on the public site) are entirely copyrighted.

The free files downloaded from the Free Photos section may be used in commercial projects under our [limited Royalty Free (RF-LL) license](https://www.dreamstime.com/terms#using) and according to our terms and conditions. This is a one-person license and is given to you as a designer, your employer (client) or any employed persons.

**Unlimited seats (U-EL):**

This license extends our regular Royalty Free / Editorial license to an unlimited number of seats within the same organization. It is an additional license to the usage included within the regular Royalty-Free / Editorial license that awards rights for a single person within the same company. The U-EL license is applied only for the staff of the organization that holds the account. The number of copies allowed is unlimited for each designer/employee.

**Web Usage (W-EL):**

Electronic Items for Resale/Distribution: this license includes the right to use the media in webtemplates that are sold to more customers, screensavers, e-cards, powerpoint presentations or as wallpapers on cell phones.

This license represents a full ownership of the downloaded media.

The agency will disable the media immediately after the buyer acquired this license. The Contributor is required to disable the file permanently from all other places where he may sell it, as soon as possible after the sale occurred, but no longer than 72 hours. This license grants the buyer exclusivity so the Contributor needs to keep in mind that exclusive media is represented by concepts, models, wardrobe, and subject matter which provide a unique creative message and small variations in the image (variations in camera angle, model posture or gesture, for example) do not enable other files as being different. All such variations rendering the media very similar in concept and message to the one sold under SR-EL should be removed from sale as well. The photographer acknowledge and agrees to provide the buyer with full ownership for the file retrieved using the SR-EL license.

**Time Limited Exclusivity (SR-EL1, SR-EL3):**

This license represents an exclusive right to use the downloaded media, but such exclusivity will only last for a limited period of time. The buyer can use the media exclusively (exclusivity applies from the moment that the file was downloaded using this license) during the time period selected, and include it in any type of design with just a few restrictions: sensitive subjects may still apply and the buyer may not claim that the file was created by him nor resell it as his work \[photo/media\].

Dreamstime will disable the image immediately after the buyer acquired this license. The Contributor will be required to disable the file permanently from all other places where he or she may sell it, as soon as possible after the sale occured, but no longer than 72 hours. The Contributor acknowledges and agrees to provide the buyer with the exclusive right to use the file retrieved using the SR-EL1 or SR-EL3 licenses, for the duration of the selected exclusivity period.

The length of time for the exclusivity period depends on which license is selected. SR-EL1 will grant an exclusive right to use the media for one year. Similarly, SR-EL3 will grant an exclusive right to use the image for three years. The print run for both licenses is unlimited and continues after the exclusivity expired. At the end of the exclusivity period, the buyer\`s license will continue as before, with all of the same rights, except for the right of exclusivity, and the image will again be added to the available library of media on Dreamstime.com and again be made available to all users for purchase. After the end of the exclusivity period, the Contributor will also be free to offer the media for download from other places where the Contributor sells his or her media.

If a Model Release is available on file, it will remain within our database, a proof about its existence can be forwarded to the buyer, however, the MR info will still not be disclosed in respect of the Contributors\` and models\` privacy.These are additional licenses to the rights included within the regular Royalty-Free license.

Model and property releases/clearances
--------------------------------------

**Model and property releases/clearances**

With respect to Media for which you have purchased a license through Dreamstime, the rights that Dreamstime grant to you do not include a license to any person, place, property, or subject matter depicted in a Media, which may be subject to copyrights, trademarks, rights of publicity, moral rights, property rights or other rights belonging to third parties. Dreamstime makes no representations or warranties that it owns or licenses any rights nor does Dreamstime grant you any rights including copyright, trademarks, or rights of publicity belonging to any person, place, property, or subject matter depicted in any Media. Furthermore, Dreamstime makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information provided with the Media. You are solely responsible for determining whether your use of any Media requires the consent of any third party or the license of any additional rights, and you should not rely solely on the information provided by Dreamstime. If you are unsure whether additional rights are needed for your use, you are responsible for obtaining competent legal counsel.

With respect to Media you upload as a Contributor, where such Media depicts one or more individuals, a model release document must be uploaded confirming that the individuals included in your Media have signed a written release. By uploading this document, you certify that the information contained therein is complete and accurate.  
With respect to any personal data included on any release document you provide, you acknowledge and agree that you are the data controller or processor, and Dreamstime is the data processor or sub-processor, as applicable, and accordingly Dreamstime agrees that it shall process all personal data in accordance with its [Privacy Policy](https://www.dreamstime.com/privacy). If you are a data processor, you warrant to Dreamstime that your instructions and actions with respect to personal data, including your appointment of Dreamstime as another processor, have been authorized by the relevant controller. Dreamstime will promptly notify you of any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data included on any release document you provide.

Dreamstime prefers that its contributing users provide copies of release documents that include physical signatures for the individuals consenting to the capture and reproduction of the contributed Media. Recognizing that many of Dreamstime\`s contributing users desire to submit location and model releases that have been e-signed, rather than printing documents for physical signature by a releasing individual, Dreamstime has determined to accept, under certain circumstances, e-signed release documents from certain qualifying contributors. Acceptance by Dreamstime of an e-signed release from a particular user shall not constitute a guarantee that future e-signed releases will be accepted from such user. Dreamstime reserves the right to refuse e-signed releases, whether for a particular Media or from a particular user, for any reason.

If you are qualified to submit e-signed releases to Dreamstime, you will be asked to separately represent and warrant, at the time of uploading a particular e-signed release, that (i) any submitted e-signed release was prepared in compliance with all requirements of the United States\` Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act); (ii) such e-signed releases have been reviewed and accepted by each individual whose rights the e-signed releases purport to release; (iii) multiple e-signed releases have been submitted and shall be submitted for Media portraying the same individual, which Media were captured on different calendar days; however, only one single MR document/age group should be uploaded in the model release library ; and (iv) you have not submitted and shall not submit any e-signed release that is fraudulent or otherwise unenforceable. If Dreamstime authorizes you to submit e-signed releases, you agree to maintain copies of each e-signed release submitted to Dreamstime for as long as the associated Media is available for download from Dreamstime and for a period of three (3) years following the Media\`s removal from Dreamstime. You further agree to provide Dreamstime with additional copies of any e-signed release upon request.

If Media is designated as model-released, it means the contributing member posting such Media has represented to Dreamstime that the depicted individual(s) has/have signed a release permitting reproduction of the Media, subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, sensitive subject uses. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Dreamstime is not responsible for instances where a contributing member has misrepresented that he or she has obtained a signed model release for all individuals depicted in a particular Media. If Dreamstime incorrectly indicates that a Media is model-released when it is not, Dreamstime\`s liability shall be limited to the amount you paid Dreamstime for the use of the Media. If a Media depicts an individual and you use such Media in a manner that implies the use or endorsement of a product or service by depicted individual, you must indicate wherever the Media is publicly visible that the individual depicted is a model and used only for illustrative purposes. Under no circumstances may you use an Media depicting one or more individuals in a context suggesting that such individual(s) are endorsing a subject that might be seen as sensitive (as described above). Any license obtained through Dreamstime is conditioned upon your obtaining all necessary third-party rights, releases and permissions. You agree to provide Dreamstime with proof of such releases and permissions upon request.

Refund policy
-------------

**Refund policy**

You may ask for a refund of your purchase within 30 days from the purchase date. Please note that refunds will only be permitted if the plan you purchased (whether credits or subscription) has not been used to download any Media. Note: Refunds will not be given for the first subscription fee charged after a promo deal subscription if any Media has been downloaded during the promo deal period. Also, if you elect to be billed in installments, your yearly subscription plan cannot be stopped and refunded once your first renewal payment comes into effect.

If you have downloaded a piece of Media that has technical flaws, please contact us for a refund of credits used for downloading the Media. If you are not able to download a particular piece of Media, we will refund the credits used to purchase that piece of Media, provided that Dreamstime determines you have been unable to download the Media successfully. If several credits are deducted from your account, due to multiple unsuccessful attempts of retrieving the file, you should email support for a refund of the extra credits. Downloads will not be refunded if more than 7 days from the download date have passed.

Purchase
--------

**Automatic Renewals**

Subscriptions renew on a periodic basis, based on the term that you choose (e.g., monthly), at the rate disclosed at the time of purchase and are billed to the payment method associated with your user account up to 48 hours in advance of the current subscription period end date. Discount and promo plans renew at regular rates, unless specified otherwise. Up to 5,000 unused downloads may be rolled over to the next month for as long as your subscription is active. Up to 2,000 unused downloads from an expired subscription may be rolled over to a new identical or higher cost plan, only in special cases and with prior written notice, if the new plan is purchased within 30 days after the original subscription’s expiration date.

To continue your downloads without interruption, credit packages and subscriptions that you purchase will renew automatically. Until canceled, renewal purchase prices will remain the same as your initial purchase price, except for promo and discount purchases unless otherwise specified, even if credit package or subscription prices are later increased ; provided, however, that we reserve the right to discontinue any subscription package at any time, in our sole discretion, with written notice to you. If we discontinue your subscription plan, and you do not choose a different plan before your next renewal date, we will select an available plan that we believe is adequate for your requirements based on past purchases.

You may be given the option to pay for yearly subscription plans in 12 monthly installments. If you elect to be billed in installments, your yearly subscription plan will be billed on a monthly basis for 12 months. You may elect at any time to convert your 12-month subscription into a monthly subscription, which may be cancelled before the end of the original 12-month subscription period, by payment of the difference between the discounted monthly price for your 12-month subscription and the current price of a monthly subscription, multiplied by the number of months completed for your original 12-month subscription. As with any other subscription package, at the end of a yearly subscription, your package will automatically renew at the same rate as your initial purchase price for another 12 months unless you cancel the package before the subscription renewal date.

If you elect not to continue your subscription after any trial or promo period, you must cancel your subscription before the renewal charge date, as specified after the purchase and on your \`Payment Profiles\` page, to avoid paying a fee for the next subscription period. If you do not cancel before the renewal charge date, your account will be charged the periodic fee associated with the chosen subscription.

Subject to the foregoing, you may cancel automatic renewals at any time from your [Payment Profiles](https://www.dreamstime.com/card_management.php) page, but please note that in order to cancel a yearly subscription package that has already begun, you must first convert it to a monthly plan, subject to payment of the difference in subscription price as described above. If your permitted cancellation request is not received in time, and your credit card is billed despite your desire to cancel your subscription, please contact customer support by phone (+1-615.771.5611) or [email](https://www.dreamstime.com/contact) so that we may refund your subscription fee, provided you have not yet used any of the download credits associated with such subscription renewal. Fees charged to your payment method may be split into multiple charges, the aggregate of which shall not exceed the amount currently due for your particular purchase.

**Arbitration**

All Disputes (including any dispute relating to the arbitrability of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement or any other dispute relating to arbitration) must be submitted to arbitration before and in accordance with the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules and applying the laws in effect in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The term \`Dispute\` means any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Dreamstime website, the services offered through the website, or this Agreement, or any breach thereof, including any claim that this Agreement, or any part of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or otherwise voidable or void.

Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction and will be binding, final and non-appealable. You and Dreamstime hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that in the event of a dispute between them, each shall be limited to the recovery of any actual damages sustained by it.

Contributors rights
-------------------

**Contributors rights & obligations - non-exclusivity and exclusivity:**

Dreamstime.com allows you the opportunity to work with Dreamstime.com in one of three manners: contributors who upload Media which are available for sale with other stock agencies (NON-EXCLUSIVE CONTRIBUTORS), contributors that upload Media that are exclusively sold on Dreamstime.com (EXCLUSIVE IMAGES) and contributors that are solely represented by Dreamstime.com (EXCLUSIVE CONTRIBUTORS).

Contributors are required to keep at least seventy (70%) percent of their portfolio online with Dreamstime.com for a period of at least six (6) months. You may disable all files older than six months from the date of review at any time. You will be allowed to disable a total of thirty (30%) percent of your total Media submitted within the past six (6) months. Media that was disabled and then enabled again will be counted as new submissions, no matter of their original upload date.

Contributors shall receive a percentage (a Revenue Share) from each sale made by Dreamstime on their behalf as described in the paragraphs below. Considering the dynamic nature of the industry, Dreamstime and its distributors, affiliates, referrals etc. can represent the Contributors using different marketing techniques or models (such as credit based or subscription payment plans, third party distributors etc.). Contributor acknowledges and agrees that each of these varied marketing techniques and models may result in different net sale prices for the same image under each set of circumstances. The paragraphs below mention the minimum Revenue Share that is to be awarded to a Contributor from the net sale price collected for the Contributor\`s image, unless otherwise mentioned in different areas of the site (such as the [Alliances section](https://www.dreamstime.com/alliances) or [Sell your Media section](https://www.dreamstime.com/https://www.dreamstime.com/sell-stock-photos-images)). Revenue Shares are calculated based on net sales amounts after payment of referral fees, as described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided Contributor is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Dreamstime will not seek repayment of any overpayments made to Contributor. No Dreamstime user shall be entitled to receive payment, nor shall Dreamstime be liable for any such payment, unless and until the total amount of that Contributor’s unpaid earnings exceeds One Hundred U.S. Dollars (US$100.00).

Contributors are not allowed to download their portfolio (partly or completely) , especially if this is performed in order to take advantage of any available discounts and bonuses provided by Dreamstime.com. Contributors who lost their own Media during a hardware failure are asked to contact support in order to receive a copy of their own files.

**Non-exclusive contributors:** A non-exclusive contributor is an artist who uploads Media that are also available for sale with other stock agencies. These contributors may upload their Media to Dreamstime.com while selling the same Media through other channels. Non-exclusive contributors shall receive 25-50% of the net sale price received by Dreamstime.com for the Media they have contributed to the site which are subsequently sold by Dreamstime.com.

**Exclusive Media::** A contributor may work with other agencies in addition to Dreamstime.com. However, the Media provided to Dreamstime.com and marked as being exclusive are sold only on Dreamstime.com. An exclusive image is represented by concepts, models, wardrobe, and subject matter which provide a unique creative message and small variations in the image (variations in camera angle, model posture or gesture, for example) do not enable an image as being different. Exclusive Media may only be sold through Dreamstime.com and may not be offered through other channels. Contributors shall receive 27.5%-55% of the net sale price received by Dreamstime.com for the exclusive Media they have contributed to the site which are subsequently sold by Dreamstime.com. A Contributor may remove the exclusivity rights to an image with thirty (30) days prior written notice to Dreamstime.com.

**Exclusive contributors::** An exclusive contributor is not represented by any other agency and will work solely with Dreamstime.com for selling their Media. Exclusive contributors may, however, sell their other artwork on a Contributor-to-client basis, under a work for hire contract, outside of this Agreement. Exclusive contributors shall receive sixty (60%) percent of the net sale price received by Dreamstime.com for the exclusive Media they have contributed to the site which are subsequently sold by Dreamstime.com, as well as a commission of $0.20 (twenty cents), awarded unconditionally for the first 100 submissions uploaded and accepted by Dreamstime.com. Once an exclusive contributor exceeds 100 approved submissions, the upload bonus is awarded for up to **first 10,000 approved** files only if their downloads/image average is **\> 0.1**. This means there should be a balance between uploads and downloads and an exclusive portfolio is expected to generate sales in order to continue receiving the upload bonus after the initial 100 approved files.

Dreamstime.com is under no obligation, however, to accept an exclusive contributor’s submissions and acceptance of Media is at Dreamstime.com’s sole discretion. Dreamstime.com may terminate an Exclusive Contributor’s status at any time with no advance notice; an Exclusive Contributor may terminate their status as an Exclusive Contributor with thirty (30) days prior written notice to Dreamstime.com. If an Exclusive Contributor terminates this Agreement prior to the passage of six (6) months, Dreamstime.com reserves the right to recover all commission payments made to the Exclusive Contributor prior to the termination of Exclusive Contributor status. These payments include the upload bonus received after each accepted submission and the extra Revenue Share earned by exclusive contributors.

If a contributor breaks this Exclusivity Agreement, either for an exclusive image or as an exclusive contributor, Dreamstime.com reserves the right to invalidate and recover all earnings made by that Contributor through Dreamstime.com sales commencing with the date the exclusive image or Media or portfolio were made subject to the Exclusivity Agreement.

Dreamstime.com reserves the right to take any actions that it deems necessary to protect its rights, all rights of which are specifically reserved.
