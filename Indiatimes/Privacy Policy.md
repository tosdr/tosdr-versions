TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD COUNTRY
------------------------------------------

The information we collect about you, in certain cases is transferred to the servers hosted in third countries, by the third parties engaged by us.

We ask individual Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.

Your right to review, update, correct, and/or delete your personal information may be limited, subject to the law of your jurisdiction, in the following scenarios:

If your requests are unreasonably excessive or repetitive,

Where the rights or safety of another person or persons would be jeopardized, or

Your right to review, update, correct, and delete your information is subject to our records retention policies and applicable law, including any statutory retention requirements.

SECURITY: HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. All information gathered on Site is securely stored within the Company controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.

We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our control. You play an important role in keeping your personal information secure.

CHANGES TO PRIVACY NOTICE

Any changes we make will be effective immediately on notice, which we may give by posting the new policy on the Sites. Your use of the Sites or Services after such notice will be deemed acceptance of such changes.

We may also make reasonable efforts to inform you via electronic mail. In any case, you are advised to review this Policy periodically on the Sites to ensure that you are aware of the latest version.
