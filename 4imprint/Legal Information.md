Copyrighted and trademarked artwork belonging to other individuals or entities may not be used as artwork in products that we print unless you have the owner’s express permission to do so.  We reserve the right to (i) request confirmation of such permission, and (ii) refuse the order if, in our sole discretion, it appears that the final product would violate applicable laws. We follow this policy because a failure to do so could result in legal action by the owner.  Further, subject matter that is deemed by us to contain derogatory, inflammatory or objectionable remarks, images or symbols will not be accepted. Examples of this include derogatory, inflammatory or objectionable content about an individual or a group’s race, religion, national origin, physical attributes, sexual preference or content containing profanity or pornography.
