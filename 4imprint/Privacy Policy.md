Scope and Purpose of this Policy
--------------------------------

This policy applies to any individual who accesses our online presences and provides any type or amount of personal information. Personal information, in general, is information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a natural person. The purpose of this policy is to explain how and what personal information we collect, how we use this information, and to express our commitment to protecting your privacy.

Section A: Information Collected and How it is Used
---------------------------------------------------

Please note that we collect and store certain limited information related to your visits and interactions with our site. What we collect and how we use it is set forth below.

### What we collect when you browse our site:

If you do nothing during your visit but browse, read content, or download information, we will gather and store certain limited information about your visit. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

1. Your IP address, which is an identifier assigned either to your internet service or directly to your computer. We use the IP address to direct internet traffic to you;
2. Your browsing behavior, which includes your browser and device characteristics;
3. The date and time you visited;
4. The pages or services you accessed; and
5. Any referring URLs, or sites that directed you to our site.

The information we automatically collect or store is not personally identifiable information ([see Section B](#secB)), and used by us only for improving the content of our site services and to help us understand how people are using our services so that we may continually improve the performance, suitability and usefulness of our sites to you, our customers and potential customers.

### What else we collect if you provide it to us:

If, during your visit, you participate in a survey, send an e-mail, or perform some other transaction ([see Section C](#secC)) on-line, we will have collected the following information (some of which may be personally identifiable) in addition to information listed above:

1. The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who communicate with us via e-mail;
2. The contents of chats, for those who communicate with us via live chats with a 4imprint representative;
3. Information volunteered in response to a survey or by participating in a contest or other promotion sponsored by us;
4. Information volunteered during your registration on our site; and
5. Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other purpose, including requests to receive samples or marketing information, credit applications (for businesses), subscriptions to our newsletter or other content, and use of our on-line order forms to order products or services.

We will use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you or to address issues you may identify, and as a means to further improve our services or site. If you have an account with us, we will also use this information for marketing and promotions, to launch product surveys, and as an added service to you to pre-populate on-line order forms to save you time in the ordering and re-ordering process.

All of the information we collected is retained as long as legally required or for as long as necessary for legitimate business purposes, whichever is longer.

### Use and disclosure of information collected:

Please note that there are instances where we share your volunteered information with other parties for legitimate business purposes in connection with processing your order.

4IMPRINT, like many internet and catalog retailers, employs other companies and individuals to perform specific functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivery of packages, mail and e-mail, address hygiene, credit card processing services, or research that improves the quality of services or offers provided to you. These providers have access only to the information that they require to perform their functions but are contractually prohibited by us from using that information for any other purposes. You may, however, “opt-out” of this use of your information at any time, but doing so may impair our ability to provide you with proper service and to process your orders ([see Section K](#secK)).

We may disclose your name and mailing address to other carefully-screened parties for marketing purposes. However, we never share your e-mail address, phone number, credit card or financial information for these purposes.

Please refer to [see Section L](#secL) for additional notifications and information that we collect, disclose, and sell.

Section B: Personally Identifiable Information and Choice
---------------------------------------------------------

You may always choose whether to provide personal information to us on-line.

Personal information, in general, is information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a natural person. Personal information includes such things as an individual’s name, address, and phone number. As noted above ([see Section A](#secA)), none of your personal information is collected automatically when you access our site; personal information is only collected by us when you voluntarily provide it to us.

You may always choose not to contact us by e-mail, participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an on-line form. Alternative methods for contacting us in person, by phone or by mail are available by using the information in the Contact Information section at the end of this policy ([see Section K](#secK)). Your choice to not participate in these activities on-line will not impair your ability to browse, read or download content provided via the site.

In the event we are required to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, your personal information may be disclosed pursuant to such subpoena, court order or other legal process, which may be without notice to you.

Section C: Transaction Information
----------------------------------

If you request any information, buy any products or subscribe to any services offered by us via our site, we will ask you to complete an order form that requires certain information, including payment information such as a credit card number and expiration date as well as general contact, billing and shipping information. This information is necessary to complete the transaction and to deliver to you the information, products or services ordered and to collect payment.

The credit card information that you provide to us will be provided to the credit card issuing company to complete your transaction, and 4imprint makes no assurances or representations about the use of your information by these third parties. For your protection, all such information is collected, and all credit card information is stored by 4imprint via encrypted means.

Section D: Review and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can contact us about the any personally identifiable information we collect about you by using the information below (which is also in the Contact Information section at the end of this policy ([see Section K](#secK))). You may recommend changes to your personally identifiable information you believe to be inaccurate by submitting an e-mail or written request that credibly shows the inaccuracy. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

If your personal information changes, you may correct, update or remove the personal data you have provided to us by making changes to your profile. In addition, you may opt-out of certain communications from us ([see Section K](#secK)). Our goal is to make sure that our information about you is always current so that we can better serve you.

Section E: Cookies, Interest-Based Advertising and Opt-Outs
-----------------------------------------------------------

To serve our on-line users, we use "cookies" and other technologies to passively collect demographic information, customize your browsing experience with us, personalize your experience on our site and monitor advertisements and other activities. Cookies are small data files transferred to your computer by your web browser. We use the cookies feature only to store a randomly generated identifying tag on your computer or electronic device.

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking by disabling cookies in your browser. However, if you disable cookies, your experience on our website may be affected.

Although we don’t use cookies to collect or share information with third parties to deliver advertisements online referred to as Interest-based or behavioral advertising, you can learn more about those types of advertising and how to set your preferences (opt-out) here: [Find out more about your options opens in new window.](https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/faq/?tab=3)

Section F: Electronic Communication
-----------------------------------

When you access our site or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically and consenting to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by e-mail or by posting notices via our site. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, email [\[email protected\]](https://www.4imprint.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or find additional ways to [contact us here](https://www.4imprint.com/info/contactus).

Section G: Security and Social Media
------------------------------------

We safeguard the integrity of our site with measures designed and intended to prevent the corruption of data and to block unknown or unauthorized access to our systems and information. However, it is important to recognize that whatever you transmit or disclose online could be collected and used by others or even unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the internet can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure and by transmitting your data in this matter you agree to release 4imprint from any liability for damages incurred as a result of transmission. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us.

You may also take steps of your own to protect your information. For example, you should create a unique, quality password and not share that password with others or use it on any other website. You should not leave your computer or electronic device unattended before exiting a session and prior to logging out. You should also properly exit browsers as you move between websites. Please see the [4imprint Legal Statement](https://www.4imprint.com/info/legalstatement) for additional details.

Section H: A Special Note for Parents
-------------------------------------

Our website is not designed to normally collect information on and/or from minors. While our site is intended for general audiences, it is possible that minors will access the site and certain information automatically collected ([see Section A](#secA)). However, we will never knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If we receive any information from persons we believe to be minors, it will be purged from our database in accordance with any applicable laws.

Section I: Disclaimer - Links to Other Sites
--------------------------------------------

This policy applies only to the 4IMPRINT sites. Although our site may provide links to other sites, including but not limited to, social media sites where 4IMPRINT may utilize an account on the platform, be advised that 4IMPRINT is not responsible for the content of such other sites and is not liable for any damages or injury arising from that content. Any links are provided merely as a convenience to our users. When you link to another site, you are no longer on a 4IMPRINT site and this privacy policy will not apply. When you link to a site, you are subject to, and should consult, the privacy policy of that site, and particularly before providing any personal information.

Section J: Revision
-------------------

We may at any time revise the terms and conditions contained in this privacy policy by updating this posting. Accordingly, you should periodically visit this page to review our current privacy policy.
