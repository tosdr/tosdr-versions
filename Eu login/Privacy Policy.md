Privacy Statement
-----------------

Privacy statement for users registered with the European Commission's Identity and Access Management Service (IAMS)  
(DPR-EC-03187)

### 1\. INTRODUCTION

The European Commission (hereafter 'the Commission') is committed to protect your personal data and to respect your privacy. The Commission collects and further processes personal data pursuant to [Regulation (EU) 2018/1725](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data (repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001).

This privacy statement explains the reason for the processing of your personal data, the way we collect, handle and ensure protection of all personal data provided, how that information is used and what rights you have in relation to your personal data. It also specifies the contact details of the responsible Data Controller with whom you may exercise your rights, the Data Protection Officer and the European Data Protection Supervisor.

The information in relation to processing operation 'EU Login', undertaken by EC DIGIT B3, is presented below.

### 2\. WHY AND HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

Purpose of the processing operation:  
EU Login is the European Commission's central authentication service.  
It acts as an authentication service that verifies the identity of the user and it allows users to access a wide range of European Commission resources including websites, applications and services, by using a single account.  
Identity and Access Management Service (IAMS - DPR-EC-08606) provides EU Login with the necessary information to create EU Login accounts.  
EU Login can be used by any individual either at its own initiative (by either creating a self-registered account, using an existing account on one of the following social media platforms: Meta/Facebook, X/Twitter, Google, or using its own eID) or at the initiative of the organization they represent, by automatic transfer of information from the user's organization to the European Commission. In all of these cases, EU Login will create a user account.

EU Login also adds a layer of protection to the sign-in process, through the multifactor authentication (2FA or MFA). It provides the following easy to use verification methods:

**For EU Institutions staff:**

* simple user password
* OTP (one Time Password) sent as SMS to the user's mobile (GSM) number registered in the personal EU Login profile
* EU Login Mobile Application (PIN code, or any alternate capabilities offered by the owned mobile device)
* Physical Security Tokens (Security Keys)
* Trusted Platforms
* Physical Security Tokens (OTP enabled) provided by the organization

**For self-registered individuals (including identity federation with eID and social media accounts):**

* simple user password
* OTP (One Time Password)sent as SMS to the user's mobile (GSM) number registered in the personal EU Login profile
* EU Login Mobile Application (PIN code, or any alternate capabilities offered by the owned mobile device)
* Physical Security Tokens (Security Keys)
* Trusted Platforms

Your personal data will not be used for an automated decision-making, including profiling.

Individual Commission (and other EU Institutions) sites and applications that use EU Login for authenticating users, may nevertheless collect additional personal data themselves. This data processing will be covered by the relevant sites' own privacy statements.

### 3\. ON WHAT LEGAL GROUND(S) DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We process your personal data, because:

(a) Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Union institution or body;

The processing is necessary for the performance and support of tasks carried out by the institution as mandated by the Treaties, in particular Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 17, of the Treaty of the European Union and Articles 2, 4, 67, 310, 325 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.

Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/46 of 10 January 2017 on the security of communication and information systems in the European Commission and Information Security Policy and Internal Rules for handling ICT Information Security Incidents, the Commission Information Systems Security Policy C(2006)3602.

This processing operation is also in line with Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 on establishing a single digital gateway to provide access to information, to procedures and to assistance and problem-solving services and amending Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 and within the scope of the EC's eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 on accelerating the digital transformation of governments.
