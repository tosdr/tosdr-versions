Revised: Jan 1st, 2023

These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”) are entered into between illumin, an Ontario corporation with offices at 70 University Ave, Suite 1200 Toronto, ON M5J 2M4 Canada and the entity specified in the applicable Insertion Order (the “IO”, and together with the Terms and Conditions, the “Agreement”) with offices at the address specified in the IO. illumin reserves the right to update and change these Terms and Conditions from time to time without notice to Advertiser.

#### 1\. Definitions

For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms are defined as follows:

1.1 “Ad” means any advertisement (including, without limitation, all logos, trademarks, creative materials, graphic images and copy therein) provided to illumin, directly or indirectly, by Advertiser, including without limitation banner advertisements, text advertisements and video advertisements (as such terms are understood in the online advertising industry) and advertisements received from Contracted Clients.

1.2 “Ad Exchange” shall mean any exchange where Ad Inventory can be purchased can be purchased through an Auction.

1.3 “Ad Inventory” shall mean any digital advertising inventory made available for sale through an Ad Exchange, including, but not limited to, web display, mobile, application and/or widget-based advertising inventory.

1.4 “Advertiser” shall mean the Advertiser set forth in the IO and shall, for purposes of Advertiser’s obligations under these Terms and Conditions, include any Contracted Client. The obligations of Advertiser and a Contracted Client under this Agreement shall be joint and several.

1.5 “Auction” means the real-time bidding process for Ad Inventory offered through Ad Exchanges.

1.6 “Campaign” means the advertisement campaign to be operated by Advertiser through the Platform.

1.7 “Platform” means the advertising machine learning advertising platform developed and owned by illumin.  
For clarity, all capitalized terms used in these Terms and Conditions but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the IO.

#### 2\. License

2.1 illumin hereby grants to Advertiser a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform for purposes of conducting Campaigns during the Term in accordance with this Agreement. As between Advertiser and illumin, Advertiser acknowledges that illumin is the owner of all intellectual property rights in and to the Platform including all content thereon (other than the Ads) and, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, Advertiser shall not at any time do or suffer to be done any act or thing that will in any way impair the rights of illumin in and to the Platform. Nothing in this Agreement grants, nor shall Advertiser acquire hereby, any right, title or interest in or to the Platform or any goodwill associated with the Platform, other than those rights expressly granted hereunder. Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights in the Platform granted to Advertiser hereunder shall automatically revert to illumin, and Advertiser shall have no further rights in the Platform.

2.2 illumin will provide Platform and sales training as well as support over the phone and WebEx as needed by Advertiser. An aggregate of thirty (30) hours of such training and support will be provided to Advertiser during any twelve consecutive months at no additional charge. If Advertiser requests more than 30 hours of training and support, Advertiser will pay illumin for consulting services at a rate of one-hundred dollars ($100) net per hour. If Advertiser requests in person training, Advertiser will reimburse illumin for all reasonable out of pocket expenses.

2.3 Advertiser’s use of the Platform shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and ordinances as well as any written policies or procedures that illumin may provide to Advertiser from time to time in connection with Advertiser’s use of the Platform. illumin reserves the right to monitor the Platform and Advertiser’s use of the Platform from time to time in its sole discretion.

#### 3\. Sales agency

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, illumin hereby grants Advertiser the limited, non-transferrable right (the “Selling Rights”) to act as the sales representative for the Platform (the “Sales Agency Services”) and to provide advertising services to third parties through the Platform (“Advertiser Services”). Exercise of these rights entitle Advertiser:

3.1 to advertise the existence of the Platform and the Advertiser Services;

3.2 to enter into and execute agreements (in such form as illumin may approve from time to time) in respect of the Advertiser Services (the “Advertiser Agreements”). For purposes of this Agreement, upon entering into an Advertiser Agreement, a third party shall be a “Contracted Client”;

3.3 to process all payments from Contracted Clients received in connection with the Advertiser Services (the “Payment Processing”);

3.4 to carry out such other duties and obligations as are specifically authorized by this Agreement.

Exercise of the Selling Rights shall be at Advertiser’s sole cost and expense and shall require Advertiser to provide to illumin such content and information about the Contracted Client and the Advertiser Services to be provided to such Contracted Client, as illumin may request.

For the avoidance of doubt, Advertiser shall not permit any Contracted Client to directly use or access the Platform without the written consent of illumin. Rather, Advertiser shall only have the right to use the Platform on behalf of, and for the Contracted Client’s benefit.

Advertiser shall submit to illumin for review any and all advertisements and/or marketing materials (collectively, “Marketing Materials”) to be used by Advertiser in connection with the Sales Agency Services and Advertiser Services. illumin shall have the right to approve or reject the Marketing Materials in its sole discretion. Advertiser shall not make any representations, warranties, statements or claims about the Platform, except as approved by illumin in its sole discretion.

#### 4\. Obligations of parties

Advertiser hereby grants to illumin a worldwide, royalty free, sub-licensable, non-exclusive right and license to use, distribute, reproduce, publicly and digitally display and perform, transmit and broadcast (collectively, “Use”) the Ads (and any trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, URLs or other proprietary rights of Advertiser therein) in connection with the Campaign.

Advertiser represents and warrants to illumin that each Ad (and any and all content therein) and the distribution thereof in accordance with this Agreement:

4.1 complies, as applicable, with the Interactive Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less (US), and/or the IAB Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less and Late Creative Policy (Canada);

4.2 does not infringe the patents, copyrights, trademarks, rights of publicity, rights of privacy, moral rights, music performance or other music-related rights, or any other right of any third party;

4.3 does not violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation regarding the creation and marketing of online materials including, without limitation, those governing false and/or deceptive advertising;

4.4 is true, accurate and complete;

4.5 is not unlawful, defamatory or libelous;

4.6 is not pornographic or obscene; and

4.7 does not contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines.

4.8 Advertiser further represents and warrants that:

4.8.1 Prior to delivery to illumin, Advertiser will have obtained all consents, releases, waivers and rights (including, without limitation, all rights in copyright, moral rights, trade-mark and trade name rights and other intellectual property rights) necessary for the grant to illumin, and exploitation by illumin, of the rights and licenses granted to illumin in the Ads pursuant to this Agreement; illumin reserves, in its sole discretion, the right (but not the obligation) to: (i) review any Ads used by Advertiser through the Platform prior to Use; and/or (ii) to reject or refuse to serve any Ad that is, in its sole discretion, objectionable or which may expose illumin, its suppliers and each of their affiliates, or its other clients to any harm or liability of any type.

4.8.2 Advertiser has paid, or will have paid prior to use thereof, to the proper person, firm or corporation when due and payable, all residual, re-use or similar payments, all step-up fees, all music synchronization fees or royalties, all mechanical reproduction fees or royalties, all performance rights fees or royalties and all license payments and all other amounts payable to third parties as a result of, or in connection with, the Use of the Ads hereunder.

4.8.3 Advertiser represents and warrants that it is in compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“DAA OBA Principles”) and the Canadian Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“DAAC OBA Principles”), including the provision of appropriate notice and choice of online behavioral advertising. Advertiser represents and warrants that any websites where data is collected for online behavioral advertising provides users notice that third parties will collect data for purposes of serving targeted ads and provide a link to a means by which users may opt out of such targeted ads, such as www.aboutads.info or www.youradchoices.ca. For Advertiser’s convenience, we offer the following sample privacy disclosure, but strongly encourage Advertiser to work with counsel to ensure that these disclosures accurately represent Advertiser’s practices as legal requirements may change and/or be subject to differing legal interpretations: “We use a third-party service provider to serve ads and/or collect data on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this website.  They may collect information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services to tailor advertising messages on this website and other sites.  The information collected by these third-parties may include your devices IP address, user agent and other device level pseudonymous information. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to understand your choices about how to control how this information is used, please click here.”

4.9 illumin represents that in providing the Services, it shall adhere to applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable privacy law and Data Protection Laws and that the Platform shall operate as described in illumin’s privacy policy located [here](https://illumin.com/legal/corporate/). Notwithstanding the foregoing, illumin reserves the right to run campaigns on the platform of its choosing at its sole discretion.

#### 5\. Billing type

Advertiser agrees that it shall pay to illumin all amounts owing to illumin in accordance with the Billing Type selected by Advertiser in the Platform for a Campaign, and subject to the Monthly Minimum Commitment (as set forth in the IO), if any. For purposes of this Agreement:

“Dynamic Campaign” means that illumin will invoice Advertiser on a monthly basis for all Ad Inventory purchased by Advertiser pursuant to a Campaign, plus a percentage as set forth in the Platform.

“Fixed CPM Campaign” – means that illumin will invoice Advertiser on a monthly basis for the total number of impressions (per thousand) delivered pursuant to a Campaign at the rate for such impressions set forth by the Advertiser on the Platform.

#### 6\. Payment

illumin will invoice Advertiser monthly. Unless otherwise stated in the IO, Advertiser shall remit payment to the illumin within thirty (30) days of receipt of the applicable invoice. All late payments shall bear interest at the rate of 2% per month, or the highest rate allowable by law, whichever is lower. Advertiser agrees that it shall be solely liable for payment to illumin of all amounts owing pursuant to the terms hereof, and (if Advertiser is an agency or intermediary) it shall make all necessary payments hereunder, notwithstanding any non-payment to Advertiser by any third party.

In the event of default relating to the payment of any invoice, illumin shall have the right, without penalty or liability, to discontinue the performance of the Services. Furthermore, Advertiser agrees to pay all costs incurred by illumin in collecting any delinquent payments, including, but not limited to, collection agency and attorneys’ fees and costs.

#### 7\. Term

The term of this Agreement shall be as stated in the IO, unless earlier terminated by either party in accordance with the terms hereof.

#### 8\. Termination

8.4 For low activity as described herein: If Advertiser’s monthly spend is less than ten-thousand ($10,000) net per month for 3 consecutive months, illumin reserves the right to terminate the Agreement for low activity, without liability for such termination.

Upon termination of this Agreement and subject to Section 26: (i) Advertiser shall immediately discontinue use of the Platform, and all rights granted by illumin to Advertiser under this Agreement shall cease; (ii) Advertiser shall promptly pay to illumin all amounts properly due and owing to illumin hereunder.

Advertiser agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit a third party, during the Term of this Agreement or thereafter, directly or indirectly, to: (i) copy, alter, decompile, translate, disassemble, modify, reverse-compile, reverse engineer, redistribute, make any derivative use of, furnish, distribute, rent, sell, lease, lend, sublicense, give or otherwise transfer, permit access to or disclose the Intellectual Property, or any part thereof, or any interest therein, in any form to any other firm, person or entity without the express written consent of illumin; (ii) use the Intellectual Property: (A) for any illegal purpose or in a manner that violates any applicable law or regulation; or (B) in a manner that infringes the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights.

#### 12\. Publicity and content distribution

Advertiser agrees that part of the consideration being provided to illumin pursuant to this Agreement is the right for illumin to cite Advertiser from time to time on the illumin website, in presentations, speeches, press release and other media as a client of illumin.

#### 13\. Confidentiality

The parties acknowledge that, as a result of the provision of the Services, one party may disclose Confidential Information (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”). Therefore, the Receiving Party agrees that it will make no use (expect solely for purposes of this Agreement) or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information without obtaining the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent. Additionally, the Receiving Party will restrict disclosure of Confidential Information to its employee(s), authorized agent(s) and/or independent contractors to whom disclosure is reasonably required, and such employee(s), authorized agent(s) and/or independent contractor(s) shall be explicitly bound confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than as set forth herein, and will use reasonable care, but not less care than they use with respect to their own information of like character, to prevent disclosure of any Confidential Information. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring rights by license or otherwise in, or making any representations or warranties in respect of, any Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement (and each Party’s reliance on such Confidential Information is at its sole risk and responsibility.) This Section 13 shall survive any termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years thereafter. The Receiving Party agrees that monetary damages for breach of confidentiality under this Section 13 may not be adequate and that the Disclosing Party shall be further entitled to seek injunctive relief. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, confidentiality provisions shall not apply where the Receiving Party can demonstrate with clear evidence that the information: (a) was previously known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure, free of any obligation to keep it confidential; (b) became publicly known through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party; (c) was rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party who was not bound under any confidentiality provisions; or (d) was disclosed pursuant to judicial order, requirement of a governmental agency or by operation of law.

#### 14\. Indemnification

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the hiring of employees who respond to a generally advertised job opening shall not be considered a solicitation as contemplated by this clause.

#### 16\. Currency

#### Annex 2 Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter in accordance with Clauses 4(d) and 5(c) (or document/legislation)

Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter

Measures with which Personal Data can be processed while denying physical access to IT systems for unauthorized persons (access control):

All of the data exporter’s third-party data centers have strict policies for authorization of access into the facilities.   Each data center vendor has appropriate policies required by external audits.  All of the data exporter’s internal personnel are vetted prior to allowing access to data centers.

Measures to hinder unauthorized persons from using IT systems and procedures (access control):

All systems level access is based on directory services and role-based security.  Additional measures are in place such as VPN and other security measures prior to system level access being available, as described below.  All end user level access to illumin’s systems is based on role-based security.  Shared accounts are not allowed.

The data exporter undertakes the following actions, among others, to ensure that persons authorized to use the illumin Platform or access data processing infrastructure can only access the data underlying their access authorization and that stored data or data undergoing processing cannot be read, copied, altered, or removed without authorization.

The data exporter’s employees access infrastructure components with unique accounts that require strong passwords.  Remote administration is available only via public key cryptography and password-based authentication is not permitted.  Access groups have been established to restrict access to only to specific areas that are required for employee responsibilities.

Customers of the data exporter may be granted access to the illumin console. Access to the illumin console is limited via a username and a password to the customer’s authorized persons and additionally to equivalently authorized employees of the data exporter.  Logical infrastructure configuration prevents the access of one customer’s data by another customer.

Measures to enable persons authorized to use IT procedures to gain exclusive access to the Personal Data that are subject to their access authorization (access control):

The data exporter employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorized personnel. These mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information. The data exporter requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords; and carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform authorized tasks; a need-to-know basis; and must be in accordance with the data exporter’s internal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.

In addition, the data exporter has implemented several security related policies that govern the use of illumin technology and data including rules around acceptable use, data classification, information security, and passwords.  The data exporter’s information security officer is Rachel Kapcan.

Measures to ensure that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, amended or removed by unauthorized persons when the data is transmitted electronically, or when it is being transported, or when it is being stored on data carriers, but which allow checks to be made of the destinations targeted when transferring Personal Data using data transmission equipment (routing controls):

Data is encrypted by measures such as SSL.  Personal data shall not be transferred outside the scope as authorized under these Clauses, or as otherwise authorized by the data importer.

Measures that allow retrospective checks to be made on whether Personal Data has been entered into, amended or removed from IT systems, and by whom (input controls):

All data processed in illumin Platform by an end user of the platform (e.g., CL personnel) is done on a permissions-based model, all user accounts are enabled/disabled in accordance with the security policy.  All accounts are individual. Shared accounts are not allowed. Audit Trail is kept for user actions and is logged.

Email and corporate systems access is granted based on directory services and role-based security.

Measures to ensure that Personal Data to be processed on CONTROLLER’s behalf is only processed in accordance with CONTROLLER’s directives (performance controls):

The data importer is a user of the illumin Platform, therefore setting up of data collection mechanisms, collection of data, verifying data integrity sit with the data importer. The personal data shall only be processed in the manner authorized under these Clauses and all sub processors shall only be employed in compliance with the provisions of these Clauses.

Measures to ensure that Personal Data is protected against incidental damage or loss (availability controls):

Data is kept in a storage framework with at least three copies natively made and stored. Additionally, the data exporter replicates data between data centers for disaster recovery with ability to restore if needed, although the data exporter will not replicate lat/long or other data points which might be considered sensitive in the EU.

Measures to ensure that the different purposes for processing data can be identified – especially for PROCESSOR’s different controllers – and that data to be processed is processed separately from each other (separation controls):

illumin stores data in a multi-tenant environment on servers owned by illumin. The Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple data centers. illumin logically isolates data on a per end user basis at the application layer. illumin logically separates Customer’s data, including data from different end users, from each other, and data for an authenticated end user will not be displayed to another end user (unless the former end user or administrator allows the data to be shared). A central authentication system is used across all Services to increase uniform security of data.

Measures to ensure availability and resiliency for data and technical operations:

illumin stores data and operates servers in datacenters with robust and redundant power and data storage mechanisms. All deployments are configured with repeatable operating templates, for rapid deployment to a DR region when necessary. All networks are protected by network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other industry best practice security measures.

Measures for regular testing, assessment and evaluation:

illumin regularly reviews system activity rated by security threat level by our intrusion detection platform. illumin regularly runs external network scans to ensure operating systems, libraries, and all used software is patched against vulnerabilities. All platform configurations are catalogued within version control and issued via peer-reviewed pull requests to ensure multiple reviewers of each security related change.

Measures for pseudonymization of data:

illumin works with upstream data controllers to ensure no PII enters our system.

#### Annex III – Sub-processors

A list of Sub-processors will be made available by illumin.
