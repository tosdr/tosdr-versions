By continuing to use Yout or its services you agree to be bound by any future versions of these Terms of Service document. As such, we recommend that you review these Terms of Service from time to time.

Should you violate the Terms of Services, any prior authorization, implicit or explicit, to use Yout or its services shall terminate immediately without notice. Any use of Yout in violation of these Terms of Service shall be unauthorized.

No employer-employee relationship, partnership, or other agency relationship with Yout is created as a result of acceptance of these terms of service.

You represent and warrant to us that: (A) you are an individual (i.e., not a corporation) and you are of legal age to form a binding contract or have your parent’s permission to do so, and you are at least 13 years or age or older; (B) all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; and (C) you will maintain the accuracy of such information. You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the services and take full responsibility for the selection and use of and access to the services. This agreement is void where prohibited by law, and any access to Yout or its services in such jurisdictions is prohibited.

### Content

Yout retains the rights to any of its original content on Yout and its website.

Yout may collect information from your use of Yout and its services. For example, Yout collects your IP address for the rate limit recordings if you are not an UPGRADED user. This is the only instance where Yout logs your IP. There is no IP logging on any transcoders. It does not connect the IP it to any video that it recorded or audio. It simply tallies that a recording was done by that IP, till that IP reaches three requests. After one hour, your IP address expires. This is the only instance where Yout will use your IP an Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. Any and all other uses will be explicitly forbidden, as Yout does not log on any servers it uses. It may also collect information you provide in creating an account. Although you own your personal data and information, by and through your use of Yout and its services, you provide Yout the authorization and license to access, collect, and store such user data and information (“User Information”). Your User Information does not include any links you use.

You represent that you possess the right to provide Yout with your User Information. You also agree that all User Information you submit to Yout, expressly or through use of Yout and its services, will be collected and governed by Yout's Privacy Policy.

Yout uses certain icons for social media services (“Social Media Icons”) to direct users to information on Yout’s site about recording content from such social media services. The use of such icons does not reflect any endorsement of Yout or its services by such social media sites.

Apart from User Information provided by and collected from its users, Yout does not collect or store any third party content or information.

In using a link to third party content with Yout, you understand that you are completely responsible for the use of the link with Yout’s services. Yout is not responsible for any content accessible through such links or linked materials. You assume all responsibility.

As Yout does not store any links to third party content, via a configuration of youtube-dl and ffmpeg wrapped in a GoLang binary as [can be seen here](https://gist.github.com/nadermx/6bc255e79e8fd5c32a092750005b2d03) or similar software, all which does not bypass any DRM, and you will be supplying any link to use with Yout and its services, Yout cannot and does not review the content at such third-party sites. For obvious reasons, Yout does not endorse or assert any rights over such content. You understand that content and materials you may access through links submitted to Yout and its services may not be factual, complete, or current.

Certain content may contain digital rights mechanisms that prevent access or storage of such content. You agree not to attempt circumvention of such digital rights mechanisms.

You use any links as your own discretion and risk. You understand.

Any graphics, designs, logos, icons, codes, or other content remain the intellectual property of their respective owners and are protected under applicable copyright, trademark, and/or other intellectual property laws. You may not use any of this content without permission (if you have any questions about the use of Yout's intellectual property, please [contact us](https://yout.com/contact/) we'd love to help).

Yout respects the intellectual property rights of others, and does not permit or condone copyright infringing activities, which is why the service is solely allowing to record publicly available online-content.

Again, Yout does not store any third-party content accessed through its services or website. As such, we cannot remove any content. Should you wish to remove or disable access to content available through other websites, please direct any notice to the hosting provider (e.g. YouTube, FaceBook, Twitch, etc.) directly. You may contact some of them via the following links: [YouTube takedown](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622?hl=en), [FaceBook takedown](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/634636770043106).

### Conduct

**Yout and its services must only be used for personal, non-commercial use.** Any commercial use of Yout is strictly forbidden. Yout seeks solely to enable a user to create a copy of accessible online-content through the use of its services in the form of a video recorder for the private, non-commercial use of the user ("fair use"). However, this does not include publishing the recorded video on any public platform without express authorization of the owner. Any use of third-party content must be authorized by the owner of such content and its intellectual property. The user bears full responsibility for their use of Yout. Yout only acts as a technical service provider.

Further. you agree not to:

* Violate any laws in your jurisdiction, including any anti-piracy laws.
* Impersonate any third party or parties.
* Disrupt the activities of other Yout users.

Any violation of these Terms of Services and rights of any party may result in civil or criminal penalties pursued by Yout or other third parties.
