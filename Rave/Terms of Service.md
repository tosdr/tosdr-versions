**General**

You agree to use the Website in strict compliance with all applicable laws, rules, rulings and regulations and in a fashion that does not, in the sole judgment of Rave Mobile Safety, negatively reflect on the goodwill or reputation of Rave Mobile Safety and shall take no actions that would cause Rave Mobile Safety to be in violation of any laws, rules, rulings or regulations applicable to Rave Mobile Safety. Rave Mobile Safety and the Website are based in the United States. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without reference to the principles of conflicts of law of that state or any other jurisdiction. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the courts of the United States located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceedings in such courts for all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Website. You agree that all claims you may have against Rave Mobile Safety arising from or relating to the Website must be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived. Use of the Website is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement, including, without limitation, this paragraph. If any part of the Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions in the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

The Agreement (and any other terms and conditions referenced herein) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Rave Mobile Safety with respect to the Website and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between the User and Rave Mobile Safety with respect to the Website. A printed version of the Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
