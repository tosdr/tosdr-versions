The Department of Justice provides these links and pointers solely for your information and convenience. When you select a link to an outside website, you are subject to the privacy, copyright, security, and information quality policies of that website. The Department of Justice:

1. DOES NOT control or guarantee the accuracy, legality, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on a linked website;

Linking to the DOJ Website
--------------------------

Links to the Department of Justice website are permitted. The use of Department of Justice seals, however, is protected and requires advance written authorization as described below. The fact that a website links to the Department of Justice site does not indicate that the Department has any responsibility for the content of that site, nor does it constitute an endorsement of that site by the Department.

Copyright Status and Citation
-----------------------------

Unless otherwise indicated, information on Department of Justice websites is in the public domain and may be copied and distributed without permission. Citation of the Department of Justice as source of the information is appreciated, as appropriate. The use of any Department of Justice seals, however, is protected and requires advance authorization, as described below.

If a source other than the Department of Justice or other federal government agency is indicated on a photo, graphic, or other material, permission to copy these materials must be obtained from the original source. Please note that some photos, graphics and other materials used on this website are copyrighted. For information on materials generated by external entities with Department of Justice funding, please refer to individual component policies. This copyright notice only pertains to the Department of Justice website.

Use of Department of Justice and Component Seals, Logos, Other Official Insignia, Names and Initials
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Department of Justice seals, logos and other official insignia may not be used or reproduced without written permission. Requests for permission to use or reproduce any seal, logo, or other official insignia of a component of the Department of Justice shall be referred to the heads of the relevant component. Requests for permission to use or reproduce any Department seal or other official insignia shall be referred to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration. Permission to use or reproduce seals, logos or other official insignia of the Department is granted on a case-by-case basis and involves the consideration of many relevant factors, including: the cost or benefit to the Department or the government of granting the request; the unintended appearance of endorsement or authentication by the Department; the potential for misuse; the effect on Department security; the reputability of the use; and the extent of control by the Department over the ultimate use and distribution of any product(s) or publication(s) bearing official insignia of the Department.

The use of the names or initials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the United States Marshals Service is governed by 18 U.S.C. sec. 709, which prohibits their unauthorized use in a manner calculated to convey the impression that such use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by that component, unless written permission has been received from the head of the respective component.

Information Quality Guidelines
------------------------------

The Department of Justice has issued guidelines to help ensure the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of the information it disseminates to the public, including the information provided on this website. The Department’s information quality practices and procedures can be found on [DOJ's Information Quality page](https://www.justice.gov/information-quality "Information Quality"). The Department’s information quality guidelines include procedures for requesting corrections of disseminated information. The Department will make every effort to correct errors brought to our attention.
