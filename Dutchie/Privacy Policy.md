This Policy covers the following categories of data subjects:

* **Dispensaries:** Dispensaries are cannabis retailers that have contracted with Dutchie for use of Dutchie's Services or have expressed an interest in using Dutchie's Services.

Unless a data subject interacts with Dutchie directly (for example, if a prospective Dispensary customer submits their Personal Information to Dutchie in order to schedule a demo of the Service, or if a Customer places an order at a Dispensary through our website), Dutchie only processes Personal Information on behalf of and at the direction of our Dispensary customers, who are responsible for addressing any privacy requests from their Customers and other applicable data subjects.

We refer to that Personal Information as "Merchant Data" in our agreements with our Dispensary customers. We process the Merchant Data under our Dispensary customers' instructions and in accordance with our agreements with our Dispensary customers, which requires us to use the Merchant Data for the strict purpose of providing the Services to the corresponding Dispensary or as otherwise expressly set forth in the agreement. Dispensaries are responsible for the Personal Information they collect through use of the Services, complying with any applicable privacy requirements and fulfilling Customer requests with respect to their Personal Information.

Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with your Dutchie account, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area.

**4\. RETENTION**

We retain Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services and carry out the purposes described in this Policy. If necessary, we may retain Personal Information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, or for instances where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements.

To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations.

Once retention of the Personal Information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the Personal Information or, if this is not possible (for example, because Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the Personal Information and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.

**5\. DE-IDENTIFIED INFORMATION**

We may at times receive or process Personal Information to create deidentified information that can no longer reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular data subject. Where we maintain deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the information, except as required by law.

**6\. CHILDREN**

Our Services are not directed to children who are under the age of 18 or adults under the minimum age of possession of cannabis in their jurisdiction. Dutchie does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18 or adults under the minimum age of possession of cannabis. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 or adults under the minimum age of possession of cannabis has provided Personal Information to Dutchie through the Service please [contact us](#contact-us) and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**7\. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**

The Services may contain links to other websites and services not operated or controlled by Dutchie, including Dispensaries and social media services ("**Third Party Services**").

We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect Personal Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Services or e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to Dutchie via the Internet. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services, or Third Party Services.

The VCDPA affords eligible data subjects with certain individual rights with respect to Personal Information that we have collected, subject to certain limitations, including:

* **Right of Access:** You have the right to confirm whether a controller is processing your Personal Information and to access such information.
    
* **Right of Correction:** You have the right to correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, taking into account the nature of the Personal Information and purposes of the processing.
    
* **Right of Deletion:** You have the right to delete your Personal Information you have provided or that has been collected.
    
* **Right of Portability:** You have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Information that was previously provided in a portable, and to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that can be transmitted to another controller where the processing is carried out by automated means.
    
* **Right to Opt Out:** You have the right to opt out of (a) targeted advertising, (b) the sale of Personal Information, and (c) profiling in furtherance of decisions that product legal or similarly significant effects. Note, however, that Dutchie does not sell your Personal Information.
    

Dutchie has established an individual rights portal for the purposes of submitting such individual rights requests, which can be found [here](https://privacy.dutchie.com/). You may also submit requests via email to [privacy@dutchie.com](mailto:privacy@dutchie.com).

Once an individual rights request has been submitted, Dutchie may ask you for additional information in order to verify your identity or to provide additional details to help us respond to your request. This may include your name, email address, phone number or other details related to your use of the Services. Where applicable, these requests can be submitted by an authorized agent through the channels described above in accordance with the applicable law. These include requests made on behalf of a minor by the individual's parent or legal guardian can also be made via the individual rights portal above. In these cases, in order to verify the authorized agent's authority, we generally require evidence of that individual's authority to act on behalf of the individual. All individual rights requests will be managed in accordance with the requirements set out in the VCDPA.

Please note that in certain circumstances, we may refuse to act or impose limitations on your rights, as permitted by the applicable law. In the event we decline to take action on a request, we will notify you within 45 days of receipt of the original request with our justification for declining to take action and how you may appeal that decision (including an overview of the appeals process and how you can initiate an appeal).

**1\. CONSENT**

By using our Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Statement and consent to the collection, use, processing, disclosure and retention of your Personal information as described in the Privacy Policy. Typically, we will provide notice of the purpose for collecting your Personal Information and/or seek your consent (which may be express or implied, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information) in line with applicable law at the time that we collect your Personal information. In general, you may change or withdraw your consent at any time subject to legal or contractual obligations and by providing reasonable notice. Your withdrawal of consent may impact the ability of Dutchie to provide you with some or all of the Services. Upon receiving notice that you would like to withdraw your consent, we will inform you of the likely consequences of your withdrawal of consent.

Dutchie will not collect, use, or disclose your Personal Information except for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise identified at the time of collection, unless we have received your consent (which may be express or implied, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information) or the processing is authorized without consent.

**2\. ACCESSING AND CORRECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You may have the right to request access to and to correct the Personal Information that we hold about you, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Subject to applicable law and your relationship with us, this may include a right to review, correct, update, suppress, delete or otherwise limit our use of your Personal Information that has been previously provided to us. You may also have the right to access information about the ways in which your Personal Information is or has been used and the names of individuals and/or organizations to which your information has been disclosed.

Dutchie has established an individual rights portal for the purposes of submitting such individual rights requests, which can be found [here](https://privacy.dutchie.com/). You may also submit requests via email to [privacy@dutchie.com](mailto:privacy@dutchie.com).

We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably practicable, and within the time period required by law. You will not be charged to exercise these rights. Once an individual rights request has been submitted, Dutchie may ask you for additional information in order to verify your identity or to provide additional details to help us respond to your request. This may include your name, email address, phone number or other details related to your use of Dutchie's Services.

If we correct your information, we will also send the corrected information to organizations to which we disclosed the information during the year before the date the correction was made.

Please note that in certain circumstances, we may refuse to act or impose limitations on your rights, as permitted by applicable law. If we cannot provide you with access to your Personal Information or are unable to correct your Personal Information, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal restrictions, and outline further steps available to you. If we refuse to act on a request to correct your Personal Information, we will nonetheless annotate the information, noting the correction that was requested but not made.

In certain cases, depending on the nature of your request, there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which, due to applicable law or as part of Services that are in the process of being carried out, will not be removed or changed. We will also retain information relating to your request for recordkeeping and compliance purposes.

**3\. TRANSFERS**

We may process, store, and transfer your Personal Information in and to a foreign country, with different privacy laws that may or may not be as comprehensive as Canadian law, including the United States. In these circumstances, the governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country may be able to obtain access to your personal information through the laws of the foreign country. When you provide Personal Information to us through the Services, you consent to the transfer and processing of your Personal Information in this manner. Any international transfers made will be in accordance with applicable law.

We also impose appropriate safeguards for the transfer of Personal Information among our affiliates and to third-party service providers in various jurisdictions, and have implemented appropriate contractual arrangements or other measures for such purposes.
