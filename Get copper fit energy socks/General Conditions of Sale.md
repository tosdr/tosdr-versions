Under our Zero Tolerance Policy, Ideavillage Products Corp. ("Ideavillage") is aggressively pursuing counterfeiters that are manufacturing and/or selling counterfeit products. As we continue to take steps to protect our consumers, we also encourage them to be diligent when purchasing Ideavillage products and look for telltale signs of counterfeits - such as spelling errors on the packaging, improper use of product names, low-quality packaging, unusually low prices, and any other details that seem suspicious. Additionally, given that Ideavillage does not ship orders from China, any products that have been shipped directly from China are counterfeit. We strongly recommend that consumers only purchase Ideavillage products from Ideavillage's websites.
