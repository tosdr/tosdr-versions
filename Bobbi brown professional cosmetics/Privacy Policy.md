To enroll in our Brand loyalty programs, you are required to provide your email address and to create a password. You may also provide us with your name, mailing address, birth month/date and mobile phone number, but this information is optional. Once you enroll in the Brand loyalty program, we also will collect information about purchases you may make.

You can join (opt-in to) Brand loyalty programs and find program details, terms and conditions on our participating Brand websites. You may withdraw (opt-out) from receiving such financial incentives at any time by deactivating your loyalty program account(s). To deactivate your loyalty program account(s), visit the specific Brand website of the loyalty program you wish to deactivate and provide your identifying information as requested.

If you exercise your right to request deletion of your personal information, it will be impossible for us to continue providing loyalty program benefits to you because we will no longer have the information required to provide you with certain benefits (such as information about qualifying purchases).
