    Reviews on Vendor profiles:

    You can report a review as being false to WedMeGood for Verification at [reviews@wedmegood.com](mailto:reviews@wedmegood.com) or [info@wedmegood.com](mailto:info@wedmegood.com).  
    WedMeGood team will contact the Vendor within 48 hours and ask to submit them aforementioned proof for the review. The verification case will be closed if the vendor fails to submit the proof within 7 days after being contacted.  
    a) If WedMeGood receives appropriate and satisfactory proof - The review will be removed from the vendor profile within 1 week, after notification to the vendor & the reviewer.  
    Note that WedMeGood cannot & does not verify and confirm to every statement written in the reviews on vendor profiles.

    WedMeGood prides itself in ensuring authentic and genuine reviews that can help engaged couples make better hiring decisions. As a platform committed to showcasing honest reviews, we request our vendors to abide by the following guidelines.  
    The Vendor can ask their clients to review their Profile on WedMeGood and share their profile link with them & ask them to write a review, or, could simply ask them to share their review & rating with us on [info@wedmegood.com](mailto:info@wedmegood.com) & we will get the review uploaded on their behalf.  
    The best way to get positive reviews is by delighting your clients. Selective solicitation is a strict NO. Offering any type of compensation, getting your family/relatives/team members to write a review for you is completely unacceptable & such reviews would be removed without any intimation  
    Whether you agree with the feedback or not, we recommend you take the criticism in good stride. In cases of a negative review, we strongly suggest you reply to the review with your side of the story as it shows that you care. From our statistics, we have seen that users read both sides of the story and take an impartial call while reading reviews. Moreover, some of the most popular and booked vendors on WedMeGood have also received negative reviews on their profiles so you don't need to worry.Also, another way to mitigate the impact would be to get more positive reviews on your profile so that the negative review is pushed down & your average rating is improved.

    WedMeGood does not permit or facilitate account deletions of Vendors, once made. The account may be marked as unclaimed and be made unsearchable upon the platform’s discretion Vendor’s request.  
    Please note, a vendor’s profile may be created even without their prior consent. One such method of this is creating a profile with the users submitting reviews of vendors who don’t have an active, listed profile on Wedmegood yet  
    As a trustworthy aggregator of wedding info and data, WedMeGood showcases this info; However in an unclaimed/ unverified state due to absence of complete details.
