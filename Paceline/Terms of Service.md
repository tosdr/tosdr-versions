**Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver**.

Please read the following (this “Provision”) carefully.  It affects your rights.

Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to a user’s satisfaction by contacting us at our support page.  This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Company.  Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.  You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.

Please read this Provision carefully.  It provides that all Disputes between you and Company shall be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration replaces the right to go to court.  In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).  Except as otherwise provided, entering into these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).

For the purpose of this Provision, “Company” means Company and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.  The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Company regarding, arising out of or relating to any aspect of your relationship with Company, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable cause of action or claim for relief, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).  “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Company’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.

WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution

For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Company an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.  You must commence this process by mailing written notification to TAM(Squared) Inc., 595 Pacific Avenue, 5th Floor, San Francisco, California 94111, Attn: Chief Executive Officer. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.  If Company does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.  You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.

Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out

Notwithstanding the above, you or Company may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).  You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to TAM(Squared) Inc., 595 Pacific Avenue, 5th Floor, San Francisco, California 94111, Attn: Chief Executive Officer.  Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Company through arbitration.  Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Company.  Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.

Arbitration Procedures

If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Company may initiate arbitration proceedings.  The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration only, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.

For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.  In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.  The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.  The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.  Under no circumstances will class action or representative action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.

Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.  However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.

Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other applicable law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

Location of Arbitration – You or Company may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco County, California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.

Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – Company will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing fees and any arbitrator’s hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your written request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary hearing in the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.  Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.  In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Company as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.

Class Action Waiver

Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, representative action, or private attorney general action) unless both you and Company specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the arbitration.  If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.  Neither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.

Jury Waiver

You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms you and Company are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.  In the absence of this Provision, you and Company might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).  Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.  Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.

Severability

If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect.  If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.

Continuation

This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Company or its affiliates.  Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, the parties agree that if Company makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change and require Company to adhere to the present language in this Provision if a dispute between the parties arises.

**Termination**.

You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time by removing the Mobile Application from your mobile device.  In addition, you may delete your account and terminate these Terms by emailing Company at our Support page.

The Company may at any time, in its sole discretion, terminate these Terms, or suspend or terminate your account for any reason.

1. Paceline Cardholders earn 1.5% cash back on qualifying purchases and 2.5% on qualifying Health & Wellness purchases. Achieving your weekly Paceline Streak will double your cash back for that week to 3% and 5% respectively. See your Paceline Rewards Program Terms Agreement for explanation and details about the Paceline Streak. See Paceline Cash Rewards Program Terms and Conditions for additional [details](https://paceline.fit/legal/paceline-cash-rewards-program-terms-and-conditions/). A qualifying Health & Wellness purchase is based on merchant category codes (MCC), and in the case of merchant specific rewards, on the merchant name provided to us, by the merchant’s credit card processor. Purchases made through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, mobile or digital wallets or similar technology may not be eligible for Health & Wellness rewards. Paceline makes every effort to include all relevant merchants in its Health & Wellness rewards categories. However, some merchants may not be classified in a particular category based on their classification with their credit card processor. If this occurs, purchases with that merchant will not qualify for Health & Wellness rewards.
2. Get the latest Apple Watch! Earn up to a total of $429 in weekly statement credits over the course of 12 months. In order to qualify for reimbursement each week, you must: (1) maintain your Card Account status in good standing; and (2) achieve your Paceline activity goal as defined in your Paceline account documents. Neither Apple nor Evolve Bank & Trust are participants or sponsors of this program. Neither Apple nor Evolve Bank & Trust warrants this offer.
