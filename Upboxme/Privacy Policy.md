=================

##### Updated on 15/06/2022

Scope of The Agreement
----------------------

Thanks for using UpBox.me! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our websites, software, and services (‚ÄúServices‚Äù).

What & Why
----------

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.

_Account information._ We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).

_Your Stuff._ Our Services are designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (‚ÄúYour Stuff‚Äù), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it. This related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.

_Usage information._ We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders). We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and protect UpBox.me users. Please refer to our FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information.

_Device information._ We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.

_Cookies and other technologies._ We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. We may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote UpBox.me services.

_Marketing._ We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you don‚Äôt want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the ‚Äòunsubscribe‚Äô link in the corresponding emails, or update your preferences in the Notifications section of your personal account.

We sometimes contact people who don‚Äôt have a UpBox.me account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before reaching out. If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by UpBox.me, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.

Bases for processing your data. We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent.

With Whom
---------

We may share information as discussed below, but we won‚Äôt sell it to advertisers or other third parties.

Others working for and with UpBox.me. UpBox.me uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) for the business purposes of helping us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we‚Äôll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions. For a list of trusted third parties that we use to process your personal data and more details on the categories of personal information that we‚Äôve disclosed, please see our FAQ.

Other users. Our Services are designed to help you collaborate with others. If you register your UpBox.me account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, join a UpBox.me Business Team, or collaborate with other UpBox.me users, we may suggest you or your team as a potential collaborator to other users or teams. For example, if you interact with a person at a company, and that person frequently works with one of their coworkers, we may suggest you as a potential collaborator for that coworker. Collaborators and potential collaborators may see some of your basic information, like your name, UpBox.me Business Team name, profile picture, device, email address, and usage information. This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.

Certain features let you make additional information available to others.

Law & Order and the Public Interest. We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of UpBox.me or our users; (d) protect UpBox.me‚Äôs rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that your data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it‚Äôs stored on our Services or on your home computer‚Äôs hard drive. We‚Äôll abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for your data:

Be transparent Fight blanket requests Protect all users, and Provide trusted services. We publish a Transparency Report as part of our commitment to informing you about when and how governments ask us for information. This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement. We encourage you to review our Government Request Principles and Transparency Report for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.

How
---

Security. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account. We deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users.

User Controls. You can access, amend, download, and delete your personal information by logging into your UpBox.me account and going to your account settings page. Learn more here about managing your account information generally, or click here to learn how to change your profile information.

EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.

UpBox.me has certified to the Department of Commerce that it, and its subsidiary JN Projects Inc. d/b/a HelloSign, adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. You can also learn more about Privacy Shield at https://www.privacyshield.gov.
