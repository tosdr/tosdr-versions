DriveSure.com - Website Privacy Policy
======================================

**Effective date: March 3, 2021**

This Privacy Policy applies to information about you that Krex, Inc. (“DriveSure”, “we”, “our”, “us”) may obtain when you visit DriveSure.com or KrexInc.com (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect, use, or share information about you; your choices regarding our use of your information; how we safeguard such information; and how you may contact us regarding our privacy practices.

###### Collection of personal information

**Information you provide.** We may obtain information that you provide directly to us when you interact with the Site (e.g., when you schedule a consultation, create an account, update your profile or vehicle registration, comment on a blog post, fill out a contact form, manage your customers, initiate enrollment of vehicle owners, submit claims, verify vehicle coverage, or request sales resources or reports). This information may include personal information, which is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, email address, phone number, company affiliation, and vehicle information.

If you submit to us someone else’s personal information (e.g., their name and contact information), you represent that you have the authorization to provide this information to us.

**Information collected automatically.** We use various tools and technologies like cookies and web server logs to collect information automatically on the Site. This information may include IP addresses, device identifiers, browser characteristics, operating system details, internet service provider details, language preferences, referring URLs, time and length of visits, and pages viewed.

“Cookies” are small data files stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies may allow a website to recognize a user’s device, record user preferences, track the pages a user clicks on while visiting the website, and identify the website visited immediately beforehand. Most web browsers accept cookies by default, but you may be able to adjust your browser settings to remove or reject cookies. Please note that blocking cookies may affect the availability and functionality of this Site and other websites. Also, disabling cookies may invalidate opt outs that use cookies to recognize devices that have opted out.

We may combine certain automatically collected information with other information we obtain about you, which may include data we obtain from third parties.

Please note that we or third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different devices and online properties when you use the Site.

Your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal when you visit various websites or use online services. Like many websites, the Site is not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers. To learn more about “Do Not Track” signals, visit [www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

**Information collected from other parties.** Our vendors may share with us your personal information that you submit to them. For example, if you apply for a job using [our career portal](https://drivesure.com/careers/#op), you may submit personal information to one or more of our service providers that may share your information with us. Additionally, our dealership customers may share your personal information with us when you purchase a vehicle or otherwise request vehicle servicing. We may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from other parties. When you submit information to another party, you are subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policies, for which we are not responsible.

**Information relating to children.** We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children as defined by local law.  If we learn that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete it or otherwise comply with applicable law.

###### Use of personal information

###### Sharing of personal information

We may share your personal information with our business partners and vendors that provide services on our behalf.

We also may share data in a manner that does not identify you (for example, information that has been aggregated with other records) for general business purposes. For example, we may disclose the number of visitors to the Site.

In the event of a business transaction, such as if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (e.g., further to a merger, reorganization, liquidation, or any other business transaction, including negotiations of such transactions), we reserve the right to disclose any information we obtain through the Site.

Additionally, DriveSure may disclose personal information when required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal processes; in response to activities that are unlawful or a violation of DriveSure’s rules for use of the Site; or to protect and defend our rights or property.

###### Analytics and advertising

Our vendors, including Google, may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to collect or receive information about your internet usage, including your use of this Site, and use that information to provide website statistics and to target ads. We and our vendors may use first-party cookies or other first-party identifiers as well as third-party cookies or other third-party identifiers to deliver advertisements, create a profile of you, measure your interests, detect your demographics, detect your location, and personalize content.

We may use certain web analytics services, including Google Analytics, to help us understand and analyze how visitors use the Site and to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. We’ve implemented Google Analytics Advertising Features such as remarketing with analytics, interest-based advertising, demographics and interests reporting, user segment analysis, and impression reporting. For more information on how Google Analytics uses data collected through the Site, visit [policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
