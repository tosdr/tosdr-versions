4. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
    
    **Privacy Rights if you are located in the EEA or your Personal Information is held by a Warner Music Company in the EEA**:
    
    By law, you have a number of rights (subject to certain conditions and exceptions) when it comes to your information. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at [privacypolicy@wmg.com](mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com) or through our details in the contact section below.
    
    **You have the right to object to us using your Personal Information where we rely on “legitimate interests” as a lawful basis for processing your Personal Information or where we use your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes (.e. if you no longer want to receive direct marketing newsletters, updates and other marketing communications from us).**
    
    | Rights | What does this mean? |
    | --- | --- |
    | The right to be informed | You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your Personal Information and your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this Privacy Policy. |
    | The right of access | You have the right to obtain access to your Personal Information (if we are processing it), and certain other information (like the information provided in this Privacy Policy).<br><br>This is so you are aware and can check that we are using your Personal Information in accordance with data protection law. |
    | The right to rectification | You are entitled to have your Personal Information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. |
    | The right to erasure | This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your Personal Information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions. |
    | The right to restrict processing | You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your Personal Information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your Personal information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their Personal Information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future. |
    | The right to data portability | You have the right to receive your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to request that this data is transmitted to another controller where this is technically feasible. This right only applies to Personal Information you have provided to us yourself (not any other information), that we process by automated means based on your consent or for the performance of a contract with you. |
    | The right to object | You have the right to object to the use of your Personal Information in some circumstances, such as where we don’t have to process your Personal Information to meet a contractual or other legal obligation. For example, you may object to the use of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. We can still store your Personal Information, but we can no longer use it in the way that you have asked us not to. |
    | The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling | You have the right not to have your Personal Information used to make solely automated decisions about you that you impact you. For example, you have the right not to have your Personal Information used to create a profile of you that automated decisions are later based on without there being any human involvement in that processing. |
    | The right to lodge a complaint | You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your Personal Information with your relevant national data protection regulator. See details of the EEA data protection regulators [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-are-data-protection-authorities-dpas_en). |
    | The right to withdraw consent | If you have given your consent to anything we do with your Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your Personal Information with your consent up to that point is unlawful). This includes the right to withdraw consent to us using your Personal Information for marketing purposes. |
