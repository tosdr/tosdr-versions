10\. Additional Information for Users in Certain U.S. Jurisdictions

_This section only applies to residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Residents of these U.S. states are afforded additional rights in accordance with their respective state data privacy laws. It describes how we collect, use, and share personal information in operating our business as well as your individual rights with respect to your personal information._

We may collect the following categories of personal information about you:

_**Identifiers**_ (e.g., device identifier, IP address, unique browser ID, cookies, beacons, pixel tags, account login, other unique identifiers, name, site log-in, email address, mailing address (or state / province and country of residence), phone number, images of yourself you provide us for your account page you are creating and completing in order to attend an event we are hosting.

The sources from which we collect information and additional details on the information we collect are described in [Section 1](#1.%20Information%20Collected) of this policy; the business and commercial purposes for which we collect this information are described in [Section 2](#2.%20How%20We%20Use%20Your%20Information) of this policy; and the ways in which we may share this information are described in [Section 3](#3.%20How%20We%20Share%20Your%20Information) of this policy.

**Your Privacy Rights and How to Exercise Them** As a California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia resident, you have certain rights related to your personal information, which are detailed below. We encourage you to invoke these rights if you wish. Rest assured that we will not discriminate or retaliate against you for doing so.

Except where otherwise noted, you can exercise these rights by visiting our [Help Center](https://support.theatlantic.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360002309013) or by contacting us at privacy@theatlantic.com. If you opt to email us, please include as detailed a description of your request as possible.

Upon receiving certain types of requests, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can move forward. Typically this will involve asking you to confirm information we already have on file about you. We will never ask you for sensitive information such as your credit card, driver’s license, or social security numbers for verification purposes.

You may also allow an “authorized agent” to submit a request on your behalf through the same means outlined above. Unless your agent has been given power of attorney, we will additionally need the following items to honor your request:  (1) written authorization, signed by you, allowing them to act on your behalf; (2) proof of your identity; and (3) direct confirmation sent from you to us (without the authorized agent as an intermediary) affirming that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.

Types of Rights

* **_Access_** This policy describes the categories of personal information we may collect about you, and how that information is collected, used, and disclosed. We will also provide you with the specific pieces of personal information we hold about you upon your request. Oregon residents may also request to know the specific third parties to whom your personal information has been disclosed.
    
* **_Correction_** If you believe that any of the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate you may request that we correct it. You can update some information, like your contact details, yourself by visiting your account page. For other corrections, please contact  us as described above.
    
* **_Deletion_** You may request that we delete the personal information we hold about you. We fulfill these requests by erasing the data or by anonymizing it such that you can no longer be identified. We will not attempt to re-identify anonymized data. Please note that we may need to retain limited amounts of personal information after completing your request for legal compliance purposes. Additionally, we may postpone completion of your request when your personal information is necessary to fulfill our obligations to you. For example, if you are an active subscriber we may wait until your subscription expires before fulfilling your request.
    
* **_Right to Withdraw Consent for or Limit the Use and Disclosure of Your Sensitive Personal Information_** When you participate in one of our surveys, we may ask you about information that could be considered sensitive under applicable privacy laws. The question will always be optional, but you also have the option to withdraw your consent to our use of this information or to limit our right to use or disclose your sensitive personal information after you’ve provided it to us. If you do so, we will delete it entirely; only use it as necessary to provide our Services to you; or as otherwise permitted by law. To opt-out, you can visit our [data opt-out page](https://www.theatlantic.com/do-not-sell-my-personal-information/) or email us at privacy@theatlantic.com.
    
* **_Opt out of “Selling,”Sharing, or Using for Targeted Advertising_ Y**ou have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information, or the sharing/use of it for targeted advertising. Under some of these state laws, the word “sale” means our disclosure of your personal information to a third party in exchange for money or any other thing of value, while others only consider it a “sale” if money was exchanged. For the purposes of this policy, when we say “sale,” “selling,” or “sold,” we mean in the broader sense: the exchange of personal information for money or any other thing of value. However, “selling” does not encompass disclosing your personal information to a third party for other purposes, such as those that enable us to provide our Services. We do not sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e.,  for money), but may disclose certain details to our business partners and underwriters.  
      
    Sharing or using your personal information for targeted advertising means our disclosure of your personal information to a third party in order to serve you interest-based advertisements. Likewise, it does not encompass disclosing your personal information to a third party for other purposes.  
      
    To opt out of one or both of these practices, please visit [our data opt-out page](https://www.theatlantic.com/do-not-sell-my-personal-information/). You may also opt out by enabling a legally-recognized, opt-out preference signal (such as the Global Privacy Control) on your device. Please review [Section 5](https://www.theatlantic.com/privacy-policy/#5.%20Privacy%20Choices%20Regarding%20Personalized%20Advertisements) above for more information on how to enable these signals. We recognize the signal on an account level, so your opt out request will be applied across your devices as long as you are logged into your Atlantic account. Please note that after opting out you will continue to see non-targeted advertisements on our Services.  
      
    Additionally, when residents of California opt out of “sales,” we also treat your request as one made pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to opt out of  the disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their use for direct marketing.
    

If your request related to any of the rights detailed above  is denied, you may appeal that decision by emailing us at privacy@theatlantic.com.

**Information We Disclose To Third Parties**

The chart below details the categories of (1) personal data we disclose to third parties, (2) third parties we disclose that information to for a business purpose, and (3) third parties we “sell” or share it with for targeted advertising. It reflects these practices over the 12 months prior to the day this policy was last updated. As a reminder, our service providers enable us to deliver our Services to you. For example, we use service providers to process your payments, to manage our email communications with you, and to maintain our Services’ safety and security. Please note that the lists below are likely to be overbroad for any single person. Similarly, not every data point that falls into the categories below is necessarily shared with all of the third parties listed. For more information on the categories used in the following chart and the reasons why we share personal data, please review [Section 1](#1.%20Information%20Collected) and [Section 3](#3.%20How%20We%20Share%20Your%20Information) of this policy, respectively.

**Additional Information for California Residents**

The following information applies to California residents only.

Notice Regarding Financial Incentives for California Residents - From time to time, we may offer the opportunity to participate in user research surveys, which may be emailed to you directly or publicized on our social media accounts. As a part of these surveys we may collect Personal Information, including but not limited to demographic information and information about your experiences with our Services. We use this information to help us gain further insight into and to improve our Services. In some instances, participation in a survey may make you eligible to win prizes, e.g, gift cards, in a sweepstakes. Under California law, this may be considered a financial incentive in exchange for Personal Information. We may also occasionally contact you about other opportunities to earn gifts or prizes from us. These too may be considered a financial incentive in exchange for Personal Information under California law. The value of a given gift or prize is reasonably related to the value of the information provided. We assess the value of your Personal Information by considering, without limitation, details such as the cost to us of providing you with the gift or prize, the potential revenue or improvements to the Services made possible by the direct or indirect use of the information.

Participation in any survey is voluntary. You may opt out of receiving surveys from us by emailing research@theatlantic.com. For more information regarding a sweepstakes linked to a particular survey, please refer to that sweepstakes’ official rules.

Notice Regarding California Residents We Know to Be Under the Age of 16 - California residents we know to be younger than 16 years of age will by default be treated as though they have exercised a request to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information with respect to information provided directly to us (as opposed to information automatically collected from them through technical means). We do not permit such users to opt-in to the sale or sharing of their Personal Information, unless they provide proof that they are no longer under the age of 16. To do so, please email us at privacy@theatlantic.com.
