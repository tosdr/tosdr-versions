You are responsible for updating a new payment method if your payment method expires prior to the renewal date. Payment method updates may be done on your account page. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Privado makes no representations or warranties about the continued availability of any form of payment method made available for use with the Services. We reserve the right to add and remove payment methods at any point in time.

  

### Termination by Privado

If you are a user of the free Services, you agree that Privado, in its sole discretion, for any or no reason, may terminate your account or your use of the Services at any point in time and for any reason. If you paid for premium Services or a subscription and your account is terminated during a period for which you are a paid subscriber, you may be entitled to a pro-rated refund of your current subscription payment amount in connection with your use of the premium or subscription Services. If your account is terminated due to a breach of these Terms, you will not be entitled to any refund whatsoever.
