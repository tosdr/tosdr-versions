Refund policy
=============

Returns  
Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.

Refunds (if applicable)  
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.  
If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

Late or missing refunds (if applicable)  
If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.  
Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.  
Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.  
If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at artnindia@gmail.com.

Shipping  
If you need to exchange it for a similar item or return your product, send us an email at artnindia@gmail.com.

We pay shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be added to your refund.

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.

If you are shipping an item over $75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service. We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
