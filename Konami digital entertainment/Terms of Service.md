3. **3\. PROMOTIONAL VIRTUAL CURRENCY.**  
    Konami may issue promotional Virtual Currency using methods designated by Konami, such as through promotional activities or other means that do not require payment ("Promotional Virtual Currency"). Activities eligible to receive Promotional Virtual Currency, quantity of Promotional Virtual Currency issued, and terms and conditions for the issuance of Promotional Virtual Currency, as well as other terms and conditions, will be determined by Konami.
4. **4\. PURCHASED VIRTUAL CURRENCY.**  
    The purchase price for Virtual Currency or the purchase unit of Virtual Currency may change periodically without notice.
