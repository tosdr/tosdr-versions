**Why is Christian Science in our name?**

![CSM logo](https://www.csmonitor.com/extension/csm_base/design/csm_design/images/csm-logo-200.svg)

#### Why is Christian Science in our name?

Our name is about honesty. The Monitor is owned by The Christian Science Church, and we’ve always been transparent about that.

The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it.

Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope.

A hour’s wage for a cup of coffee

“The minimum wage back home was $7.25, and here, that’s a coffee.” That’s Jillian McGeehin, a small-town student now attending the University of Chicago. Today’s story by Kelly Field looks at why relatively few rural students go to top colleges – and what can be done about it. Elite colleges have widened America’s cultural rifts. Kelly’s story considers the idea that, in reaching out to rural America, maybe they can be a part of the solution, too.
