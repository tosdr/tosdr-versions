**Why is Christian Science in our name?**

![CSM logo](https://www.csmonitor.com/extension/csm_base/design/csm_design/images/csm-logo-200.svg)

#### Why is Christian Science in our name?

Our name is about honesty. The Monitor is owned by The Christian Science Church, and we’ve always been transparent about that.

The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it.

Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope.

Eyes on a power surprise

Green hydrogen from seawater and scrap aluminum?The best innovations help with two or more problems at once. They utilize what’s at hand. In today’s Points of Progress column we land on the work of researchers trying to create a clean option for maritime fuel, which is notoriously polluting.Could the discovery decarbonize heavy industry, or power homes, as the global need for energy rises? We’ll see. But it’s a Monitor hallmark to note credible wins, even nascent ones. And the turning of ocean-going vessels into old-school settings for the future of power generation represents a step worth watching.
