The Tools available on LinangData, namely, formatters, validators, encoders & decoders, code beautifiers, generators, converters, string utilities, and other web resources available on linangdata.com (the "Tools") are primarily client-side tools and do not store data on a server.

Where a tool uses a third-party API, LinangData does not make any representation or guarantee how this data is used by the third-party API. For example, the "Grammar & Style" tool, is processed by a third-party API provided by https://languagetool.org.

Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they used prior to coming to this Website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to maintain and improve the Website and our products.

Google Signals

.

The Website uses a tool called “**Google Signals**” to collect information about use of the Website. When we activate Google Signals, some existing Google Analytics features are updated to also include aggregated data from Google users who have turned on “Ads Personalization” (Ads Personalization available at [https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662856/](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662856/)). Audiences that we create in Google Analytics and publish to Google Ads and other Google Marketing Platform advertising products can serve ads in cross device-eligible remarketing campaigns to Google users who have turned on Ads Personalization. Google Analytics collects additional information about users who have turned on Ads Personalization, base across device types and on aggregated data from users who have turned on Ads Personalization. The data is user based rather than session based. The Cross Device reports include only aggregated data. No data for individual users is ever exposed. Youcan modify your interests, choose whether your Personal Data is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services in the Ads Personalization link above.
