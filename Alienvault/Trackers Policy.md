**Essential Cookies** are Cookies that are required to provide you with features or services that you have requested. For example, Cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or use a shopping cart. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Sites’ performance and may make certain features and services unavailable.

**Analytical Cookies** allow us to understand how visitors use our Site. This includes information about the number of visitors to the site, what pages visitors view on our site and how long visitors are viewing pages on the site. Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our advertising campaigns and to optimize our Sites’ content for those who engage with our advertising.

**Third Party Cookies** are Cookies placed by a third party on Your Device and may provide information to those third parties about browsing habits (including your visits to our Sites, the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked) that may help identify if certain services that such third parties provide are being used, identify your interests, retarget you, and serve advertisements that are relevant to you. We do not have control or access to such Cookies. If you look at one page on our Sites, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our Services or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services.

The length of time a Persistent Cookie stays on your Device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use Persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Sites, how often you return, how your use of the Sites may vary over time, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Sites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.

WHAT IS GOOGLE ANALYTICS AND HOW IS IT USED?

On behalf of AlienVault, Google will use the generated information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activities, and to provide the website operator with additional services connected with website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser in connection with Google Analytics is not collated with other data by Google.
