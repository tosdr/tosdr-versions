### 16\. Code of Conduct

Here, “contribution” means any material posted or uploaded to our websites by a member of the public, including without limitation any text, photographs, graphics, video or audio material.

YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS:

* must be your own original work. You may be entitled to incorporate into your contribution certain material made available on our websites but only where that is expressly made clear. Otherwise, all material in your contributions must be your own original piece of work and should not plagiarize others’ work;
* must not infringe anyone else’s rights, including copyright. Your contributions must not plagiarize or infringe the rights of any other person including any copyright, database, trade mark, trade secret, privacy, publicity, personal or proprietary rights of any kind. Existing articles, news reports, music, video clips or other copyright material must have the explicit permission of the relevant copyright owners;
* must not contain unlawful or objectionable content nor involve disruptive, offensive or abusive behavior. Please be respectful and civil to other members, even if you disagree with them. Material that is unlawful, harassing, threatening, defamatory, obscene, offensive, abusive, hateful, inflammatory, profane, racially, sexually or religiously offensive or otherwise objectionable or unlawful is not acceptable;
* must be true and accurate. Your contributions must be true, accurate (where they state facts) and be genuinely held (where they state opinions);
* must not contain unsuitable or irrelevant website addresses or URLs. Links to pornography, commercial or other inappropriate content may be deleted;
* must not promote illegal or anti-social behavior. Contributions must not contain violent or sexually explicit material or advocate, promote, or assist any unlawful act such as (by way of example only) terrorist acts, copyright infringement, or computer misuse;
* must not misrepresent their origins. Contributions and/or user names may not be used to impersonate any other person, to misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or to give the impression that they emanate from us, if that is not the case;
* must not be in any language other than English. Contributions in other languages may be removed;
* must not involve any flooding, spamming or advertising. Flooding is when the same comment is posted over and over in the same forum; spamming is the posting of the same comment (or very similar) to more than one forum. All advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, junk mail and any other forms of commercial solicitation are prohibited;
* must not disclose any personal information. Contributions to this website are publicly available and can be viewed by others with whom you may not wish to share such information. Do not include any personal or personally identifiable information about you or others (including your own or anyone else’s email address).

BREACH OF THE CODE OF CONDUCT  
It will be our sole decision as to whether there has been a breach of this Code of Conduct. We have the right (but not the obligation) to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any contribution in whole or in part that we deem to be in breach of the Code of Conduct. Where we believe there is a breach of the Code of Conduct, we may take whatever action we feel is appropriate in the circumstances.

If you reasonably believe that any contribution to our websites made by another user contravenes this Code of Conduct and/or any of the Website Terms of Use, please notify us using the “Contact Us” form.

### 17\. Failure to Comply

Failure to comply with these Terms of Use constitutes a material breach of the Website Terms, which could result in us taking any of the following actions:

* issuing a warning to you;
* immediate, temporary, or permanent withdrawal of any contribution or of your right to use our websites, including deletion of any personal profile;
* legal proceedings against you for reimbursement of all losses and costs on an indemnity basis (including, but not limited to, reasonable administrative and legal costs) resulting from the breach and/or further legal action against you; and/or
* disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities or other relevant third parties as we reasonably feel is necessary.

We exclude liability for actions taken in response to breaches of this Code of Conduct. The responses described in this policy are not limited, and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.

### 18\. Miscellaneous

Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. We may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of our Site or service at any time. LevelBlue reserves the right to change system configurations, product specifications, upgrades, pricing, layouts, options and any other specifications at any time without notice. We may also impose limits or restrictions on certain services, features or content or restrict your access to parts or all of our Site without notice or liability.
