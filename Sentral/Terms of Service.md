22.3       Where the customer acquires goods or services under these terms and the goods or services are not goods or services are of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, then Sentral limits its liability for a failure to comply with any consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law (other than where to do so would otherwise cause all or part of this clause to be void) to, at Sentral’s option, in the case of goods, repairing or replacing the goods or paying the cost of having the goods repaired or replaced, and in the case of services, re-supplying the services or paying the cost of having the services re-supplied.

Support and maintenance includes any updates released by Sentral to its customers generally during the term of this agreement. All other requests for specific enhancements or new functionality will be considered on a case by case basis and may be subject to an additional charge.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, the support provided is telephone support and on-line support, including remote access to the customer’s file server.

Onsite support may be arranged by agreement and may be subject to an additional charge.

If any payment is not made within 14 days of any due date for payment of annual licence/s or support agreements Sentral shall be entitled, at its discretion, to suspend its remaining obligations under this agreement until the payment has been paid; and/or

1. _terminate the licence; and/or_
2. _re-possess the software; and/or_
3. _cease to provide the support services; and/or_

**SMART BACKUP DISASTER RECOVERY SERVICE**

Customers who do not access the software via a cloud hosting service may choose to purchase a back-up and disaster recovery service from Sentral, which is described in Schedule 1 of these terms.

The back up and disaster recovery service will commence on the date specified in the Smart BackUp Invoice. Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, the Smart BackUp service shall continue for the _term specified in the invoice._

During that term, Sentral will

create a replica of the customer’s local on-premise data back-up generated by the software and store this in two other locations in Australia. The copy will be encrypted in transit and held in off-site storage within Australia. The replication process will be scheduled to run each evening.

The customer remains responsible for ensuring that local data backup is operational and comprehensive and acknowledges and agrees that Sentral will have no liability to the customer or any third party if the local data backup is corrupted, or has not run (for example, due to lack of disk space, among other reasons).

In the event of local server failure, Sentral will make the local data back-up replication available to the customer within 24 hours of being notified. Additional costs to associate this data with the local Sentral instance may be charged on a time and material basis.

Further detail on Service levels are specified in the _Schedule 1_and may be varied at the discretion of Sentral from time to time by placing those varied service levels on Sentral website.

Upon expiration of the _term_, the service will automatically renew for another 12-month period, unless either party provides notice to the other party of its intention to not renew the service. If Sentral provides notice to the customer prior to the expiry of the then current term, that it intends to vary the _terms of the service_ and, by the expiry of the then current term, the customer has not provided written notice that it does not accept the varied terms, then the _service_ shall be automatically renewed for a 12-month period, on those varied terms. If the customer provides notice to Sentral that it does not accept the varied terms, then the service will terminate at the expiry of the then current term.

Sentral may vary these terms at its discretion by posting amended terms on Sentral website. If the customer continues to pay for, or continues to use the service it is deemed to have accepted any changes to the terms.

Sentral_’s_ aggregate liability to the _customer_ arising under or in connection with the disaster recovery service, in a calendar year, will not exceed the amount of the fees paid by the _customer_ for the disaster recovery service in that calendar year

The parties acknowledge and agree that all terms and conditions of the Software licence apply to the disaster recovery service.

**SMART BACKUP DISASTER RECOVERY SERVICE**

**SCHEDULE 1 – SERVICE DESCRIPTION AND EXCLUSIONS**

Sentral will create a replica of the customer’s local on-premise data back-up generated by the software and store this in two other locations in Australia. The copy will be encrypted in transit and held in off-site storage within Australia. The replication process will be scheduled to run each evening.

In the event of local server failure, Sentral will make the local data back-up replication available to the customer within 24 hours of being notified. Additional costs to associate this data with the local Sentral instance may be charged on a time and material basis.

**Exclusions**

* The Service is dependent on the server having consistent access to the internet. If this is interrupted or changed by the customer, then Sentral disclaims all liability for the server not having an accurate back-up.
* The Service does not store data that is provided by third parties. These third parties include, but are not limited to:
    * Moodle
    * Xero
* The Service does not store customer-created data that is hosted by Sentral that is not core to the data required for the service to operate. This includes:
    * Fileshares where the service is used by a customer as an internal fileshare service; or
    * Websites where the service is used by the customer to host a static HTML site.
* Any data charges as a result of the use of the service are to be borne by the customer, not Sentral.
