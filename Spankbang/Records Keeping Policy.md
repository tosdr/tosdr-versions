**18 U.S.C. § 2257 STATEMENT**

For the purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 2257, we are not a producer (primary or secondary) of any content found on this website. For § 2257 records for any content found on this website, please direct your request to the producer, site or user which produced or uploaded the content.

Our website allows for third parties to upload their own content, but we do not create the content ourselves. So while we strive for accurate compliance, we may not be 100% accurate. Any content that we are notified of as being inappropriate, illegal, unlawful, harassing, offensive or otherwise objectionable may be removed by us, therefore we ask users to flag any such content by e-mailing us or clicking the appropriate link on the content’s webpage.

We undertake the following procedures in order to ensure compliance with § 2257: (1) we require that all users, both those only accessing the website and those uploading content, to be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in their jurisdiction (if higher); and (2) we require that all users uploading content onto the website to represent and warrant that they have complied with § 2257, including by ensuring that all persons appearing in the content are over the age of 18, that they have consented to the use of their likeness and that the user uploading the work is keeping records in compliance with § 2257.

In connection with any content on this website for which the website operator is deemed to be the producer (primary or secondary) pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2257 and 28 CFR § 75, such depictions are exempt from the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 2257 and 28 CFR § 75 because, inter alia, they do not portray actual sexually explicit content.
