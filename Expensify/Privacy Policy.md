In addition, we (or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your credit card number or account information when you upgrade to a paid account or use a feature or function in the Expensify Service that requires payment, such as accessing a Workspace.

We may share your geo-location data with third parties for the sole purpose of providing these services. If you do not wish to allow us to collect and/or share your information in this manner please opt out by contacting us at [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com). 
    
* **Technical Data.** The Expensify Service (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collects Personal Data from you, such as browser type, your approximate geographic location of your mobile device or computer (from your Internet Protocol (IP) address), operating system and version, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, information about your application, operating environment and hardware profiles and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Identifiers (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and/or access to the Expensify Service and your activity on the Site and the Application. Like most internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit the Site, use the Application or access your account on our network. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Application, the events that occur within the Application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the Application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any Personal Data you submit within the mobile Application. 
    
* **Information about your Interactions with Expensify.** We collect information about your interactions with Expensify, which may include your use of our products, services, websites or apps, including information collected using Cookies and other technologies (for further information on how we use Cookies and the information we collect using Cookies, see our cookies policy in Section 5 below). It may also include communications with us, such as if you contact our customer service centers, including recording calls and the contents of your device screen (by Expensify itself or using a third-party service) for quality and training purposes. This may also include data about your participation in promotions or programs. This may also include data about how you exercise rights or preferences regarding your data. We also retain information on your behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence.

* **Other Self-Reported Information.** You have the option to provide us with additional information about yourself and others through surveys, forms, features and applications. Where such information is not required by Expensify for the purposes of providing the services to you, you acknowledge that Expensify may store, use and disclose such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
    
* **Member-Generated Content.** Some of our Services allow you to create and post or upload content, such as data, text, SMS, software, music, audio, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or other materials that you create or provide to us or to other Members or Non-Members through either a public or private transmission. For example, Member-Generated Content includes any discussions, posts, or messages you send on our Forums, as well as messages or SMS you send using Expensify Chat. Our Site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them, as well as by our third party service providers such as OpenAI, L.L.C., to ensure compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy and Content Standards through our Enforcement Policy, or third-party suppliers such as Spotnana Technology, Inc.. 
    
* **Referral Information and Sharing.** When you refer a person to Expensify, we will ask for that person’s name, phone number and/or email address and collect this information directly from you. By participating in a referral program or by choosing to share information with another person, you confirm that the person has given you permission for Expensify to communicate with him or her. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about Expensify, or if, as a Corporate Administrator, you refer an employee or other authorized service provider to connect with your Workspace (each such individual, a “Referred Party”), you must seek permission of the Referred Party so that Expensify may use their name, phone number and/or email address to contact them about the Expensify Service. By providing us with the Referred Party’s name and email address, you warrant that the Referred Party agrees to such contact. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or SMS message inviting him or her to visit the site. If you were referred by a friend or a Corporate Administrator, and you activate an Account, Expensify shall treat such Personal Data as if you had directly provided it to Expensify, which such Personal Data will be processed as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If your friend is a resident of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Australia, please make sure they are happy to be contacted by us.

The information we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the third-party social media service. Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statements of the third-party companies providing them. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third party websites and services before linking or connecting them to our website or Service.

We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site or Application in order to perform and improve the Expensify Service. If you provide us Personal Data about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

When you interact with the Site or the Application, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. We will generally refer to cookies, web beacons, flash cookies, and pixels collectively as “cookies”, “tracking technology” or “identifiers” in this policy. By using our Services, you are agreeing that we can use cookies and other tracking technologies described in this Cookie Policy. 

**A. What are cookies and how long are they stored?** 

Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site or Application (as the case may be). A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web or Application session and expire when you close your browser or exit the Application (known as “session cookies). Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site or Application and will last for longer (known as persistent cookies). A persistent cookie lasts until you or your browser deletes the cookies or they expire. 

Cookies set by us are called “first party cookies”, while cookies set by parties other than Expensify are called “third party cookies”. The parties that set third party cookies can recognize your device, both when you use the Services and when you use other websites or mobile apps. You should check the third party’s website for more information about how they use cookies and other tracking technologies. Both first party and third party cookies can serve a number of different functions, such as analytics, marketing and advertising. 

**B. What other similar tracking technologies does Expensify use?**  

* **Web Beacons:** In addition to cookies, web beacons may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use of the Site or Application. Web beacons are small image files within the content of the Site or Application for analytics purposes so we or third parties can understand which parts of the Site or Application are visited and which functions of the Site or Application are used and whether particular content is of interest. 
    
* **Flash cookies:** We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services.
    
* **Mobile Device Identifiers:** We also use mobile device identifiers which perform a similar role, like the IDFA used by Apple devices and the UDID used by Android devices. 
    

**C. How do we use cookies?** 

We use cookies to provide our Site, gather information about your usage patterns when you navigate the Sites in order to enhance your personalized experience, and to understand usage patterns to improve our Sites, products, and services. We also allow certain third parties to place cookies on our Site in order to collect information about your online activities on our Sites over time and across different websites you visit. This information is used to provide advertising tailored to your interests on websites you visit, also known as interest based advertising, and to analyze the effectiveness of such advertising. 

Usage information may be linked to your account in order to assist Expensify to provide services to your account, for example analyzing data for the purposes of trouble shooting. Expensify will not sell or disclose usage data to any third party unless such usage data has been aggregated or de-identified. 

Cookies on our Sites are generally divided into the following categories:

* **Strictly necessary cookies.** These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website or provide necessary functions relating to the services you request. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services. 
    
* **Analytical or performance cookies.** These allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. These cookies also allow us to collect statistical information about how you use the Site or App (including how long you spend on the Site or Application) and where you have come to the Site or Application from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site and which functions of the Application are most popular with users. 
    
* **Functionality cookies.** These cookies enable helpful but non-essential website functions that improve your website experience. By recognizing you when you return to our website, they may, for example, allow us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, or remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). This also enables us to customize elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site or Application We also use functional social media plug ins, such as the Facebook “Like” button and Widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set an Identifier to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the Privacy Policy of the company providing it.
    
* **Targeting cookies.** These cookies enable different advertising related functions. They may allow us to record information about your visit to our website, such as pages visited, links followed, and videos viewed so we can make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.

We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Site or Application or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt -out of interest-based advertising click [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or [https://youradchoices.com/control](https://youradchoices.com/control) (or if located in the European Union click Union click [here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)).

**Analytics**

We and our vendors (including but not limited to Google Analytics) may use Identifiers and similar tracking technologies to monitor performance and usage on the site for internal analytics and performance monitoring.

Information we disclose to third parties:

| 3rd party categories |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal Information Categories | Our Affiliates | Our Business Partners | Third-party Marketing Partners | Government Entities, Including Law Enforcement \*See Disclosure |
| Information Related to Characteristics Protected Under California or Federal Law | No  | No  | No  | Yes |
| Commercial Information | Yes | Yes | No  | Yes |

**3.  Retention — California Residents**

Expensify has in place a records-retention schedule reflecting our intended retention periods for certain types of information. The following reflects the longest applicable intended retention period by personal-information category for information related to California consumers acquired on or after January 1, 2023. Once the intended retention period has passed, subject information is to be deleted or modified such that it is no longer personal information.

| Personal Information Categories | Intended Retention Period |
| --- | --- |
| Biometrics | Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations |
| Commercial Information | 10 years after expiration of contractual obligations |
| Education Information | 10 Years after termination of employment |
| Geolocation Data | Up to 3 Years |
| Identifiers | Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations |
| Identifiers (Online) | Up to 3 years |
| Information Related to Characteristics Protected Under California or Federal Law | Up to 3 years |
| Internet and Other Electronic Network Activity Information | Up to 3 years |
| Other Financial, Medical and Health Information | Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations |
| Professional or Employment Related Information | 10 Years after termination of employment |
| Profile Inferences | Up to 3 years |
| Sensory Information | Up to 40 Days |

There are a number of reasons personal information may be retained longer than the intended retention period. For example, deletion or modification does not happen immediately after a retention period has passed and instead executes periodically, no less frequently than annually. Additionally, some information systems or information may be placed on legal holds due to potential litigation or regulatory review and information, therefore, is not deleted or modified.

**4.  Consumer Privacy Rights**
