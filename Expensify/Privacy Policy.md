If you do not wish to allow us to collect and/or share your information in this manner please opt out by contacting us at [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com).

We may also use Identifiers (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and/or access to the Expensify Service and your activity on the Site and the Application. Like most internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit the Site, use the Application or access your account on our network. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Application, the events that occur within the Application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the Application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any Personal Data you submit within the mobile Application.

You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them, as well as by our third party service providers such as OpenAI, L.L.C., to ensure compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy and Content Standards through our Enforcement Policy, or third-party suppliers such as Spotnana Technology, Inc..
    
* **Referral Information and Sharing.** When you refer a person to Expensify, we will ask for that person's name, phone number and/or email address and collect this information directly from you.

By using our Services, you are agreeing that we can use cookies and other tracking technologies described in this Cookie Policy.

#### 5.1 What are cookies and how long are they stored?

Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or mobile device (as the case may be) when you visit a website or access or use a mobile application and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site or Application (as the case may be).

Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site or Application and will last for longer (known as persistent cookies). A persistent cookie lasts until you or your browser deletes the cookies or they expire.

Cookies set by us are called "**first party cookies**", while cookies set by parties other than Expensify are called "**third party cookies**". The parties that set third party cookies can recognize your device, both when you use the Services and when you use other websites or mobile apps. You should check the third party's website for more information about how they use cookies and other tracking technologies. Both first party and third party cookies can serve a number of different functions, such as analytics, marketing and advertising.

Any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, "Related Entities"), may share some or all of your Personal Data, in which case we will require our Related Entities to honor this Privacy Policy and your Personal Data will only be used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

A key feature of Expensify's Karma Program is the opportunity for those enrolled in the Karma Program to receive emails and chats from Expensify and participants in the Karma Program. Whether you signed up for the program on your own behalf or if you are a member of the Karma Program through your Corporate Member, as part of administering this program we will disclose your chosen login credentials (e-mail address or phone number, depending on your chosen registration method) to volunteers of the Karma Program and other Members participating in the Karma program.

If we receive requests from law enforcement or private parties seeking information, we are prepared to take a stand when appropriate. We have various tools at our disposal that we may elect to rely on to do so depending on the circumstances, for example: our legal team reviewing these requests to ensure that parties are following applicable laws and statutes; rejecting or challenging requests that have no legal basis or are unclear, overbroad, or otherwise inappropriate; construing legal process as narrowly as possible; encouraging parties to look elsewhere for the information. We are prepared to ensure that requests have a legal basis.

Except as otherwise stated in this policy and our Terms of Service, we do not sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from the Expensify Service to third parties.

We may aggregate or de-identify information collected through the Expensify Service so that such information is no longer directly identifiable to an individual.

##### 15.2.4 Retention — California Residents

Expensify has in place a records-retention schedule reflecting our intended retention periods for certain types of information. The following reflects the longest applicable intended retention period by personal-information category for information related to California consumers acquired on or after January 1, 2023. Once the intended retention period has passed, subject information is to be deleted or modified such that it is no longer personal information.

| Personal Information Categories | Intended Retention Period |
| --- | --- |
| Biometrics | Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations |
| Commercial Information | 10 years after expiration of contractual obligations |
| Education Information | 10 Years after termination of employment |
| Geolocation Data | Up to 3 Years |
| Identifiers | Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations |
| Identifiers (Online) | Up to 3 years |
| Information Related to Characteristics Protected Under California or Federal Law | Up to 3 years |
| Internet and Other Electronic Network Activity Information | Up to 3 years |
| Other Financial, Medical and Health Information | Up to 10 years after last activity, subject to contractual obligations |
| Professional or Employment Related Information | 10 Years after termination of employment |
| Profile Inferences | Up to 3 years |
| Sensory Information | Up to 40 Days |

There are a number of reasons personal information may be retained longer than the intended retention period. For example, deletion or modification does not happen immediately after a retention period has passed and instead executes periodically, no less frequently than annually. Additionally, some information systems or information may be placed on legal holds due to potential litigation or regulatory review and information, therefore, is not deleted or modified.
