By accessing or using the Expensify Service in any way, including browsing the Site, registering for an Expensify Account, downloading the Application or any Application upgrades, using the Application on your mobile device, or by entering into a statement of work with Expensify (a "**Statement of Work**"), you are indicating that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, then you have no right to access or use the Expensify Service or Site Content. If you agree to the Terms of Service and do not agree to any Program Terms, do not use the corresponding Program. If you accept or agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms of Service and, in such event, "**you**" and "**your**" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.

Supplemental Terms for Certain Services. Certain additional services offered as part of the Expensify Service may require you to enter into a separate agreement and/or be subject to additional terms. In the event of any conflict between these Terms of Service and the additional terms, these Terms of Service will control.

### 1\. Using the Expensify Service.

#### 1.1 Who Can Use the Expensify Service?

By accessing or using the Expensify Service, you represent and warrant to Expensify that: (i) you are of legal age to form a binding contract, or, if you are a minor, you have your parent's permission to use the Expensify Service and your parent or guardian has read and agrees to these Terms of Service on your behalf; (ii) all registration information you submit is accurate, current and complete; (iii) you will maintain the accuracy and completeness of such information; and (iv) if you are accepting these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity as a Corporate Administrator (as defined below), you have the authority to bind that company or legal entity to these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Expensify Service is revoked in such jurisdictions. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Expensify Service.

#### 1.2 Individual Account Registration

In order to access certain parts of the Expensify Service, you must register to create an account ("**Account**") and become a Member ("**Member**"). When registering with Expensify as an individual you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Expensify Service's registration form (such information being the "**Registration Data**") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or we have grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Expensify Service (or any portion thereof).

If you connect with a Workspace (as defined below), you hereby understand and agree that the Corporate Member that manages such Workspace has access and a right to the Member Data related to transactions associated with the Workspace (including any Personal Data, as defined in the [Privacy Policy](https://use.expensify.com/privacy)) for its internal bookkeeping purposes and payroll purposes, if subscribed to the Payroll Service. A Corporate Member will maintain the following information at a minimum, when you connect with a Workspace: full name, email, phone number, and expense data. You are required to provide credit card information in your Registration Data to access a Workspace and certain other paid features; however, the Corporate Member will not receive or review your payment information provided through the Expensify Service. Any Corporate Member who utilizes the Payroll Service will maintain the information set forth in the Payroll Terms. Please contact the Corporate Member directly for more information about what Personal Data the Corporate Member maintains. Further, in certain circumstances where the Corporate Member has [Domain Control](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Claim-And-Verify-A-Domain), the Corporate Member may have authorization and access to administer certain advanced security settings, including the ability to delete your Account (unless you provide an alternative login not under the Corporate Member's [Domain Control](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Claim-And-Verify-A-Domain)), control certain settings, and control how you use the Expensify Service. We will notify you if a Corporate Member enables [Domain Control](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Claim-And-Verify-A-Domain) and has a right to view or make changes to the settings in your Account. Where a Corporate Member has also subscribed to Expensify's Payroll Service, the Corporate Member may have access to additional Personal Data as set forth in the Payroll Terms and Privacy Policy.

You may not authorize any third party to access or use the Expensify Service or any payment cards managed through your Account in connection with the Corporate Card Program (a "**Card**") on your behalf. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user ID and password and/or other sign-on mechanism and keeping the Card secure and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user ID or password and/or other sign-on mechanism. You agree to immediately notify Expensify of any unauthorized use of your user ID or password and/or other sign-on mechanism or Card, or any other breach of security, and will (if allowed by the Expensify Service) immediately stop using your Card where you know or believe Cards have been compromised or stolen or may be misused. Expensify cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from any unauthorized use of your Account or Card.

#### 1.4 Workspaces

In order to create an Account on behalf of a company or other legal entity, rather than an individual (a "**Corporate Member**"), you must register to create an Account as an administrator or policy holder for the Corporate Member (a "**Corporate Administrator**"). When registering on behalf of a Corporate Member, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete Registration Data about yourself and the Corporate Member, and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate the Corporate Member's Account and associated Member Accounts and refuse any and all current or future use of the Expensify Service (or any portion thereof) by Corporate Member and related Members. . Corporate Administrators may appoint other Members as Corporate Administrators on behalf of Corporate Members provided that each Corporate Member shall only have one Corporate Administrator responsible for payments and billing on the Application (the "**Primary Corporate Administrator**"). Any Corporate Administrator using the Expensify Service via [new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com/), may update the Corporate Member Account to include access to additional services. Any such update would trigger a notification to the Primary Corporate Administrator of such change and obligation of the Corporate Member to pay any additional applicable fees as set forth on the Expensify Services.

A Corporate Member's Account may host and administer one or more workspaces incorporating corporate policies, chat features, and intracompany payment features that individual Members can connect with to facilitate transactions on the Expensify Service (a "**Workspace**"). The Corporate Member acknowledges that individual Members retain ultimate administrative control over their individual Accounts and the Member Data and Member-Generated Content within them, except to the extent a Corporate Member has [Domain Control](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Claim-And-Verify-A-Domain) over Accounts.

You may not allow any third party (other than authorized agents of the Corporate Member) to access or use the Expensify Service or the Cards on Corporate Member's behalf. The Corporate Member is responsible for (i) all Member Data and Member-Generated Content posted and activity that occurs under its Account; (ii) maintaining the security of its Account login credentials; and (iii) promptly notifying us upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Expensify Service through its Account.

If the Corporate Member is a party to a Statement of Work with Expensify, these Terms of Service shall begin on the effective date of the Statement of Work and, unless terminated as otherwise provided in the Statement of Work, shall continue through the term set forth in the Statement of Work (the "**SOW Term**") and will automatically renew for a successive one (1) year term following the end of each SOW Term, unless either party notifies the other, not less than ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then current SOW Term, of its intention not to renew.

Either party to a Statement of Work may, by written notice, request any changes, additions, deletions, or modifications to any Statement of Work. No changes to a Statement of Work will be effective until a written amendment has been signed by both parties. If any such change affects the amount due or the time of performance thereunder, the parties shall negotiate in good faith a mutually acceptable appropriate adjustment. In the event of conflict or inconsistency between these Terms of Service and those of any Statement of Work, the Statement of Work shall control.

#### 1.5 Linked Financial Accounts

In order to access certain features of the Expensify Service (such as the [Corporate Card Program](https://use.expensify.com/corporatecardprogramterms), [](https://use.expensify.com/conciergeterms)[Travel](https://use.expensify.com/travelterms), Expensify Invoicing, [Karma Program](https://use.expensify.com/karmaprogramterms), [Expensify's ACH features](https://use.expensify.com/achterms), or [Payroll Service](https://use.expensify.com/payrollterms)), a Member or a Corporate Member may need to connect its Account or Workspace (as applicable) with (i) one or more accounts that are held with a financial institution, and/or (ii) an account with other third-party payment providers (including a debit card, credit card, checking account or other permitted payment method), each of which are linked to or authorized for use through the Member's or Corporate Member's Account (each, a "Linked Financial Account"). You acknowledge and agree that you have the authority to access and connect a Linked Financial Account to the Expensify Service, and to authorize the initiation of payments, including the initiation of ACH debit or credit entries or necessary adjustments or reversals or check payments, in accordance with any payment instructions provided in connection with your use of the Expensify Service.

Further, to participate in such features, as a Member or a Corporate Administrator, you may be required to provide certain information (including Personal Data as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://use.expensify.com/privacy)), which may include the Member or Corporate Member's full name, email, phone number, business information (such as registered business name and state of incorporation for the Corporate Member, the business address, employer identification number, ownership details, actual or anticipated revenue, the nature of the business, and details from Linked Financial Accounts and other business information we may request from time to time), Financial Data (both current and historical), and the name, contact information, and date of birth of individual Members or beneficial owners, the social security number of beneficial owners/controlling officers (requesting users), and documentary information used to verify the business and Personal Data. "**Financial Data**" means a bank balance, transaction data, and account information accessible to Expensify through Linked Financial Accounts or Third-Party Service Providers (as defined in the [Corporate Card Program Terms](https://use.expensify.com/corporatecardprogramterms), as applicable).

#### 1.6 Bill Pay and Invoicing

In order to access Expensify's bill payment and invoice payment features on the Expensify Service (collectively, "**Expensify Invoicing**"), so you can make payments to third party merchants ("**Merchants**") or request and receive payments from third party clients ("**Clients**"), we will require a Member or a Corporate Member, as the case may be, to connect with a Linked Financial Account.

When you provide information about your Merchants and Clients to the Expensify Service, you agree to provide correct and current information, and you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary authorizations and consents from the Merchant or Client to share such information. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of all such information. Expensify will have no liability for losses or damages resulting from the accuracy or inaccuracy of the Merchant or Client information.

By agreeing to these Terms of Service and using the check printing feature of Expensify Invoicing, you authorize Expensify or its third-party provider to send checks drawn on your bank account identified in your Account. The accuracy of all the bank account details, account and routing numbers and the address of the Merchant or Client is solely your responsibility. You will be responsible for notifying your financial institution of any voided or cancelled checks, ensuring the bank account associated with Expensify Invoicing is funded, and will be responsible for any fees related to the voiding or cancelling of checks sent by Expensify or its third-party providers on your behalf.

Expensify reserves the right, in our reasonable discretion and without any liability to any Members, Corporate Members, or other third parties, to (i) limit or refuse to make, process or issue any payment initiated or requested through Expensify Invoicing, and (ii) impose limits on the amount of money sent through Expensify Invoicing, on a per transaction or a cumulative basis, and to change those limits at any time. In each case, Expensify will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to the affected Member, but it will not be required to do so. To the extent permitted by law, you grant Expensify the right to apply or set off any money or credit balance in which you have an interest and which is in Expensify's possession, custody or control, in satisfaction of any amounts or liabilities that you owe to Expensify. You acknowledge and agree that you will not use Expensify Invoicing for payment of child support, alimony, taxes or other court-directed or government payments, fines or penalties.

Payment processing services for Members or Corporate Members, as the case may be, on the Expensify platform are provided by Stripe and are subject to the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal), which includes the [Stripe Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/legal) (collectively, the "**Stripe Services Agreement**"). You agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of the Expensify Service enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Expensify Service accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Expensify Service to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

#### 1.7 Personal Payments

The Expensify Service, via [new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com/), allows Members to track informal debts, expenses, and bills, by allowing Members to post debts and payments and notes about who they owe, who owes them and why. You agree that this service is provided as-is and on an as-available basis. You agree (1) that these debts are not legally binding, and represent informal information sharing, (2) that Expensify cannot guarantee the accuracy of information entered by Members or payment from any Members or non-Members for such debts, and (3) any payments made based on the amounts in the personal payments feature on or through third-party platforms, websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Expensify shall be subject to the terms of such third-party platforms, websites, or services. You expressly relieve Expensify from any and all liability arising from (1) any transactions occurring or not occurring via the personal payments feature and (2) your use of any third-party platforms, websites, or services to process any transactions posted in the personal payments feature.

#### 1.8 Third Party Payment Services

Some users will have access to other payment functions of other companies through links on the Site or Application. These links or API integrations will initiate a payment or request by pre-populating some information (such as email address, phone number, amount or notes) as part of payments completed on a third party payment system. You agree to abide by the terms of service of any payment service linked to by Expensify, and you agree that Expensify is in no way responsible or liable for transactions and service provided by a third party linked to or from the Expensify Service.

#### 1.9 Fees and Payment

By establishing an Expensify Account, you agree to the term, pricing, payment, and billing policies set forth (a) herein, (b) on the Site (including our [pricing page](https://use.expensify.com/pricing)), (c) in the Application, and/or (d) if applicable, in a separately executed Statement of Work. The use of various offerings within the Expensify Service may be subject to additional terms as set forth on the Site or Application (such additional terms being incorporated herein by reference), including but not limited to expense reporting, SmartScan, certain functionalities of invoices and bill processing, payroll services, Travel Services, functionality within Workspaces, and other services described on the Expensify Service. You acknowledge and agree that you may not access all features of the Expensify Service without providing valid credit card information and agreeing to pay any applicable fees. All fees paid for the Expensify Service are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms of Service or Statement of Work. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars, Pound Sterling, New Zealand Dollar, or Australian Dollar, as applicable. You are solely responsible for the payment of, and shall pay when due, all applicable sales and use taxes and similar fees now in force, enacted or imposed in the future on the delivery of Expensify Service and/or any related transactions (except for taxes assessed on Expensify's net income or personal property). If for any reason Expensify pays any such taxes, duties or excises, you will reimburse Expensify for such taxes, duties or excises, other than taxes on Expensify's net income. Expensify reserves the right to change the prices for any service package with fifteen days' notice to you prior to the next billing cycle, unless otherwise set forth in a Statement of Work.

#### 1.10 Term and Termination

The term of your Expensify Service package is as set forth on the Site and/or Application and in your billing account details. If your selected Expensify Service package requires a recurring subscription fee, your Expensify Service package will automatically renew, unless you change your billing settings to month-to-month, we terminate it, or you notify us by email ([concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com)) of your decision to terminate your current Expensify Service package prior to the end of the term. Expensify shall notify you of an upcoming renewal. You must cancel any automatically renewing Expensify Service package before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the next renewal term to your credit card; provided, that you are responsible at the time of cancellation for paying in full all subscription fees accrued up to the date of your cancellation. All fees and charges are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially-used periods. If your Expensify Service package is for a term of 12 months or longer, your subscription is deemed to have begun during the month in which you were first billed by Expensify for the Expensify Service package (or, in the event that a Corporate Member connects additional individual Members to its Workspace or otherwise connects individual Members to its Expensify Service package after beginning its subscription, from the month in which you were first billed for those additional individual Members). If you have executed a Statement of Work, the SOW Term and termination provisions shall be as set forth in such Statement of Work.

If you breach any of these Terms of Service, the [Expensify Visa® Commercial Card Program Terms](https://use.expensify.com/commercialcardprogramterms) , the [Expensify Visa® Commercial Card Agreement](https://use.expensify.com/commercialcardagreement), the [Corporate Card Program Terms](https://use.expensify.com/corporatecardprogramterms), the [Card Agreement](https://use.expensify.com/expensifycardagreement), or the [Payroll Terms](https://use.expensify.com/payrollterms), or violate the rules of an Issuer or Card Network (as defined in the Expensify Visa® Commercial Card Program Terms, or Corporate Card Program Terms), Expensify will have the right to suspend, disable or terminate your Account or Cards or terminate these Terms of Service, at its sole discretion and without prior notice to you. Expensify reserves the right to revoke your access to and use of the Expensify Service or to terminate any Statement of Work at any time, with or without cause. In the event Expensify terminates these Terms of Service for your breach, you will remain liable for any and all amounts due hereunder and you authorize Expensify to charge any payment method on record to pay for such outstanding amounts.

If you are party to a Statement of Work, you may terminate your obligations under these Terms of Service (a "**Termination for Cause**") in the event Expensify fails to perform or observe any material term or condition under these Terms of Service and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach.

Furthermore, while Expensify strives to support a multitude of business and organization types, in certain unique situations, if Expensify cannot support Member's participation in the Payroll Service, Expensify may immediately terminate the Payroll Service upon written notice to Member.

#### 1.11 Privacy

See Expensify's [Privacy Policy](https://www.expensify.com/privacy) for information and notices concerning Expensify's collection and use of your personal information.

Pricing for use of the Travel Services is available in the Travel Terms and on the Travel Platform at the point of sale.

Members will receive confirmation if their Flag was successful, and, for those decisions that require review, Expensify will inform them of the enforcement decision (whether their Flag was upheld or rejected). Reporters will remain anonymous in all cases except for Expensify Chats that are direct messages and receive a Flag, where anonymity would be impossible.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Expensify, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Expensify Service, or your violation of these Terms of Service, including without limitation any breach of any representations or warranties herein, any infringement by you of Expensify's intellectual property rights, your violation of the NACHA Rules, any claim by a third party that the Member Data or Corporate Member Art infringes such third party's intellectual property rights, any claim or liability resulting from your failure to notify us of a change in the information you have provided, including any claim or liability under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227, et seq., or similar state or federal laws, and any regulations promulgated thereunder resulting from us attempting to contact you at the mobile telephone number you provided.

Expensify will defend, indemnify and hold you (and in the case of a Corporate Member, your directors, officers, employees and affiliates) harmless from and against any and all costs, liabilities, losses and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees), resulting from any claim, suit, action or proceeding alleging that the Expensify Service or any portion thereof infringes any patent, copyright or other intellectual property, proprietary, or other right of any third party.

#### 8.4 Limitation of Liability

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE EXPENSIFY SERVICE AND SITE CONTENT REMAINS WITH YOU. EXCEPT FOR THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SYSTEM FAILURE OR NETWORK OUTAGE, WILL EITHER EXPENSIFY OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE EXPENSIFY SERVICE OR SITE CONTENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, EXPENSIFY SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR EXPENSIFY SERVICE, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL OR BODILY INJURY OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF EXPENSIFY SERVICE OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE EXPENSIFY SERVICE OR SITE CONTENT, OR FROM ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE EXPENSIFY SERVICE OR OTHER PERSONS WITH WHOM YOU COMMUNICATE OR INTERACT AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE EXPENSIFY SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT EXPENSIFY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

EXCEPT FOR THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN, IN NO EVENT WILL EXPENSIFY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE EXPENSIFY SERVICE OR SITE CONTENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO EXPENSIFY FOR USE OF THE EXPENSIFY SERVICE OR SITE CONTENT. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN EXPENSIFY AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### 9\. Dispute Resolution.

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND EXPENSIFY CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND EXPENSIFY TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.**

You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to your use of the Site, the Terms of Service, or the Expensify Service, you will contact us at [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com) and you and Expensify will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for 30 days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery), such matter will be deemed a "**Dispute**" as defined below. Except for the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief described under the "**Binding Arbitration**" section below, should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys' fees, even if you may have been entitled to them otherwise.

#### 9.1 Binding Arbitration

You and Expensify agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Site, the Terms of Service or your use of the Expensify Service including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitration (collectively "**Disputes**") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights or other provisional relief as specified in the Expensify Corporate Card Program Terms or ACH Terms if you opt into, are enrolled in, or otherwise use these programs. This means that you and Expensify both agree to waive the right to a trial by jury. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring a claim against Expensify in "**small claims**" court, instead of by arbitration, but only if the claim is eligible under the rules of the small claims court and is brought in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis, and only for so long as it remains in the small claims court and in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis.

#### 9.2 Class Action Waiver

You and Expensify agree that any proceedings to resolve Disputes will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. This means that you and Expensify both agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class action proceeding. Further, unless you and Expensify agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of class action proceeding.

#### 9.3 Arbitration Administration and Rules

**Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of these Terms of Service to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, California before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award and other orders for interim relief may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution' section. (Please see the [JAMS Streamlined Rules and Procedures](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) or call JAMS at 1-800-352-5267).**

#### 9.4 Arbitration Process

A party who desires to initiate the arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from JAMS's roster of arbitrators with relevant experience. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 7 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with JAMS Rules.

#### 9.5 Arbitration Location and Procedure

Unless you and Expensify agree otherwise, the seat of the arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. If your claim does not exceed USD$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Expensify submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds USD$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by JAMS Rules. Subject to JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Hearings may be conducted by telephone or video conference, if requested and agreed to by the parties.

#### 9.6 Arbitrator's Decision and Governing Law

These Terms of Service and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.

The parties acknowledge that these Terms of Service evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms of Service shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16) and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will render an award within the timeframe specified in the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be consistent with the "**Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability**" section above. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.

#### 9.7 Fees

Each party's responsibility to pay the arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will depend on the circumstances of the arbitration and are set forth in the JAMS Rules.

### 10\. Communications.

If you want to join again, sign up as you did the first time and we will start sending SMS messages to you again.

In the case of the bank account validation process, Expensify, via Aircall, will always record telephone calls to your bank for bank verification for purposes of training, quality control, fraud prevention, and for Expensify's own protection. If you do not consent to the monitoring and recording of telephone calls by Expensify, your only remedy is not to engage with Expensify by means of a telephone call. If you do not consent to the monitoring and recording of the contents of your device screen by Expensify, you may decline to share your screen with Expensify when your consent is requested in the Expensify Service.

#### 11.9 General

The failure of Expensify to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Service will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Service or otherwise.
