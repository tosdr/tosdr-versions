Kurzweil Education, Inc. End-User License Agreement.
----------------------------------------------------

This is a legal agreement between you and Kurzweil Education, Inc. for itself and its affiliates (collectively, "Kurzweil Education, Inc."). By opening the sealed software package and/or by using the software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not agree to the terms of this License, promptly return the unopened software package and all of its accompanying items to Kurzweil Education, Inc.. for a full product refund, less shipping charges.

1. Grant of License. This Kurzweil Education, Inc. License Agreement ("License") permits you to use the software package enclosed with the License ("Software Package") for your internal purposes only. The Software Package includes computer software ("Software"), user manuals and instructions ("Documentation"). This is a non-exclusive License, without the right to assign or sublicense. If this is a License for Software relating to Kurzweil 3000 'Standalone' or Kurzweil 1000, you may install and use the Software on any single computer that is running a validly licensed operating system. Standalone licenses of Kurzweil 1000 and Kurzweil 3000 containing an individual, non-volume serial number for use by a/the primary user of the program software on a/the computer on which the Software is installed may install a second copy of the Software for his or her exclusive use on one additional computer. Since permission to install the Software on a second computer is intended solely as a convenience to the primary user/you, and not as an extension of the License to additional users, you may only use one (1) installation at a time. Concurrent use on two (2) or more computers is not authorized without the advance written consent of Kurzweil Education, Inc. and the payment of additional license fees. If you own multiple Standalone licenses indicated by a volume serial number (serial#-xy), then at any time, you may have as many copies of the Software installed use as you have valid licenses indicated by (-xy). Second installations of Standalone licenses purchased in volume are strictly prohibited. In the case of a Software Package designated as a "Network" version, you may install the Software on an unlimited number of computers within a network; however, the number of users simultaneously operating the Software at any given time is strictly limited to the number of licenses purchased. In the case of a Software Package designated as a "Web License Subscription" version, you may install the Software on an unlimited number of computers; the number of licenses available for use will vary by subscription type, though they may be used anywhere our Web License Software is installed. In the case of Per User licensing, only students rostered in the user management system and teachers/administrators/faculty may use the Software; licenses are strictly limited by the number of licenses that are purchased. For Per User licensing, each license is assigned to a specific student. For Site Licenses, software usage is strictly limited to any faculty or student currently employed by or enrolled with the stated site/institution. All other rights and limitations in this License apply uniformly to all versions of Kurzweil Education, Inc. software. For District Licenses, software usage is strictly limited to any faculty or student currently employed by or enrolled with the identified district. For Disabled Student Services implementations (U.S. only), only students who are actively serviced by a college or university's Disabled Student Services office (or any office serving students with a disability) and identified support staff personnel may be licensed for product use.
2. Kurzweil Education, Inc.' Rights. You acknowledge that the Software Package consists of proprietary products of Kurzweil Education, Inc., protected under U.S. copyright law and trade secret laws of general applicability, as well as other laws. You further acknowledge and agree that all right, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation are and shall remain the property of Kurzweil Education, Inc.. This License does not convey to you an interest in or to the Software or Documentation, but only a limited right of use, revocable in accordance with the terms of this License.
3. Term. This License is effective upon your first use of the Software or Documentation, and shall continue until terminated. You may terminate this License at any time by returning the Software Package to Kurzweil Education, Inc..
4. Software Transfer. You may permanently transfer all rights under this License, provided you retain no copies, transfer all of the Software Package (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades \[see Section 5 below\], and this License), and the recipient agrees to the terms of this License. If the Software Package is an upgrade, any transfer must include all prior versions.
5. Upgrades. If the Software Package is labeled as an upgrade, you must be properly licensed to use a product identified by Kurzweil Education, Inc. as being eligible for the upgrade in order to use the Software Package. A Software Package labeled as an upgrade replaces and/or supplements any product that formed the basis for your eligibility for the upgrade. **All software and licenses that formed the basis for upgrade are to be destroyed. By installing the upgrade Software Package you are agreeing that all of the older software and licenses (i.e. those which have been upgraded) have been fully removed from your systems. Any future use of the older software or licenses will be deemed a violation of this License Agreement and pursued through appropriate legal channels to resolution.** You may use the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this License. If the Software Package is an upgrade of a component of a package of software programs that you licensed as a single product, the Software Package may be used and transferred only as a part of that single product package and may not be separated for use on more than one computer. Customers purchasing new licenses of Kurzweil 1000/3000 in the 90 days preceding the release of a new version of Kurzweil 1000/3000 will receive the updated version of Kurzweil 1000/3000 at no charge.
6. Other Restrictions. This License is your proof of a non-exclusive license to exercise the rights granted herein and must be retained by you (or its transferee under Section 4). You may not rent, lease, lend, or otherwise commercialize the Software Package, or the Software or Documentation, in any manner. You may not reverse engineer, reverse compile/decompile, disassemble or decompose the Software, except to the extent that the foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.
