| Keep frames  <br>Last update : 2003-06-18 11:08:27  <br>  <br>The site can not break out of the frames used when surfing with TradeVisits. This is very annoying for the users of the site. This will get your account deleted. |
| Popup windows  <br>Last update : 2003-06-18 11:08:07  <br>  <br>Your site can have a maximum of one popup window because they are annoying for users of the service. Note sites also cannot generate additional popups once a popup is closed. Again a MAXIMUM ONE POPUP per site. Preferably don't have any popup windows on your site at all. That makes your visitors more happy. Note often people will leave a site just by seeing a popup window.  <br>  <br>The one popup include any popups on the site, popups, popins and exit ads. And new window opened without the user clicking anything is a popup. Even if opened in the same browser window. |

| English site only!  <br>Last update : 2001-07-08 00:00:00  <br>  <br>We will only accept sites written in the english language. This is because many members have demanded it. And to have more people understand what it on the sites thay visit. |
