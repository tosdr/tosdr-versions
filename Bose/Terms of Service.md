[E-SIGN disclosure and agreement](#E-SIGN_disclosure_and_agreement) [Opt in](#Opt_in) [Opt out](#Opt_out) [Charges](#Charges) [Eligibility and change in phone number](#Eligibility_and_change_in_phone_number) [Changes to the SMS Terms](#Changes_to_the_SMS_Terms) [Questions](#Questions)

[**BACK TO ALL LEGAL**](https://www.bose.com/legal)

By enrolling or otherwise agreeing to receive text messages from or on behalf of Bose or by otherwise providing your phone number to Bose, you agree to these SMS Terms (the “SMS Terms”), as well as Bose’s [Terms of Use](https://www.bose.com/legal/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.bose.com/legal/privacy-policy) which are incorporated herein by reference and can be viewed at the links provided here. The SMS Terms govern the provision and delivery of text messages by Bose (collectively “Bose,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and our text message service providers.

E-SIGN disclosure and agreement

By providing your consent, you also consent to the use of an electronic record to document your agreement. You may withdraw your consent to the use of the electronic record by emailing us at [privacyandsecurity@bose.com](mailto:privacyandsecurity@bose.com) with “Revoke Electronic Consent” in the subject line. These SMS Terms will still apply if you withdraw consent to the use of an electronic record. To view and retain a copy of this disclosure or any information regarding your enrollment in this program, you will need a device (such as a computer or mobile phone) with a web browser and internet access and (ii) either a printer or storage space on such device. For a free printed copy, or to update our records with your contact information, email us at [privacyandsecurity@bose.com](mailto:privacyandsecurity@bose.com) with contact information and the address for delivery.

Opt in

By opting into any Bose text messaging program, you expressly consent to receive transactional, operational, informational, and recurring marketing text messages that may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system, by or on behalf of Bose, at the cell phone number you provide us. The number of text messages that you receive will vary depending on which Bose text messaging programs you sign up for. Consent to receive marketing texts is not a condition of purchasing any goods or services. We may not be able to deliver messages to all mobile carriers. Bose and all mobile carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.  

[Back to top](#maincontent)

Opt out

To stop receiving text messages from us, you agree to reply either **“STOP”**, **“END”**, **“CANCEL”**, or **“UNSUBSCRIBE”** to the number sending the message. After such, you may receive additional communications confirming that your request has been received and processed, and you may continue to receive text messages for a short period while we process your request. If you opt out of one Bose text messaging program, you will remain opted into other Bose text messaging programs (if applicable) unless you opt out of those programs separately. If you need further assistance, text **“HELP”** to the number sending the message, or contact Bose customer service at (800) 379-2073. After opting out of receiving text messages, you can re-enroll in any Bose text messaging program by following the instructions for that program.

Charges

Bose does not charge for text messaging programs, but message and data rates may apply both for any messages sent to you from or on behalf of Bose, as well as messages you send to us. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, contact your wireless provider.

Eligibility and change in phone number

By providing your cell phone number to Bose, you warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. You further warrant that you are the current subscriber for that number or that you are authorized to receive texts to that phone number. If you change, forfeit, or deactivate the phone number you have provided to Bose, you agree to notify Bose immediately.
