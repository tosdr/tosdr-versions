Introduction

At Bose, we respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship that we have with you. This Cookies Notice explains how we use cookies and other similar technology to recognize you when you visit our websites that link to this Cookies Notice (the “Site”). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

When we use the terms “Bose,” “we,” or “us” in this Cookies Notice, we’re referring to the Bose family of companies, which means Bose Corporation and its affiliated entities under common ownership and control. Your information is controlled by one of these entities.

What are cookies?

Cookies are text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and store certain information about Site usage. They are useful because they allow websites to recognize a user's device. They are then returned to the original website on each subsequent visit or to any other website that recognizes them.

The term “cookie” is used in this Cookies Notice in the broad sense to include all similar techniques and technologies, including web beacons and log files. For more information on these additional tools, see our “[Glossary](#Glossary)” section below.

[Back to top](#maincontent)

The information collected and reasons for collection

Cookies help us to better understand your use of our Site and, as a result, allow us, among other things, to offer our web visitors a more personalized and consistent experience such as by storing your preferences and settings and delivering content and advertising tailored to your interests.

Here are examples of the types of information that we collect through cookies:

* The number of users visiting the Site, the frequency with which the Site was viewed, the pages viewed, the clicks made on the Site, and the total duration of navigation on the Site;
* The date and time you accessed the Site or opened our emails;
* The name of the website visited prior to our Site;
* Whether you are visiting our Site for the first time or not;
* Your viewing preferences (e.g. layout, sizing preferences, language, etc.);
* Your purchases and your orders;
* Your login credentials, the type of browser used, and your IP address, so that we can identify you during your next visits to our Site.

In addition, cookies enable us to do the following:

* Enhance your user experience and customize your visit: We may use information collected during your visit to facilitate your next visit to our Site, such as by remembering your login credentials and storing your language preferences
* Customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive and that appear on the Site, whether ours or those of third parties. This involves, for example, identifying the features of our Site that interest you, recommending accessories for your Bose product, or displaying helpful information such as how to extend your product to your computer or other parts of your home
* Analyze customer trends: We compile information on our Site visits and analyze them in aggregated form. This type of study aims to identify trends among many visitors to our Site, rather than analyze the information of a particular visitor
* Assist with security and administrative functions, such as troubleshooting page load errors, and detecting irregular login behavior

Types of cookies we use

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons for our Site to operate and/or provide basic functionality to you, and we refer to these as “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience on our Site. Third parties also serve cookies through our Site for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Site and the purposes they perform are described in more detail below.

**First-party cookies**  
These cookies are created by Bose. They are, for the most part, used to allow you to browse our Site and use its features. They may also assist in analytics activities.

**Third-party cookies**  
In addition to our proprietary cookies, some third-party and affiliated companies may place cookies on your device, access them, and associate web beacons with them. These cookies enable third-party features or functionalities to be provided on or through the Site. The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits our Site and also when it visits certain other websites.

The types of first- and third-party cookies we use on the Site are:

* **Strictly necessary cookies:** These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Site and cannot be turned off. These cookies allow you to use some of the Site’s features, such as access to secure areas that require registration, setting your privacy preferences, or remembering items in your cart.
* **Functional cookies:** These cookies allow you to browse our Site or benefit from some of its enhanced features, such as memorizing language preferences or using instant messaging support. Similar to strictly necessary cookies, if these cookies are disabled, it could impact your ability to use some Site functionality, such as to set your preferences.
* **Analytics cookies:** These cookies allow us or our third-party analytics providers to collect information and statistics on the use of the Site by you and other visitors. Thanks to this information, Bose is able to improve the features offered on our Site.
* **First-party advertising cookies:** These cookies, which are proprietary to Bose, serve advertisements on our Services that are solely related to your activities on our Services. These cookies do not collect or use information about your activities on other websites or services.
* **Third-party targeting cookies:** These cookies, provided by our third-party advertising partners, collect information about your browsing habits, as well as your preferences for products and services, on Bose's Services and third-party websites and services. This information allows Bose and our third-party advertising providers to display relevant content and advertisements on our Site and other sites you visit as you browse the web.
* **Social media cookies:** These cookies are used when information is shared through a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Sites, or when you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking site such as Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat.

To manage these various types of cookies, please follow the instructions below under the section “[Cookie management.](#Cookie_management)"

[Back to top](#maincontent)

Duration of storage of cookies on your device

The duration of storage of cookies on your device may vary, depending on the category to which they belong: temporary or permanent.

**Temporary cookies**  
We use temporary cookies on all our secure pages to assign and register a session ID. This allows you to browse our entire Site without interruption. This identifier is also used for internal reporting purposes. It does not allow us to identify you by name and this type of cookie does not leave any information recoverable on your hard drive. Most of our proprietary cookies fall into this category and expire when you close your Internet browser.

**Permanent cookies**  
Our proprietary analysis cookies and third-party cookies are permanent cookies. They allow us to understand visitors’ browsing behavior over a longer period of time or to provide you with additional features related to your Site customization requests and the content that you have saved or stored. They can stay on your computer for 24 hours, a week or several years, depending on their function. This means that these cookies survive after your browser is closed and can be used by our Site to recognize your computer when you reopen your browser later.

[Back to top](#maincontent)

Cookie management

Depending on your geographical location when you access our Site, you may be asked whether you want to accept or reject all or certain cookies when you first access our Site.

Moreover, most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences, as discussed in the “All cookies,” “Analytics cookies,” and “Targeting cookies” sections below. Please note that, depending on your geographical location when you access our Site, you may also have the option to adjust what cookies you allow us to place on your browser through our Cookies Preference Center. You can modify these settings at any time.

Please note for clarity, that the Cookies Preference Center does not manage websites for Bose Automotive. For these sites, you should follow instructions for managing cookies via your browser (below).

If you choose to disable or deactivate cookies, this may have the consequences on Site functionality discussed in the section “[Consequences of deactivation of all cookies](#Consequences_of_deactivation_of_all_cookies)” below.

**All cookies:** You can exercise your preference to receive all types of cookies by managing cookies from your web browser. As the means by which to activate or deactivate cookies varies from one web browser to another, you should visit your web browser’s help menu for more information on cookie preferences. You can also configure your browser at any time to be notified of the receipt of a cookie, so that you can decide whether you want to accept it or not. Cookies do not under any circumstances read the data from your hard drive and you can delete them from your computer at any time. At the moment, it is technically impossible for you to synchronize your settings between your browsers and your devices (e.g., your computer and your smartphone). You must adjust your settings on each browser/device that you currently use and each time you use a new browser or device.

**Analytics cookies:** To disable analytics cookies managed by our third-party analytics partners, either use the browser disablement mechanisms discussed immediately above, or use the analytics opt-out mechanisms maintained by our analytics providers:  
[Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)  
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html)  
[BazaarVoice](https://www.bazaarvoice.com/legal/privacy-policy/#opting-out)

**Targeting cookies:** If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being placed on your device to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/), or [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the [Google Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) page. You can also opt out of specific ad networks with which we partner by visiting the following links:

Consequences of deactivation of all cookies

If you choose to deactivate cookies, you may continue to use certain parts of our Site. However, some useful features may not work anymore, depending on which cookies you deactivate. For example, you will not be able to use our online chat service and the Site and its content may not be as relevant to your preferences. You will not be able to search for resellers through our tool or share pages with your social network.

Please note that if you have disabled one or more cookies, we may continue to use the information that was collected by such cookies before they were deactivated in accordance with applicable law. However, we will cease to collect any information via the opted-out cookie once a cookie has been deactivated.

Changes to our Cookies Notice

From time to time we may change or update this Cookies Notice to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, or advances in technology. You should review this Cookies Notice periodically, and check the “Effective date” at the beginning of the document to know if the Cookies Notice has changed since the last time you reviewed it.
