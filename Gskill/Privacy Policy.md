### Analyzing Tools and Trackers

### Google Analytics

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. You find more information concerning the treatment of user data by Google Analytics in Google's Privacy Policy: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409?hl=en)

In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last four numbers of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

Furthermore, you can prevent collection by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. This will install an opt-out cookie that will prevent future collection of your data on this part of the website: [Deactivate Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)

### Youtube

Our website uses plugins of the Google-operated website YouTube. Provider of the website is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. If you visit one of our website having a YouTube-plugin embedded, a connection to YouTube servers will be established. The YouTube server will then be submitted the information that you have visited our websites.

If you are logged on to your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to associate your browsing behavior with your personal profile. You may prevent this by logging out of YouTube.

### How Long Do We Keep Your Data?

We will only keep your data and information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collect it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

When we have fulfilled the purpose we collect your information for, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, your information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any processing until deletion is possible.

### How Do We Share The Information We Collect?

As part of the services offered to you through our website, the information which you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union ("EU") and the United States ("US").

If you use our services while you are outside EU, your information may be transferred outside EU and US in order to provide you with those services.

The information about you that we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Policy. Except as set forth in this Policy, we do not sell, trade, share, rent, or give away information concerning you to third parties.

### How Do We Protect Your Personal Data?

G.SKILL has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that your personal data we have collected or will collect in the future is secure.
