Except as otherwise specified in these Terms, Customer does not obtain any rights to the Site or Services, including any related intellectual property rights. ConnectWise reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms.

### 8\. Availability

Your use of this Site and/or the Service may be interrupted from time to time for any or no reason, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment; periodic updating, maintenance or repair of this Site and/or the Service or; other actions that we may take in our sole discretion and from time to time.

### 10\. Payments

**a. ConnectWise Subscriptions**

Our different subscription plans and pricing information related to access and use of the Services (each, a "Subscription") on an annual or other periodic basis can be found on our [pricing page](https://smileback.com/pricing).

**b. Continuous Subscriptions**

WHEN CUSTOMER REGISTERS FOR A SUBSCRIPTION, CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (A) CONNECTWISE (OR OUR THIRD PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) IS AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE CUSTOMER EVERY MONTH FROM THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE OR OTHER PERIODIC BASIS (AS SELECTED BY CUSTOMER VIA THE SERVICES) FOR CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION (IN ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION CONTINUES, AND (B) CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION IS CONTINUOUS UNTIL CUSTOMER CANCELS IT OR CONNECTWISE SUSPENDS OR STOPS PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

**c. Cancellation**

You may cancel your Subscription at any time by logging into your account on the Site and following the instructions to cancel. Your cancellation is effective at the end of the current Subscription term (billing period). Once you cancel your account and Subscription, the Customer Data you have uploaded to the Site or Service will only be available or accessible for a period of up to 30 days. You have the right during this 30 day period to request us to return (or make available for download) or delete your Customer Data. After expiry of this 30 day period we shall delete your Customer Data in any event, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the DPA. You will remain responsible for all charges (including applicable taxes and other charged) incurred with respect to fees processed prior to the cancellation of your Subscription. We do not provide refunds if you decide to stop using the Service during your current Subscription term.

**d. Free or Promotional Trials**

From time to time, to the extent legally permitted, ConnectWise may offer free or reduced rate promotional trials of certain Subscriptions for specified periods of time without payment or for a reduced promotional price. If ConnectWise offers Customer a free or promotional trial, the specific terms of the free or promotional trial will be provided in the marketing materials describing the particular trial, during the online registration process when the code for the trial is entered on the Site.

ONCE THE FREE OR PROMOTIONAL TRIAL ENDS, CUSTOMER AUTHORIZES CONNECTWISE (OR OUR THIRD PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) TO BEGIN CHARGING CUSTOMER'S DESIGNATED PAYMENT METHOD ON A RECURRING BASIS FOR CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION (PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS THE SUBSCRIPTION CONTINUES, UNLESS CUSTOMER CANCELS THE SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FREE OR PROMOTIONAL TRIAL OR OTHERWISE CANCELS THE SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION. INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANCELING CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION ARE DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS 9(b) AND 9(c) ABOVE.

**e. Pricing and Availability**

All prices are shown in U.S. dollars and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, are additional. ConnectWise reserves the right to adjust prices as ConnectWise may determine in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice; provided, however, that if ConnectWise changes the amounts or other charges associated with Customer's Subscription, ConnectWise will use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of such changes in accordance with this Section. ConnectWise will not, however, be required to notify Customer of changes in any applicable taxes. The Service, Site and Subscriptions are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or part of an order, or to discontinue offering certain Services or Subscriptions without prior notice, even if Customer has already placed an order.

**f. Payment and Billing Information**

By providing a payment method that ConnectWise accepts, Customer represents and warrants that Customer is authorized to use the designated payment method and that Customer permits ConnectWise (or our third party payment processor) to charge Customer's payment method for the total amount of Customer's Subscription or other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, Customer's order or Subscription may be suspended or cancelled. Customer must resolve any problem ConnectWise encounters in order to proceed with Customer's order. In the event Customer wants to change or update payment information associated with Customer's account, Customer can do so by logging into the Services and editing the payment information. Customer acknowledges that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, changes to your Subscription or changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and Customer authorizes ConnectWise (or our third party payment processor) to charge Customer's payment method for the corresponding amount.

**g. Taxes**

Customer is responsible for any sales, duty or other governmental taxes or fees due with respect to Customer's purchase of a Subscription. ConnectWise will collect applicable sales tax if it determines that ConnectWise has a duty to collect sales tax. ConnectWise will present any taxes that it is required to collect at checkout, but note that actual taxes charged may be adjusted from the amount shown at checkout. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates.

**h. Non-payment and late fees**

In the event of non-payment, ConnectWise will have the right, with or without notice, to suspend or immediately terminate your access to the Service. We may determine whether or not to reinstate your access to the Service upon receipt of payment in full of all sums owed. Any payment not received by ConnectWise on or before thirty (30) days following the due date shall automatically be assessed a late payment fee equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum allowed by applicable law; or (ii) the greater of ten (10%) percent or $50. Any payment not received by ConnectWise on or before thirty (30) days following the due date shall also bear interest from the due date until paid in full at the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. If ConnectWise is required to use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable cost of collection. These collection costs include, but are not limited to, any collection agency's fees, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.

**i. Disputed charges**

Subject to applicable law, if you intend to dispute a charge or request a credit, you must contact ConnectWise in writing within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. You hereby waive any right to dispute a charge or receive a credit for a charge that you do not report within thirty (30) days of the date on the applicable invoice. To dispute an invoice, you must send ConnectWise a written itemized description of the specific items you dispute as contained in such invoice. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to timely resolve billing disputes.

### 18\. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CONNECTWISE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY—WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE—FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF CONNECTWISE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 20\. Dispute resolution

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with ConnectWise and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

Except for small claims disputes in which you or ConnectWise seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or ConnectWise seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and ConnectWise waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service or Site resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, our Service or Site will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in New Castle County, Delaware in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and ConnectWise agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service or Site is personal to you and ConnectWise and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

You and ConnectWise agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. If you are an individual, you and ConnectWise agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and ConnectWise will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. You and ConnectWise agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

ANY CLAIM BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SITE OR SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.

### 21\. Governing law, jurisdiction and venue

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida, without reference to its choice of law principles to the contrary. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. For any action to compel arbitration or enforce an arbitration award or seek injunctive relief pursuant to these Terms, the parties hereby expressly consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and/or federal courts in and/or for Hillsborough County, Florida, USA, and each party hereby expressly waives any objection to such venue based upon forum non-conveniens or otherwise.

### 22\. Force majeure

Neither party shall be liable for any delay in performing its obligations if such delay is caused by circumstances beyond the party's reasonable control, including, without limitation, any delay caused by any act or omission of the other party, acts of God, war, terrorism, floods, windstorm, labor disputes, or delay of essential materials or services. The delayed party shall promptly notify the other party of the reasons for and the likely duration of the delay, whereupon an extension of time equal to the period of delay, but not greater than thirty (30) days, shall be granted to the delayed party. If the period of the delay shall exceed thirty (30) days, then the non-delayed party may cancel further performance of the delayed obligation, without any penalty whatsoever. This paragraph shall not apply to any payment obligations.

### 23\. Term and survival

Your agreement to be bound by these Terms commences with your visiting or using this Site, registering to use or using the Service, or otherwise submitting information through this Site or the Service, and your agreement to be so bound will continue until your right to use this Site and/or the Service is either canceled or terminated. The following provisions will survive cancellation or termination: Sections 1, 7, and 9 through 24. If, following the cancellation or termination of your right to use this Site and/or the Service, you visit or use this Site, register to use or use the Service, or otherwise submit information through this Site or the Service, then you again agree to be bound by these Terms.

### 24\. General information

**c. No Waiver and Enforceability**

The failure of ConnectWise to require performance of any obligation under these Terms will not affect our right to enforce any provision of these Terms at a subsequent time, and the waiver of any rights arising out of any breach will not be construed as a waiver of any rights arising out of any prior or subsequent breach.
