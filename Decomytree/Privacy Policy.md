DECO MY TREE](https://www.unboxers.team/ca0f6d63-87ef-4047-93c2-eb25c47c5131)

Deco My Tree is a web application and mobile application made by UNBOXERS Corp. that lets you share Christmas cards with your friends. When you send a message using Deco My Tree, it will appear on your friends' Tree and they will be able to read them on Christmas Day. Given that Deco My Tree is crafted for sharing moments with your dearest friends, safeguarding the privacy and security of your data is of utmost importance to us.

Below, we outline what data we collect, how we use and share it, and your rights.

### Data Collection And Use

#### Name and Email

When you sign up for an account on Deco My Tree, you are asked to enter your email and name. This data is used to identify you to other Deco My Tree users and makes it easy for your friends to find your account on the service. We may also collect your name or email address through our website so you can text yourself a link to download the app or sign up for email updates. This Account Data may also be used to respond to your messages.

#### Time and Date

When you sign up, we collect the time and date on your device so we can assign exact countdown time for Christmas Day.

#### Device Data

We collect diverse device-specific data, including BSSIDs of Wi-Fi terminals and SSIDs (the addresses of any WiFi routers you're connected to). This information is only retained temporarily for statistical purposes. Additionally, hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, phone language, wireless network names, IP addresses, and general mobile network data will be collected. This comprehensive dataset aids us in enhancing security, resolving bugs, and refining the accuracy of your location, among other improvements.

#### How We Share Data

"We do not engage in selling, renting, licensing, or leasing your data to third parties. However, we may share it with the following categories of third parties:

•

Service Providers: Such as hosting services, customer support services, and analytics services.

•

Professional Advisors: Including lawyers and accountants.

•

Business Transaction Recipients: Encompassing counterparties and others involved in activities such as mergers, acquisitions, financings, reorganizations, bankruptcies, receiverships, dissolutions, asset sales, or similar transactions related to our business.

•

Legal and Safety Entities: Government authorities, regulators, or other third parties, when mandated by law or legal processes, or to safeguard the rights and safety of Locket, users, or other third parties."

### Data Retention

We keep your data until we don’t need it for the purposes described in this policy and we have no legal obligation to keep it.

### Your Rights

We provide all users with the following rights:

Access: You have the ability to access and update most of the data we have about you, primarily through the profile section of the app. For any other data access, updates, or deletion requests, please contact us on Instagram. Note that we may require identity verification or additional information before granting access to your data.

Object: You have the right to object to our use of your data. For data essential to providing our services, deleting your account is an option to cease data processing.

Correct: Correct any inaccuracies you find in your data.

Delete: Easily delete in-app data such as messages. Deleting your account is also an option to erase your history, although some services reliant on location history may not allow a reset.

Account Deletion: While we're sad to see you go, if you wish to delete your account you can delete through the app.

Complain: you can complain to the data protection regulator where you live (if you have one).

You can exercise these rights by emailing [help@decomytree.com](mailto:help@decomytree.com). We will not treat you differently if you exercise any of these rights, but we may need additional information to verify your identity. An agent can also make these requests on your behalf, but we may still ask you to verify your identity and that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf.

### Children

Deco My Tree is designed for users aged 13 and above, and we do not intentionally gather personal information from individuals under the age of 13. If we discover that personal information has been inadvertently collected from someone under 13, we will promptly delete the information and close the individual's account. If you suspect that we may have information regarding a child under 13, kindly reach out to us using the provided contact information below.

### Changes to this Policy

We may find it necessary to revise this policy to accommodate alterations in our business operations and comply with applicable laws. In the event of any changes, the updated version will be posted here. If the modifications are significant, we will also notify you through the app.
