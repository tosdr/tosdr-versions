* Data automatically collected: We and our third-party partners automatically collect information you provide to us and information about how you access and use our Sites, Applications, products or other services when you visit our services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us.

**7\. International Transfer of Personal Data**

Because of the international nature of our business, we transfer Personal Data within the Anker group, and to third parties as noted in [Section (6)](#6) above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. For this reason, we transfer Personal Data to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements than those that apply in the country in which you are located, including China, the EEA, the UK, and the US.

In the event of a transfer by Anker, we ensure that international transfers of your Personal Data are made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as:

1. Ensuring that the Personal Data is only transferred to countries recognized as Adequate Jurisdictions. The current adequacy decisions can be found here. There is currently no adequacy decision for the United States and China; or
    
2. the transfer is made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission or UK Secretary of State (as applicable) in connection with appropriate supplementary measures. The decision and the template text of these Standard Contractual Clauses can be found [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en);
    

If you wish to enquire further about these safeguards, including the specific contracts entered into, used, please contact us using the details set out under [Section (14)](#14) of this Privacy Notice.

Please note that when you transfer any Personal Data directly to any Anker entity established outside the UK, Switzerland, or the EEA (as applicable), this is considered a direct collection, to which the safeguards mentioned in this [Section (7)](#7) may not apply. We will nevertheless Process your Personal Data, from the point at which we receive those data, in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.

**8\. Data Retention**

We have implemented processes designed to ensure that your Personal Data are only processed for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. The criteria for determining the duration for which we will retain your Personal Data are as follows:

|     |
| --- |
| 1. we will retain Personal Data in a form that permits identification only for as long as: |
| (a) we maintain an ongoing relationship with you (e.g., where you are a user of our services, or you are lawfully included in our mailing list and have not unsubscribed); or |
| (b) your Personal Data are necessary in connection with the lawful purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, for which we have a valid legal basis (e.g., where your Personal Data are included in a contract between you and us, and we have a legitimate interest in Processing those Personal Data for the purposes of operating our business and fulfilling our obligations under that contract; or where we have a legal obligation to retain your Personal Data), |
| 1. the duration of: |
| (a) any applicable limitation period under applicable law (i.e., either any statutory retention periods as required by the law of the European Union or a member state of the EEA, or any period during which any person could bring a legal claim against us in connection with your Personal Data, or to which your Personal Data are relevant); and |
| (b) an additional two (2) month period following the end of such applicable limitation period (so that, if a person brings a claim at the end of the limitation period, we are still afforded a reasonable amount of time in which to identify any Personal Data that are relevant to that claim), |
| 1. in addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we continue to Process Personal Data for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim. |

During the periods noted in paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) above, we will restrict our Processing of your Personal Data to storage of, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent that those data need to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim, or any obligation under applicable law.

Once the periods in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above, each to the extent applicable, have concluded, we will either:

* permanently delete or destroy the Relevant Personal Data; or
    
* anonymize or deidentify the Relevant Personal Data.
    

**9\. Your Privacy Rights**

Subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights regarding the Processing of your Relevant Personal Data:

* the right not to provide your Personal Data to us (however, please note that we may be unable to provide you with the full benefit of our services, if you do not provide us with your Personal Data – e.g., we might not be able to process your requests without the necessary details);
    
* the right to request access to, or copies of, your Relevant Personal Data, together with additional information, such as information regarding the nature, Processing and disclosure of those Relevant Personal Data;
    
* the right to request rectification of any inaccuracies or incompleteness in your Relevant Personal Data;

* the right to request the deletion or removal of your Relevant Personal Data where there is no other legal basis for us to keep using it. Please note that we may not be able to immediately remove the information from the backup system due to applicable laws and regulations or technological limitations. If this is the case, we will isolate your Relevant Personal Data from further processing until the backup can be deleted or be anonymized / deidentified .
    
* where we Process your Relevant Personal Data on the basis of your consent, the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Data in reliance upon any other available legal bases).
    

**Under the** **GDPR** **, you may also have the following additional rights regarding the Processing of your Relevant Personal Data:**

* **the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the Processing of your Relevant Personal Data by us or on our behalf, where such processing is based on Articles 6(1)(e) (public interest) or 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) of the** **GDPR****;**
    
* **the right to object to the Processing of your Relevant Personal Data by us or on our behalf for direct marketing purposes；and**
    
* **the right to lodge complaints regarding the Processing of your Relevant Personal Data with a competent Data Protection Authority (in particular, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, or the Data Protection Authority of the EU Member State in which you live, or in which you work, or in which the alleged infringement occurred. If you live in Germany, the relevant Data Protection Authority is the "Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht", Promenade 18, 91522 Ansbach). However, we encourage you to first contact us so that we can together solve any concerns you may have.**
    

This does not affect your statutory rights.

To exercise one or more of these rights, or to ask a question about these rights or any other provision of this Privacy Notice, or about our Processing of your Personal Data, please use the contact details provided in [Section (14)](#14) below. Please note that:

* in some cases it will be necessary to provide evidence of your identity before we can give effect to these rights; and
    
* where your request requires the establishment of additional facts (e.g., a determination of whether any Processing is non-compliant with applicable law) we will investigate your request reasonably promptly, before deciding what action to take.

**Annex 2 Details of Product-specific information**

* _**Customer content**_: including any files, documents, audio, videos, images, data, or communications you choose to input, upload, or transmit to our Sites, Applications, products and services. In addition, certain of our Sites, Applications, products, and services may allow you to collect or process additional customer content directly on your device without transferring such content back to Anker. For example, you may generate voice prompts when you use one of our voice-assisted technologies, such as our smart speakers, and transfer your voice prompts to your third-party voice-assistant service account (such as Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant) as a command. We may also enable you to collect images and video through certain of our products, such as the Roav Dash Cam and eufy security cameras. Note that depending on where you live, the surveillance laws in effect in your jurisdiction, and how you configure our services, you may need to obtain explicit consent from individuals before using our products to create and save video or images of them or provide notice informing visitors to your home that our products or services are in use. It is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with all such applicable laws.
    
* _**Entertainment-related service information**_: when you use our entertainment-related services, include our Nebula Smart Projectors and SoundCore speakers and headphones, we collect information about your entertainment preferences, including audio / video settings, and the entertainment services you like to engage with. With your permission, we will also read call status for the SoundCore music player so that music played before a call can be paused and resumed after the call ends. With your permission, the SoundCore app may also seek permission to access your mobile device’s microphone to enable you to take advantage of certain speech-based speaker / headphone features. You may refuse or withdraw your permission at any time through the privacy settings of your mobile device.
    
* _**Home-related services information**_: when you use our home-related services, including eufy Clean, eufy Pet and eufy Security, we collect information about your home and your activities around your home, including the location of your home, home environment data (such as level of dirt, smart device movement, floorplans and room names, existence and types of objects within the home, and floor type), pet information (such as pet type and activity), home occupancy data (such as the presence or absence of individuals within your home zone or specific areas of your home at any given time), home monitoring audio, images and videos (such as alerts triggered by your home security system). Note that depending on where you live, the surveillance laws in effect in your jurisdiction, and how you configure our services, you may need to obtain explicit consent from individuals before using our products to create and save video or images of them or provide notice informing visitors to your home that our products or services are in use. It is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with all such applicable laws.
    
* _**Car-related services information**_: when you use our car-related services, including Roav DashCam, SmartCharge and Viva, information about your vehicle, such as the first nine digits of your VIN to confirm your vehicle’s make, model and year, and your driving experience, including the precise location of your vehicle, engine start/stop and idle times, your vehicle’s speed, braking and acceleration metrics, and your driving route, are collected locally on your device and/or mobile application.
    
* _**Baby-related services information**_: when you use our baby-related services, including the eufy Baby Monitor and Smart Sock, we collect information that you choose to share about your baby, including your baby’s name, gender, due date or date of birth, weight, photographs, monitor images and video, and, when using the eufy Smart Sock, sleep patterns, nap patterns, movements, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels.
    
* _**Health-related services information**_: when you use our health-related services, including the eufy Smart Scale, eufy Blood Pressure Monitor, and SoundCore health-connected devices, information that you choose to track in relation to your personal health, including weight, height, body mass index, body fat percentage, muscle mass, heartrate, water content, basal metabolic rate, visceral fat, lean body mass, body fat, bone mass, body age, protein, subcutaneous fat percentage, body type, skeletal muscle mass, blood pressure, blood oxygen, posture, calories burned, duration of exercise, and sleep metrics, such as estimated sleep time through real-time monitoring of sleep environment sound (though we will not store the underlying sound file), are collected by us or are otherwise maintained locally on your device and/or mobile application.
    
* _**Biometric services information**_: certain of our services leverage biometric technologies (such as facial recognition tools) when a user chooses to turn on biometric-related features, such as face images and underlying face prints. In particular, we may provide you the ability to (i) log in to our Applications or authenticate yourself using facial, fingerprint or other biometric recognition technology available through your mobile device, or (ii) leverage facial recognition technology on your eligible eufy device to determine whether an individual in the device’s field of vision is a “familiar face” or a stranger. We do not store or have access to this biometric information. Instead, the applicable biometric assessment process is conducted entirely on your device. We may, however, receive confirmation of the results of the biometric assessment, such as in the form of a token from your mobile device indicating you successfully authenticated using biometric recognition technology or an alert attached to your security account indicating your camera saw a “familiar face” or a stranger. Depending on where you live, the laws in effect in your jurisdiction, and how you configure our services, you may need to obtain explicit consent from individuals before using our products to create, save and analyze video or photographic images of them (including to conduct biometric processing of their images) or provide notice informing visitors to your home that our products or services are in use. It is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with all such applicable laws.
