At Paul Pierce Photography, we are dedicated to keeping your interactions with us and on our site between you and us in each instance that we can. With that said, there are some instances where we must share your information with third parties in order to do business with you.

What do we collect?
-------------------

In the normal course of visiting this website, we use cookies to help navigate our pages and provide a more efficient user experience.

At this time, we do not currently track our users via any analytic tools.

We use Google's reCAPTCHA service to prevent spam emails on our service, but we only use it to the minimum requirements to send email. Google recommends that reCAPTCHA be tagged on all pages of a website to help better track users, but this is a position that we reject for your privacy. It may mean that you are required to verify that you are not a robot every time you send an email to us via our contact page, but we think your privacy is worth the small inconvenience.

Information that you may provide voluntarily.
---------------------------------------------

Personal Information: You may provide your name, address, email address, phone number and other information via our contact feature solely at your discretion and we will protect it as best we can protect unencrypted email. To ensure that you are not put at greater risk than you like, do not include any information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or any other personal information that may be used to steal your identity or harm you in any other way. If you provide any such information, we cannot guarantee its safety and will not be responsible if it is intercepted or stolen by third parties. If we notice that an email with such information has come into our servers, we will delete it, but do not guarantee that unless you contact us. It may still have some residual digital footprint as servers are constantly backed up by our service providers.

If you accidentally provide too much personal information and would like it removed from our servers to the extent possible, please contact us via our contact form or at paul@paulpiercephotography.com with the subject “REMOVE PII” and we will follow up to remove your information.

Payment Information: Our website does not currently accept payments of any kind so please do not include payment information in any form on our site.

To comply with all lawful, law enforcement activities.

Information that you share with us will only be shared with those that must know it, such as our email providers, payment processing providers, shipping companies, and other companies as required to provide our services to you, but only what is absolutely necessary to do business.
