**Digital Millennium Copyright Act**

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by COMPANY infringe your copyright, you, or your agent may send to COMPANY a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it be blocked.

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to COMPANY a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. COMPANY's Copyright Agent for notice shall be [support@purehealthresearch.com](mailto:support@purehealthresearch.com).

**Dispute Resolution**

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and any dispute shall be subject to binding arbitration by NAM (National Arbitration and Mediation) in Prince William County, Virginia. If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The parties agree that any arbitration is subject to these Terms of Use and not any prior arbitration agreement.

**Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure**

These procedures are intended to increase the likelihood of prompt and low-cost resolutions to any dispute between the parties. All the requirements of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure are jurisdictional in nature.

* Before a party commences an arbitration with NAM with respect to a claim, the party must first send a written notice of dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or FedEx; (2) be addressed to: PureHealth Research, LLC, 10199 Dean Drive Manassas, VA 20110; (3) contain the party’s name, address, email address and date/time of website visit; (4) include a short summary of the dispute, including any relevant facts regarding the use of the Products with specific relief sought.
* The party must attend a video conference to discuss the dispute with a representative from Impact Brands. The party’s attorney may be present.
* Impact Brands then shall have 45 days from the date of the video conference to analyze the nature of the dispute before the filing of an arbitration with NAM by the party.
* If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, NAM Arbitration Practice Administrator/Case Manager must dismiss any arbitration claims brought by a party that has failed to follow the required steps in the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If the arbitration is already pending prior to the completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Information Dispute Resolution Procedure, NAM cannot accept any fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of Impact Brands to seek damages for non-compliance with the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in arbitration.
* If after the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure has been completed, any claim or dispute arising from use of the Products shall be settled only through binding arbitration. Any complaint or lawsuit filed in a court of law shall be dismissed and the arbitration shall commence. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of Impact Brands to seek damages if a party files a complaint or lawsuit.

**Class Action Waiver**

You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.

The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless all relevant parties specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.

**Severability**

If any clause within these Terms of Service (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from these Terms of Service, and the remainder of these Terms of Service will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.
