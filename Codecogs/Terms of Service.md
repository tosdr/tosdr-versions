### 18\. General Information

The TOU constitute the entire agreement between you and CodeCogs and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and CodeCogs. The TOU and the relationship between you and CodeCogs shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and CodeCogs agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Francisco, California. The failure of CodeCogs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

### 19\. Violation of Terms and Liquidated Damages

Please report any violations of the TOU, by flagging the modules(s) for review, or by contact us at: [**CodeCogs Abuse**](https://codecogs.com/pages/email/sendmail.php?cc=2)

Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for CodeCogs to pursue legal action to enforce the TOU, you will be liable to pay CodeCogs the following amounts as liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of CodeCogs' damages for the specified breaches of the TOU:

a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity; (2) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay CodeCogs five hundred pounds (£500) for each such message. This provision does not apply to messages that are lawful non-deceptive parodies of public figures.

b. If CodeCogs establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay CodeCogs one hundred pounds (£100) for each message posted in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access CodeCogs in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.

c. If you send unsolicited email advertisements to CodeCogs email addresses or through CodeCogs computer systems, you agree to pay CodeCogs twenty five pounds (£25) for each such email.

d. If you post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described above, you agree to pay CodeCogs one hundred pounds (£100) for each item of Content posted. In its sole discretion, CodeCogs may elect to issue a warning before assessing damages.

e. If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the TOU, in addition to any liquidated damages under clause (d), you agree to pay CodeCogs one hundred pounds (£100) for each and every Item of Conent posted in violation of the TOU. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the "Principal"), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of the TOU) agrees to pay CodeCogs an additional one hundred pounds (£100) for each Item of Content posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the principal in violation of the TOU.

f. If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of the TOU without CodeCogs's express written permission, you agree to pay CodeCogs two thousand pounds (£2,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct.

Otherwise, you agree to pay CodeCogs's actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Not withstanding any other provision of the TOU, CodeCogs retains the right to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained in the TOU, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the TOU, or any combination thereof.
