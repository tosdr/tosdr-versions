Policy Evaluation
-----------------

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 will evaluate this policy's compact policy whenever it is used with a cookie. The actions IE will take depend on what privacy level the user has selected in their browser (Low, Medium, Medium High, or High; the default is Medium. In addition, IE will examine whether the cookie's policy is considered satisfactory or unsatisfactory, whether the cookie is a session cookie or a persistent cookie, and whether the cookie is used in a first-party or third-party context. This section will attempt to evaluate this policy's compact policy against Microsoft's stated behavior for IE6.

**Note:** this evaluation is currently experimental and should not be considered a substitute for testing with a real Web browser.

**Unsatisfactory policy**: this compact policy is considered _unsatisfactory_ according to the rules defined by Internet Explorer 6. The behavior of Internet Explorer 6 regarding cookies set under this compact policy is as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | **First-party usage** | **Third-party usage** |
| **Persistent Cookies** | * **Low:** Policy satisfactory at this level; cookies will be accepted.<br>* **Medium:** Opt-out is not provided for all unsatisfactory purposes and recipients, so the cookie will be **downgraded** to a session cookie.<br>* **Medium High:** No opt-out is provided, so the cookie will be **blocked**.<br>* **High:** Since opt-in is not required, the cookie will be **blocked**. | * **Low:** Opt-out is not provided for all unsatisfactory purposes and recipients, so the cookie will be **downgraded** to a session cookie.<br>* **Medium:** Opt-out is not provided for all unsatisfactory purposes and recipients, so the cookie will be **blocked**.<br>* **Medium High:** Since opt-in is not required, the cookie will be **blocked**.<br>* **High:** Since opt-in is not required, the cookie will be **blocked**. |
| **Session Cookies** | * **Low:** Policy satisfactory at this level; cookies will be accepted.<br>* **Medium:** Policy satisfactory at this level; cookies will be accepted.<br>* **Medium High:** Policy satisfactory at this level; cookies will be accepted.<br>* **High:** Since opt-in is not required, the cookie will be **blocked**. | * **Low:** Policy satisfactory at this level; cookies will be accepted.<br>* **Medium:** Opt-out is not provided for all unsatisfactory purposes and recipients, so the cookie will be **blocked**.<br>* **Medium High:** Since opt-in is not required, the cookie will be **blocked**.<br>* **High:** Since opt-in is not required, the cookie will be **blocked**. |

A policy which is considered unsatisfactory by Internet Explorer 6 contains certain categories of data which are used or shared in a particular manner. This policy is placed in the unsatisfactory category, because the following categories of data are associated with this policy's cookies:

* Physical contact information is collected.
* Online contact information is collected.

In addition, the data is used in the following manner, marking the policy as unsatisfactory:

* The data is used for contacting the user.
* The data is used for analysis, including knowledge of the visitor's identity.
* The data is used for decision-making, including knowledge of the visitor's identity.

Note that allowing an opt-out will make this policy acceptable under the Low and Medium settings, and under Medium High for first-party cookie usage. At the High setting, and at the Medium High setting for third-party cookies, all of these data uses must be opt-in for the policy to be considered satisfactory.
