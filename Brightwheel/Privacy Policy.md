==============

**LAST UPDATED: April 15, 2024**

We take your privacy and personal information seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the brightwheel Services in any manner, you acknowledge the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. Remember that your use of brightwheel’s Services is at all times subject to the [Terms of Use](https://mybrightwheel.com/terms/), which incorporates this Privacy Policy. 

**What does this Privacy Policy cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personal information defined under applicable privacy laws (“Personal Information”) that we process when you are accessing or using brighthweel’s websites, apps, platforms, or other online or offline offerings, including Experience Early Learning branded curriculum tools (the “Services”). 

**California Supplemental Notice**. If you are a resident of California, click [here](https://mybrightwheel.com/privacy-ccpa/) to review our Supplemental Notice for California Residents.

**An Important Note**. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the Personal Information that we process on behalf of our customers (schools and school administrators) through their use of our Services (“Customer Data”). Our customers’ respective privacy policies govern their collection and use of Customer Data. Our processing of Customer Data is governed by the contracts that we have in place with our customers, not this Privacy Policy. Any questions or requests relating to Customer Data e.g., requests to delete information about your child on the brightwheel platform should be directed to our customer i.e., your child’s school or school administrator. 

**Will brightwheel ever change this Privacy Policy?**

We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will do our best to alert you to changes by placing a notice on [mybrightwheel.com](https://mybrightwheel.com/), by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if we aren’t able to send a notification or if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), you are still responsible for reading and understanding the changes. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. 

**Children’s Information**. The Services are not directed to children under 16 (or other age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children If you believe that a child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us at [info@mybrightwheel.com](mailto:info@mybrightwheel.com).

**Is Personal Information about me secure?**

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately.

**What Personal Information can I access?**

Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the information you’ve provided to us, such as email, password, and contact information. The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at [info@mybrightwheel.com](mailto:info@mybrightwheel.com).

**International transfers of Personal Information**

All Personal Information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. 

If we transfer Personal Information which originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en). 

For more information about the safeguards we use for international transfers of your Personal Information, please contact us at info@mybrightwheel.com. 

**How long will you store my Personal Information?**

We store the Personal Information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services, or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.  

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, certain risk factors, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.

**What rights do I have?** 

In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to:

* **Confirm Whether We Are Processing Your Personal Information** (the right to know); 
* **Access to and Portability of Your Personal Information**, including: (i) obtaining access to or a copy of your Personal Information; and (ii) receiving an electronic copy of Personal Information that you have provided to us, or asking us to send that information to another company in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable format (also known as the “right of data portability”);
* **Request Correction** of your Personal Information where it is inaccurate or incomplete. In some cases, we may provide self-service tools that enable you to update your Personal Information;
