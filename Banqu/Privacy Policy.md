BanQu is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.

Storage and Protection of Information

Each user has a unique encrypted and hashed data block in the blockchain that is stored indefinitely. BanQu cannot make any changes or modifications to data stored in the blockchain. BanQu also maintains a permanent, time-stamped, and geo-tagged record of every user identity and related transaction. We use physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the information we maintain, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. Upon the termination of your relationship with us, we will remove your access credentials so that you are no longer able to access your data block.

Children’s Information

The Services are intended for a general audience and are not directed at children under an age determined by applicable law. We do not knowingly collect or store personal information about children without parental consent, unless permitted by law. Children are not permitted to create their own BanQu account. Parents of children or other adults can create an account on the child’s behalf.

All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. If you access the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be processed and transferred to the United States and be subject to U.S. law. The privacy and data protection laws in the United States may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. You understand and acknowledge that by using our website, accessed by any device, or by providing us with your information, we collect, transfer, store, and process your information to and in the United States.

Do Not Track Signal

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. We do not currently take action in response to those signals. If an industry standard on responding to such signals is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to those signals.

Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies

Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies

BanQu—as well as certain third parties that provide functionality on the Services—uses a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Services and the Internet. This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.

* Cookies. Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. For example, cookies can be used to store your login credentials so that you do not have to enter them each time you return to a website. Cookies also may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer so that a website can recognize you as the same user across different visits to the website. You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.

BanQu and the third parties that provide functionality on the Services may use cookies to relate the information automatically collected when you use the Services to information we obtain from you directly or from commercially available sources.

* Other local storage. We, along with third-party partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. These objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies, however. Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.
* Web beacons. We, along with our third-party partners, may also use technologies called Web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed. We and our partners use Web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the scope of the Services or for other reasons. Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted here each time you use the Services. If we make any material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we email you at the email address you have provided or will place a notice on our website. By continuing to use the Services after we make changes, you indicate your consent to those changes, except as limited by applicable law.

Questions and Contact Information

We want to assure you that we are dedicated to protecting your privacy. If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact [info@banqu.co](mailto:info@banqu.co).

If you and BanQu do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration.

While we may periodically update or correct information on the Services, we make no representation or warranty as to its accuracy, and we do not intend to update such information.

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that BanQu is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any transactions.

Links to Other Websites

The Services contain links to other websites maintained by other companies. We provide these links to you only as a convenience. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by us of any third-party site. We do not have any control over the content of such third-party sites and assume no responsibility whatsoever for the accuracy of any information contained on such third-party sites.

No Waiver

The failure of BanQu to enforce any provisions of the Terms or respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive its right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms or to act with respect to similar breaches.

Relationship

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and BanQu as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Service.

Third Parties and Assignments

These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.

Entire Agreement

Unless otherwise specified herein, the Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and BanQu and govern your use of the Service. If any portion of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.

Severability

If any provision or any part of a provision of these Terms is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable as a matter of law, that portion, provision, or part of the provision, as applicable, shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions, provisions, or part of provisions, as applicable, shall remain in full force and effect. If any invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable, or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the provision. To the extent that modification in accordance with the preceding two sentences is impossible, any invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision shall be deemed not to form part of these Terms and all other provisions of these Terms shall remain in force.
