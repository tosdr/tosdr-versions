About Your Personal Information and Uses
========================================

What Personal Information Does TrainPal Hold on Me and Others?
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Information You Provide Us Directly

TrainPal collects and uses the information you provide to us directly in order to provide you with the services you request. For example, you may provide us your name, email, passcode, fingerprint as passcode, and other information when you register a TrainPal account. When booking train tickets you may provide passenger names, email and delivery address, as well as other information such as age and gender. When paying for train tickets, you may provide your bank card number, CVV on back cardholder name, expiry date, etc.

In order for us to customize the services we provide you, we may also collect information about your travel plans and preferences which includes your departure date, departure city and arriving city, seat choice, ticket choice, provided by TrainPal.

If you need to get in touch with our customer service team, or reach out to us through other means (such as through social media) we will collect information from you there too, such as your name and contact information.

You may be travelling with other guests or make a booking on someone else’s behalf, in which case you will provide similar details to TrainPal. However, we would like to remind you that it is your responsibility to ensure that the person or people whose personal information you have provided are aware that you’ve done so, and have agreed to your sharing of their personal information with TrainPal for these purposes.

Duration of Processing of Personal Data.
----------------------------------------

TrainPal will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. TrainPal may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if TrainPal reasonably believes there is a prospect of litigation in respect to TrainPal’s relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, TrainPal will consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which TrainPal processes your personal data and whether TrainPal can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

Where will My Personal Data be Processed?
-----------------------------------------

TrainPal operates both inside and outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). It also cooperates with third-party vendors located both inside and outside of the EEA. Therefore, TrainPal may transfer your personal information to countries outside of the EEA, including to countries which may not have in place laws that apply the same level of data protection as within the EEA. Whenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement) in order to provide your personal information a level of data protection that applies within the EEA.
