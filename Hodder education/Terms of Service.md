b. You.

2. By registering for the Event you are agreeing to the below terms and conditions (your

“Booking”).

3. You agree that you are 18 years or older.

5. Spaces at an Event are restricted and are allocated on a first come first serve basis.

6. If you are booking on behalf of your education establishment, at the time of booking we will

request a provisional number of expected Participants in the Event (“Provisional Booking”).

This number must be confirmed 28 days prior to the Event and if you are making a booking

within 28 days of the Event you must confirm the total number of Participants at the time of

booking (“Confirmed Booking”). If you are booking for yourself, you will have a Confirmed

Booking at the time of making the Booking.

7. In the event you fail to confirm the total number of Participants in accordance with clause 6,

we reserve the right to release your booking and resell your provisional booking in the Event

your Booking;
