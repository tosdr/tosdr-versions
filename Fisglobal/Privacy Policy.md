-------------------------------------------

This Privacy Center will help you understand how FIS uses your personal data and how you can exercise your privacy rights.

Who we are
----------

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (“FIS”) is a leading provider of technology solutions for Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (“FIS”) is a leading provider of technology solutions for clients such as banks and capital markets firms globally. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, United States, FIS is a Fortune 500® company and a member of Standard & Poor’s 500® Index. FIS and its subsidiaries operate in multiple jurisdictions located around the globe. 

As a fintech group with a broad portfolio of solutions, FIS and its subsidiaries fulfill many roles including when processing personal data. For example, when we act as a service provider to banks and capital markets firms, we usually act as a “processor”, processing personal data based on our clients’ instructions. However, for the processing of personal data of our own staff, we act as an independent controller.

Sharing your personal data
--------------------------

We take care to allow your personal data to be accessed only by those who really need to in order to perform their tasks and duties, and to third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it. We disclose your personal data to the following categories of recipients.

Exercising your rights
----------------------

Depending on your location, you have certain rights under privacy and data protection laws related to the data we process about you. You may exercise those rights through the form accessible [here](https://dsar.oncentrl.com/fis.html?uuid=4503) or by sending us an email at DataRights@fisglobal.com.

We aim to respond to your request within 1 month or the specific timeframe required by the applicable laws, upon verification of your identity. We will honor the requests you make related to your rights as the law allows, which means, in some cases, there may be legal or other reasons we may not be able to address the specific request you make related to your rights.

Details of your rights are set out here.

Where we process your data and international data transfers
-----------------------------------------------------------

FIS is headquartered in the United States of America, and almost all data we process will be transferred to or accessed from the United States. Our subsidiaries and third-party service providers operate in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), and multiple other countries around the world.

We may transfer, access, or store personal data about you outside of the EEA, Switzerland, the UK, China, Japan, or another country that requires legal protections for international data transfer. When we do, we will make sure an adequate level of protection is provided for the personal data by using one or more of the following approaches:  

* We may transfer personal data to countries that have privacy laws that have been recognized by the country from which the data is transferred as providing similar protections for the data (“adequacy”).
* We may enter into written agreements, such as standard contractual clauses and other data transfer agreements, with recipients that require them, in substance, to provide the same level of protection for the data.
* We may seek your consent for transfers of your personal data for specific purposes.
* We may rely on other transfer mechanisms approved by authorities in the country from which the data is transferred.

When we share personal data within and among FIS affiliates, we make use of the Standard Contractual Clauses (as approved by the European Commission), the UK International Transfer Addendum, as well as model clauses issued in other countries to legitimize data transfers.

For Japanese individuals, information about the personal information protection system of various foreign countries where your data may be processed is available [here](https://www.ppc.go.jp/personalinfo/legal/kaiseihogohou/#gaikoku). An overview of data protection and privacy legislation worldwide is available [here](https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide).

Retention
---------

We will retain personal data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible, for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives, we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Methods of destruction: FIS’ workforce and vendors with access to personal data are required to comply with secure deletion standards in alignment with the latest NIST Guidelines for media sanitization.

Security
--------

We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data.

Please read our [Security Statement](https://www.fisglobal.com/en/solutions-legal/fis-information-security) that summarizes FIS’ information security policies, procedures, and standards including its technical and organizational measures for the security of data.

While we do our best to protect your personal data, privacy incidents are unfortunately becoming more common. In addition to the steps we take to protect your personal data, we believe there are measures you should take to protect yourself as well. We advise you to not share any personal data with others unless you clearly understand the purpose of the individual requesting the information, and you have confirmed you are dealing with a legitimate contact. We also recommend you not share any significant personal data via email or voicemail.

While we take precautions to protect your personal data from loss, theft, alteration, or misuse, no system or security measure is completely secure. Any transmission of your personal data is at your own risk, and we expect you will use appropriate measures to protect your personal data as well.

Data Processing Agreement
-------------------------

FIS’ Personal Data Processing Annex, which supplements our client contracts, is available [here](https://www.fisglobal.com/en/solutions-legal/fis-information-security).

You can request a DPA for completion and electronic signature by sending an email to [gdpr@fisglobal.com](mailto:gdpr@fisglobal.com).

Sale of Information
-------------------

Please read our CCPA / CPRA Sale of Information statement here.

Law enforcement
---------------

FIS may be required by law to provide information to government, law enforcement, and parties in civil lawsuits. This means we comply with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests, and other legal requirements. To protect clients and their customers’ rights, we only provide client information when we reasonably believe there is a legal requirement to do so and after comprehensive legal review.

When processing personal data, we apply the following principles:

* **Transparency**: we communicate openly and transparently about our personal data processing operations.

* **Responsible data management**: we apply appropriate data management practices to govern the processing of personal data. We carefully select external vendors and partners, and we limit disclosure of personal data to what is described in our privacy notices or to what has been authorized by our clients. We also store personal data for no longer than what is necessary or as is required by applicable laws and to maintain accuracy of data.
* **Security**: we implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, use, modification, or loss.
* **Accountability**: we are accountable for living up to our commitments throughout the FIS organization.

Workforce
---------

We process personal data for our workforce (temporary and permanent employees, contingent workers, independent contractors, students, retirees, and persons formerly in such roles with FIS) as well as personal data of other persons in relationships with members of our workforce.

The primary **controller** of FIS’ workforce personal data is the FIS company which employs, contracts, or engages the member of our workforce. If you have any questions about who this company is, please raise a ticket via the People Office Support Center.

Workforce personal data includes all personal data collected and processed in the context of an individual’s working relationship with FIS. FIS also processes workforce personal data regarding relatives, dependents, or other persons in relation to employees, contingent workers, independent contractors, students, retirees, and persons formerly in such roles with FIS when their personal data has been given to FIS by such persons with a working relationship with FIS.

In some jurisdictions, workforce personal data that is considered “sensitive personal data” under applicable laws may need to be collected as required or permitted by local law, for example, for the purposes of complying with equal opportunity measures or local tax requirements. What is considered sensitive personal data varies from country to country. An overview of the different types of sensitive personal data is available here. Please note, this does not mean that all the listed examples of potentially sensitive personal data will be processed for every member of our workforce; sensitive personal data will only be processed insofar as required or permitted under applicable law or as deemed necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by FIS from time to time and always in compliance with applicable laws. Applicable local law may in some circumstances require the data subject’s consent to process sensitive personal data.

Job Applicants
--------------

We process information from and about candidates in connection with employment or engagement opportunities at FIS. Information will be collected and used for the following purposes:

* Assess a candidate’s skills, qualifications, and suitability for the role.
* Carry out background and reference checks, where applicable.
* Communicate with candidates about the recruitment process.
* Keep records related to our hiring processes.
* Comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
* Stay connected with candidates who join the FIS Talent Network.

### **The information that is processed and how it is used**

The information we collect, the manner in which it is used, and the timing in which it is gathered varies depending on the country in which the FIS entity to which the candidate applies is located.

As general matter, the data we collect regarding all job applicants includes the information provided on resumes, CVs and/or application forms, including name, contact details, employment history and qualifications.

We use a candidate’s personal data to assess their skills, experience and suitability for roles offered by FIS. This information is passed to the relevant hiring managers and persons involved in the recruitment process to decide whether to invite the candidate for an interview.

FIS will process further information if the candidate is invited to the interview (or equivalent) stage and onward. Such information may include interview notes, assessment results, feedback and offer details. This information will be used to decide whether to offer a role and, depending on the country, may also be used for the purpose of drawing up and concluding a contract.

If FIS decides to make an offer, further information will be processed as part of the pre-employment background screening before the appointment is confirmed to confirm that a candidate meets internal and legal requirements relevant to the position and to confirm the information provided by the candidate. Such information may include education history, work history and references.  We will also need to confirm and/or establish a candidate’s right to work in the country in question. 

For successful candidates, we process personal data necessary for onboarding the candidate which may include processing information required to enroll the successful candidate in company benefits and to provide access to FIS systems. Such information may include applicable personal identity number (tax, citizenship, social security or possibly other types of individual numbers applicable due to that candidate’s country and role); data of any relevant related persons (name of spouse/partner, children, etc.); signature; bank account details; emergency contacts; insurance data; driving license number and training records.

Further information on the information processed on members of our workforce can be found here. 

If a candidate fails to provide information when requested, which is necessary for FIS to consider their application (such as evidence of qualifications or work history), we may not be able to take the application any further. 

In connection with our recruitment activities including applications and onboarding, we may also process special category data or sensitive personal data from candidates where we have a legal obligation to do so, or with the individual's explicit consent, where collecting such information is permitted by law. For example;

* Where allowed under applicable law, we may collect information about an individual’s disabilities to determine if requested or required adjustments during the recruitment process can reasonably be accommodated.
* Once onboarded, an individual’s provision of information regarding disabilities will also be used to provide a suitable working environment.
* We may also conduct criminal background checks for certain candidates to assess their eligibility or suitability to work at FIS or for FIS clients.
* In certain countries, we will also ask candidates to provide diversity information (for example about their race and/or ethnicity) for diversity monitoring and reporting purposes, although the provision of this information will in most countries be entirely voluntary. However, where a candidate does not voluntarily provide such information, we could be required by law in some countries to make our own assessment of such criteria.

### **FIS Talent Network**

Candidates have the opportunity to join the FIS Talent Network. Joining the Talent Network enhances a candidate’s job search and application process. By joining the Talent Network, candidates will receive job alerts with new job opportunities that match their interest, relevant recruitment marketing communications and have the possibility to share opportunities with family and friends. The data required to join the Talent Network are first name, last name, email address, phone number and areas of interest. Candidates can chose to also provide their current employer and current title.

### **How personal information is collected**

Depending on the country in which the FIS entity to which the candidate applies is located, FIS collects personal data about candidates from the following **sources**:

* Directly from the candidate – for example, information that provided by the candidate when applying for a position directly through the FIS careers website(s) or when joining the FIS Talent Network;
* From recruitment agencies – for example, when a recruitment agency contacts us to suggest an individual as a potential candidate;
* Through publicly available sources online – for example, where a candidate has a professional profile posted online (e.g., on their current employer's website or on a professional networking site, such as LinkedIn);
* By reference – for example, through a reference from a former employee or employer, or from a referee identified by the candidate;
* Results of assessments or background screening checks, either conducted directly or via a reputable background check provider.  Depending on the relevant country, such checks may include criminal record check, drug tests, credit check, employment history, education and/or qualification checks, identity and right to work checks and checks against international sanctions registers.

### **Recipients**

Candidate personal data may be disclosed to the following recipients or categories of recipients for a legitimate business need and/or process: FIS People Office, Legal, Corporate Compliance, Risk, M&A Team, Security, Supply Chain Management and Real Estate, Internal Audit, Finance and Accounting, Information Systems, members of the Board of Directors, management personnel, FIS Clients, and FIS-selected service providers.  FIS may also make candidate personal data available to other third parties as authorized, such as law enforcement, tax authorities, other public bodies, potential and actual acquirers of FIS companies or businesses if a change of ownership or business transfer is anticipated or occurs. For more information about the categories of entities to which we have disclosed this information, and the purposes for which we have disclosed the information, please see “With whom we share your personal data”.

### **Automated processing**

FIS recruitment processes do not result in decisions based solely on automated processing, although part of the application processes are automated. For example, FIS will ask questions about work authorization, compensation or travel requirements so that our recruiters can easily filter applicants for review (or not) based on their responses. In some countries, where this is legally allowed, FIS may decline applicants based on work authorization requirements. Candidates that apply for a role in one of FIS’ call centers may be subject to an additional text screening capability that may automatically invite candidates to the interview process based on satisfactory responses to the text questionnaire. Candidates not meeting the requirements will be manually declined by an FIS recruiter.

If you apply for a role at FIS, we will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary after we have communicated to you our decision about whether to appoint you to. We retain your personal data for that period so that we can show, in the event of a legal claim, that we have not discriminated against candidates on prohibited grounds and that we have conducted the recruitment exercise in a fair and transparent way.

We have an obligation to act in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to prevent fraud, money laundering and financing terrorism. As we are active in the financial sector, we are not allowed to accept just any client without checking them and we have to determine and report when suspicious transactions take place.

* Verify your identity;

To carry out the above checks, we process the information (including personal data) that you have provided to us and other information created by your use of the FIS services. Which may include your name, your contact information, a copy of your identification document, your tax identification number (if legally required), the address of your legal representative and shareholders, your bank account number, information contained in correspondence between us, bank statements, your signature and an extract of your company registration document.

Consumers ("buyers")
--------------------

FIS is a payment service provider and as such Worldpay from FIS (“Worldpay”) provides **payment processing, acquiring and gateway services** to its clients which operate as merchants. Being an acquirer means that Worldpay accepts payment on behalf of the relevant merchant and then transfers the funds paid by the buyer (“you”) to the merchant. Worldpay’s role is to request the relevant payment scheme, such as Mastercard, Visa or Maestro or an alternative payment method provider, to authorize the transaction and (if necessary) send this to the buyer’s bank for approval. If the necessary authorizations and approvals are given, Worldpay is notified of this by the relevant payment scheme or alternative payment method provider and makes the payment to the merchant’s bank. Worldpay may also enable merchants to pay others, like you, by sending payments to your bank account or payment card (for example, payouts of insurance claims or gambling winnings). We rely on card networks and banking partners to complete the payment to your bank account or payment card.

When we provide merchant acquiring services and other payment services to our client, Worldpay processes your personal data as an independent data controller.

Worldpay also offers its clients **fraud detection services**. For some of these fraud services we act as a processor on behalf of, and under the instructions of, our merchants. We recommend you read the merchant’s privacy notices for more information regarding the processing of your personal data. This notice applies to the processing of your personal data for fraud detection, prevention and monitoring where Worldpay acts as an independent controller.

### **Purposes for which we process buyer’s personal data and types of personal data**

* We process the data we need for our legitimate interest of providing so-called gateway, payment processing and/or acquiring services to our merchants which receive payments from you for any reason (including, without limitation, for the sale of their goods and services). This means that we receive your payment transaction data on behalf of the merchant and handle related matters around these financial transactions. In addition, when a merchant wishes to charge your card for a recurring payment and your card has expired, Worldpay may request the relevant payment scheme or lookup up your up-to-date card information on the Worldpay platform, to facilitate your payment.
* We process the data to pay others, like you, on behalf of our merchant clients and handle related matters around these financial transactions.
* We may process your personal data when necessary to initiate (or arrange the initiation of) payments from your bank account, if you and your bank authorize us (and/or our partners) to do so.
* In addition, we process your data to comply with our legal obligations, such as to monitor financial transactions for the purpose of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. For these purposes we may collect your card number (which we encrypt in accordance with PCI DSS standards), the expiry date (month and year) of your credit card, your bank account details (typically excluding your name), including IBAN and SWIFT/BIC, the amount of the transaction and the currency in which the transaction is done, the date, time and location of the transaction and the category and ID of the merchant with whom you are shopping. 
* If necessary, we can also process any of your information above for our legitimate interest of protecting our legal rights, for example in connection with legal claims, and when we have a legal obligation to process your information. 
* In addition, Worldpay processes your personal data for the following purposes:
    * To provide the service pursuant to the agreements with our clients and the specific payment schemes;
    * To comply with applicable laws and regulations;
    * To conduct analysis for statistical, strategic and scientific purposes; and
    * To protect our platform, systems and services from misuse, fraud, financial crimes or other unauthorized or illegal activity.
* We process personal data for purposes of protecting you and our clients against fraud or unauthorized transactions and preventing and monitoring fraud across Worldpay’s payment solutions. This includes the identification of fraud with the payment details provided by our merchants or information about fraud from other third parties such as issuing banks, acquirers or scheme owners. Additionally, Worldpay may use and aggregate your personal data to create and run models or other methods to accurately identify, predict, prevent and mitigate fraud across Worldpay’s payment solutions. These models or other methods may be leveraged to offer fraud-related products and services to our merchants. For fraud detection, prevention and monitoring, Worldpay may process transaction data (such as card number and cardholder name, email address, location data, IP address, information about disputed transactions, information on confirmed fraud, merchant details, mobile devises and unique identifiers).The use of these fraud models and/or other methods may result in merchants making decisions as to whether or not to grant you access to a product or service and/or whether or not to authorize a transaction.

### **Recipients**

In some jurisdictions, we may need the help of third parties to be able to offer you our acquiring or issuing services, for example payment schemes such as Mastercard and VISA. It will depend on your location, payment method and issuing bank which of these payment schemes is used. Additionally, we share your information with the merchant with whom you are shopping. We may also share some of your information with competent authorities and/or regulators in case this is required to comply with legal obligations to which Worldpay is subject, for example for the purpose of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.

We use third-party service providers to support us in providing acquiring and fraud detecting services. These include risk, fraud, and compliance service providers (e.g. for transaction risk monitoring); debt service providers (e.g. for debt collection analysis or management); and for business analytics (e.g. for data aggregation, visualization and reporting).

Otherwise, we will not share your identifiable information with any third party, unless we have your permission, where this is necessary in connection with the purposes above or with legal claims or when we have a legal obligation to do so.

Visitors to our buildings are provided with a temporary access badge to access our building. Our visitor records will be used to verify that access badges are returned, to look into a security incident, and for emergency purposes (for example, if an office needs to be evacuated).

### **Wi-Fi**

We monitor and log traffic on our Wi-Fi networks. This allows us to see limited information about a user’s network behavior but will also include being able to see at least the source and destination addresses the user is connecting from and to.

FIS uses CCTV monitoring where permitted by law. CCTV images are securely stored and only accessible on a need-to-know basis (for example, to investigate a potential incident). We are allowed to disclose CCTV images to law enforcement bodies. We will also share CCTV images with our insurers for purposes of processing an insurance claim as a result of an incident. CCTV recordings are typically deleted or automatically overwritten after a short period of time unless an issue is identified that requires further investigation.

This will pinpoint unique characteristics in the way you speak, such as pitch, language, and speech patterns, to create a mathematical formula to produce a unique identifier for your voice. This identifier is a unique code made up of a series of numbers and letters which can be used only to identify your voice.

Once you've enrolled in the voiceprint  program, whenever you call us, our phone system will confirm who you are by comparing your voice to your unique voiceprint and check details about the device and phone number that you're contacting us from. This confirms it's really you calling and you’ll then be able to speak to one of our representatives or use our self-serve features.

Our goal is to make it simpler for you to do business with us, and by using voiceprints, it protects both you and FIS against fraud, misrepresentations and other errors. Your voiceprint will only be used to confirm your identity and replaces other methods of verification such as questions asked by one of our representatives to validate your identity.

Your unique voiceprint cannot be used to reverse engineer, reuse or recreate your voice.  Your voiceprint is encrypted and kept in a secured database.

### **Exercising your rights**

If you no longer want to use our voice authentication services, just let us know and we will  deregister you from the service and remove your voiceprint data from our systems.

CCPA / CPRA Sale of Information
-------------------------------

FIS only uses personal information in accordance with applicable law, including the CCPA and the CPRA, and in accordance with contractual obligations owing to clients and other third parties. FIS only uses personal information provided by clients to FIS to provide its services and does not sell personal information to third parties if prohibited by law or contractual limitations.

FIS have not sold or shared personal information of any employee over the past 12 months for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising. 

We have disclosed personal information to our support providers for business purposes in the prior twelve months. The information we have disclosed for business purposes may include some or all of the categories listed in our Preference Center. For more information about the categories of entities to which we have disclosed this information and the purposes for which we have disclosed the information, please see “With whom we share your personal data”.

While FIS does not sell personal information in exchange for any monetary consideration (except where allowed under client contracts), we do share personal information for other benefits that could be deemed a “sale,” as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(t)(1)). We support the CCPA and wish to provide you with control over how your personal information is collected and shared.

Law Enforcement
---------------

FIS respects the rules and laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates, as well as the privacy and rights of its clients. Accordingly, FIS provides client information in response to law enforcement or other public authority requests only when we reasonably believe we are legally required to do so. To protect our clients’ rights, we carefully review requests to confirm they comply with the law and are within the powers of the requesting authority or law enforcement official.

To obtain client information from FIS, public authority and law enforcement officials must provide legal process appropriate for the type of information sought, such as a subpoena, court order, or a warrant. For example, FIS will not provide non-public client data unless served with a valid search warrant, issued on a showing of probable cause by a federal or state court authorized to issue search warrants, which requires FIS to disclose the content.

FIS reviews all governmental requests for data.  FIS strictly construes requests for data, and seeks to limit or object to requests that are overbroad or seek a large amount of information or affect a large number of users.  FIS also objects where production is prohibited or where the process served is insufficient to compel production of the requested data under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701, et seq. or other applicable law. FIS reserves the right to appeal any request for information, where available, and shall not disclose the requested information until required to do so under applicable procedural rules.

FIS occasionally does receive  requests  from  law  enforcement  agencies  in  the  United  States  and elsewhere, seeking data processed by FIS. More information about the requests that FIS has received can be found in our Transparency Reports that are available for our clients on the FIS Client Portal. Access to the FIS Client Portal can be arranged for clients via their FIS account manager.
