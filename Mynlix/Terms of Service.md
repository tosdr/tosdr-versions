5.1 Contracting Party has the obligation to pay NL-ix the costs for the Service as specified on the Order Form. All costs of payment such as, but not limited to,

commission, exchange rates or wire transfer fees shall be borne by Contracting Party. NL-ix provides invoices in electronic form by e-mail standard. If

customer requires additional invoicing procedures such as, but not limited to, a paper invoice, additional documentation or tax declarations to accompany

the invoice, NL-ix reserves the right to charge an additional processing fee of € 50 per invoice.

5.2 Fixed recurring costs shall be invoiced per calendar-quarter 14 days before the start of each calendar-quarter. Initial one-time costs, and fixed recurring

cost for the remainder of the 1st operational calendar quarter, shall be invoiced at date of Service delivery.

5.3 Usage costs, if applicable, shall be invoiced monthly in arrears conform the 95-percentile model: The 95% model is a method to determine the traffic

volume on a Service over a calendar month and is used for billing purposes:

1\. Every 5 minutes two measurements (transmit and receive) are made of the total traffic that has passed over the port since last measurement.

2\. At the end of the calendar month all measurements (the highest of transmit and receive) of that month (generally 12\*24\*30=8,640) are lined up and

sorted from high to low.

3\. The highest 5% of the measurements (so generally 5% \* 8,640 = 432) is dropped, and the next highest measurement defines the 95% traffic level on

which the billing for that month is based.

Invoices for usage shall be sent one working day after the end of the monthly period.

5.4 Traffic commitment: Services with a certain traffic commitment, already include traffic up to this level in the fixed monthly price. The burst fee of the

Service is only applicable for traffic over the commitment level. A few examples:

If you have a 5 Mbit/s commitment and actually use 7 Mbit/s, in addition to the fixed monthly fee you pay for 7-5= 2 Mbit/s of burst traffic;

If you have a 15 Mbit/s commitment and use 12 Mbit/s, you only pay the fixed monthly fee and no burst traffic.

NL-ix will charge the committed traffic per calendar-quarter in advance as per the fixed recurring costs.

5.5 All prices and rates are stated in euro exclusive of value added tax (VAT) and other government levies.

5.6 Payment for all NL-ix invoices are due within 14 days of the date of the invoice.

1\. If NL-ix has not received payment before the date due Contracting Party will be in default without the need for further notice of default. From that

moment Contracting Party is liable for interest at 1% per month or part of a month from the day of the original due date.

2\. In the event that Contracting Party is overdue on its payment obligations for more than two consecutive months, NL-ix may, upon no less than fifteen (15)

days prior written notice to Contracting Party, suspend Services until Contracting Party’s account is current.

3\. The obligation to pay is not suspended if Contracting Party lodges a formal complaint about the invoice or if the debtor terminates the contract.

If Contracting Party fails to fulfil any payment obligations, Contracting Party is liable for all costs (in addition to the principal and interest) incurred in obtaining

payment out of court. The extrajudicial collection costs amount to at least 15% of the principal amount with a minimum of € 250.00, excluding VAT. All court

costs relating to the collection of the invoiced sums will be borne by the Contracting Party.

5.7 Contracting Party shall make all payments due under the Agreement in full. If Contracting Party is obliged by applicable law to make payments subject to

any deduction or withholding, Contracting Party will inform NL-ix of the extent of such deductions in which case the sum payable shall be increased to the

extent necessary to ensure that after the required deduction and withholding NL-ix receives a net sum equal to the sum which NL-ix would have received if

such deductions or withholding had not been required.

5.8 NL-ix may annually re-assess the costs of the NL-ix Service(s) and shall be entitled to change the price for any following year subject to giving at least 2

calendar months’ notice. In such cases, if the price increase is greater than an inflationary adjustment based on the consumer price index, Customer is

entitled to terminate the service without penalty at the end of this notice period before the changes go into effect.

5.9 Where NL-ix provides services where such services are partially or fully based on reselling services purchased from third parties (e.g. patches, waves,

fibers or remote access to other exchanges), NL-ix reserves the right to pass on any price increases levied by third parties to Contracting Party when the

increases become effective.

5.10Payments for all NL-ix invoices are made by the Contracting Party or an affiliated entity (associated third party). On request the Contracting Party will

provide NL-ix all requested information/evidence in case payments are made by an affiliated entity (associated third party). Payments made by a non-
