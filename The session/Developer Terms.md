[The Session](https://thesession.org/)

API
===

The Session has a read-only API. This is useful for one-off queries. If you need access to all of the data on the site, you can download CSV and JSON files of [data from The Session on Github](https://github.com/adactio/TheSession-data) ([.zip](https://github.com/adactio/TheSession-data/archive/master.zip)). These are updated about once a week.

Information that is available through the website as HTML is also available in other formats. To request a URL in another format, add `?format=` to the URL with one of the these formats specified:

Formats
-------

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| JSON | ?format=json |
| XML | ?format=xml |
| RSS | ?format=rss |

Endpoints
---------

The following lists are available in multiple formats e.g. [/tunes/new?format=json](https://thesession.org/tunes/new?format=json) or [/recordings/search?q=altan&format=rss](https://thesession.org/recordings/search?q=altan&format=rss)

By default, 10 items will be returned in a list. You can request up to 50 items by appending &perpage= e.g. [/tunes/new?format=json&perpage=35](https://thesession.org/tunes/new?format=json&perpage=35)

If you request an individual item, e.g. [/tunes/27?format=xml](https://thesession.org/tunes/27?format=xml), you will get back the details for that item and any comments that have been posted to it.
