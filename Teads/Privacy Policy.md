The collection of personal data based on your consent is done by using a consent form as for instance on our Contact Us page. Your consent is stored and documented in our systems. You may withdraw any consent to personal data processing at any time.

### Legitimate interest

We may use your personal data if it is considered to be of legitimate interest, and if your privacy interests do not override this interest. To establish the legal basis for data collection, an assessment has been made during which a mutual interest between you and Teads has been identified. This legal basis is primarily related to our sales and marketing purposes. We will always inform you about your privacy rights and the purpose for collecting your personal data. In such cases, you can always choose to object to the processing of your personal data.

We reserve the right to disclose or transfer your personally identifiable information as required by law, as part of a merger, acquisition, dissolution or sale of assets, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change of ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.

We may also disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request.

To do so, please email us at [dpo@teads.com](mailto:dpo@teads.com). US residents can as well call us at 1-866-467-8688 (1-866-I-OPT-OUT). When being prompted, please use the code 777#.

* **How to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information:** We offer an opt-out from the use of cookies and other tracking technologies in connection with our Services, which may in some cases constitute the sale of your personal information under the CCPA or other privacy laws.  To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, please click [**Do Not Sell My Personal Information**](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) or follow the browser setting instructions below. This will cause information to cease to be added to any cookies or other tracking technologies that have been set on our Services or block them entirely.  Please note that you will need to opt out again if you visit one of our Services from a different device or browser of if you clear your cookies.     

### Verification

Please note, we will take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling any consumer request. If you maintain an account with us, we will verify your identity through existing authentication practices for the account (e.g., login and password). If you are not a registered user, we will verify your identity by matching two or three data points that you provide with data points that we maintain and have determined to be reliable for the purposes of verification (e.g., browser and device ID). 

### Authorized Agents

You can use an authorized agent to make such requests on your behalf. But we may require the agent to provide a written permission and verify his/her identity or demonstrate that he or she has power of attorney. 

### Anti-Discrimination Right.

You have the right to be free from discrimination in product quality, goods or services if you choose to exercise your privacy rights under the CCPA. 

### Do Not Track Signals

Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we stop running targeted advertising in response to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms.
