This privacy policy addresses the collection, use, and disclosure of information we collect from you on our website or digital property that links to the policy. Other websites that may be accessible through this website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. If you link to any such website, we urge you review the website’s privacy policy.

**Ad Choices**

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to this website and elsewhere on the Internet over time, as well as from various mobile applications you use, and across different associated devices. This is called “interest-based advertising.” Interest-based advertising includes when Advertising Partners identify possible relationships among different browsers and devices.

Additionally, if you would like to opt-out of this type of advertising in mobile apps, you can visit https://youradchoices.com/appchoices and download the appropriate app for your device.

It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or devices, erase cookies, or reset a device identifier from your browser or mobile device, you may need to renew you opt-out choice.
