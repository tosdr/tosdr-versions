**H. Disputes**

Any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to these hear.com Mobile Communications Terms and Conditions, the breach thereof, or mobile communications sent by or on behalf of hear.com—including the suitability of your or hear.com’s claim for arbitration—shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. If an arbitrator’s award is granted, it is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither party may bring an action, in arbitration or otherwise, unless the action is started within two years of the occurrence allegedly causing the damage in question. No arbitration brought under, or with respect to, this Section is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Mobile Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless hear.com and you mutually agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general, or class proceeding.

The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Monetary relief shall be awarded only for direct damages; monetary relief shall not be granted for consequential damages, incidental damages, or lost profits.

Any arbitration award and any judgment confirming shall not have any precedential effect and may not be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.

For arbitration claims you assert against hear.com in accordance with this Section (but not for any arbitration claim against you), hear.com will pay your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator’s fees and costs for the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or witnesses) in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside. hear.com will pay its, and you will pay your, lawyers’, experts’, and witnesses’ fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims.

Before seeking arbitration, you must first send to hear.com a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must be sent by certified mail to hear.com LLC 396 Alhambra Circle, Suite 1200 Coral Gables, FL 33134. The Notice should describe the nature and basis of your claim or dispute and the specific relief you seek. If you and hear.com cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty days after the Notice is received, you or hear.com may commence arbitration.

**I. Disclaimer of warranties**

hear.com sends mobile communications on an “as-is” basis. Hear.com specifically disclaims all express or implied warranties related to its mobile communications.

**J. Disclaimer of insurances**

hear.com LLC is not responsible for any insurance claims filed by customers for services provided, and customers are solely liable for ensuring such claims are accurate and compliant with insurance regulations.

**K. Governing law**

These Mobile Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law provisions.

**L. Severability**

If, for any reason, a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, of these Mobile Terms unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remainder of these Mobile Terms shall remain in full force and effect.

**M. Survival**

Sections H through K shall survive any termination of these Mobile Terms by either hear.com or you.

[](#referral-terms-and-conditions)Referral Terms and Conditions
---------------------------------------------------------------

**hear.com Referral Program**

By participating in the hear.com referral program (the “Program”), you acknowledge and agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions (“Terms”) stated herein, which are in addition to and subject to hear.com’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.hear.com/privacy-policy/), and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not participate in the program. Hear.com reserves the right to modify or terminate the program at any time and in any matter in whole or in part, as outlined below.

**1\. ELIGIBILITY**

Anyone may be a referrer in the Program (“Referrer”) so long as you: (1) are a legal resident of the fifty (50) United States or the District of Columbia; (2) you are the age of majority in your state/jurisdiction of permanent resident; and (3) your account is in good standing. The Program is void elsewhere and where prohibited.

**2\. HOW TO PARTICIPATE AND REDEEM REWARD**

To participate in the Program as a Referrer, you must refer a friend or family member (the “Referred”).

In order to participate, a Referrer must provide hear.com with the Referred’s full name and valid email address on or before 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time on December 31, 2021 by doing the following:

**a.** Existing customers will receive an email requesting that they refer a friend or family member to hear.com. This email will contain a link to a web page where they can add the names and email addresses of people they would like to refer. Note: Existing customers will only be able to refer three (3) people.

**b.** Then, the Referred person will receive an email (the “Referral Email”) from hear.com stating that they have been referred and asking them to complete a questionnaire.

**c.** Once the Referred person makes a purchase on hear.com and starts their trial, the Referrer will receive their reward via email.

For every Referred person that makes a purchase on hear.com after receiving a Referral Email, the Referrer will receive a $300.00 Amazon Gift Card via email. The Referred person will receive a $300.00 discount on their purchase.

**3\. TERMS OF REDEEMING REWARDS**

The rewards cannot be sold, transferred, or redeemed for cash, and they may not be combined with other offers, promotions or discounts.

**Limit:** Three (3) Reward redemptions per Referrer, per year. Limited (1) Reward redemptions per Referred person, per year.

In the event that a Referred person receives multiple Referral Emails, hear.com will only provide Rewards for the first Referral Email through which the Referred person makes a purchase. This means that if multiple Referrers refer the same person, only one of those Referrers will be entitled to receive a reward (i.e., the Referrer whose Referral Link is used first by the Referred person to make an eligible purchase) and the Referred person will only receive one reward; all other referrals will automatically be invalidated.

Rewards are subject to verification. Hear.com reserves the right to delay or refuse to issue a reward for reasons that hear.com may deem relevant, such as noncompliance with the Terms or any deceptive behavior.

Referrals will not be accepted after 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time on December 31, 2021. Notwithstanding the foregoing, hear.com reserve the right to cancel or modify the Terms of the Program at any time, including (without limitation) by canceling the Program prior to that date.

**4\. RESTRICTIONS**

Exploiting the Program or assisting others to exploit the Program is strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification from the Program. Referrers cannot refer themselves or create multiple, fictitious or fake accounts with hear.com. In addition, Referrers and Referred persons may not (i) use the Program to violate any law, infringe or violate the rights of any third party, or otherwise act in a manner that is deemed unfair, disruptive, harassing, harmful, illegal, hateful, obscene or outside the spirit and intent of the Program; (ii) tamper with the Program; (iii) collect or harvest any personally identifiable information from the Program or associated website(s); or (iv) use any system, bot or other device or artifice to participate or receive any benefit in the Program.

SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, HEAR.COM RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SEEK REMEDIES AND DAMAGES (INCLUDING ATTORNEY FEES) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW, INCLUDING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

**5\. MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION OF THE PROGRAM**

The Program is offered at the discretion of hear.com, and hear.com reserves the right to terminate, suspend, or modify the Program, these Terms, the Rewards, conditions of participation, or any other aspect of the Program, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice, even though such changes may affect Rewards already earned. You understand that the most recent version of the Terms will be available at this page. Your continued participation in the Program following the posting on this page of any modification will indicate your acceptance of any modification to the Terms hereof. You may object to the modification to the Program and/or its Terms by no longer participating.
