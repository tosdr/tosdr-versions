All Users must abide by Eventbrite's [Community Guidelines](https://www.eventbrite.com/l/community-guidelines/) which are incorporated by reference into, and are part of, these Terms. Please read these carefully, as they affect what types of content and conduct are permitted when using the Services. 3. Users may be bound by the following additional terms, which are incorporated by reference into, and are part of, these Terms:

A. If you are an Organizer, Eventbrite's [Merchant Agreement](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/346993/eventbrite-merchant-agreement/) and [Organizer Refund Policy Requirements](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/827759/eventbrites-organizer-refund-policy-requirements/) apply to you.

D. If you are a third party interacting with our Services not as an Organizer or a Consumer, the [API Terms of Use](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/833731/eventbrite-api-terms-of-use/) and/or [Trademark and Copyright Policy](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/562130/eventbrite-trademark-copyright-policy/) might be applicable to you. Please be on the lookout for additional terms and conditions displayed with certain Services that you may use from time to time, as those will also be applicable to you.  4. We may sometimes provide you with services that are not described in these Terms and unless we have entered into a separate, signed agreement that expressly supersedes these Terms, these Terms will apply to those services as well.

**1.4** **Your Authority.**

**Using our Services on behalf of an entity will bind that entity to these Terms.**

If you will be using the Services on behalf of an entity (such as on behalf of your employer), you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and its Affiliates and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that entity as well as yourself.

### 2\. Eventbrite's Services and Role

**2.1** **What we do.** 

We offer an events management and growth platform that helps Organizers and Consumers thrive and connect through memorable live experiences. Through our Services, Organizers can create, post and manage online or in-person events, sell tickets, solicit donations and stay connected to Consumers through a suite of marketing tools.

**2.2** **How we fit in.**

We are not the creator, organizer, or owner of the events listed on the Services nor are we the seller of tickets, registrations or any merchandise on the Services. Instead, we provide our Services, which allow Organizers to manage ticketing and registrations and promote their events. 

When hosting an event, the Organizer is solely responsible for ensuring that their event and any page displaying an event complies with any applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and that the goods and services described on the event page are delivered as described and in an accurate, satisfactory manner. 

If the Organizer is hosting an event with paid tickets, the Organizer selects the payment processing method offered to Consumers for its event as more fully described in the [Merchant Agreement](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/346993/eventbrite-merchant-agreement/). Consumers must use the payment processing method the Organizer selects to collect payment. 

If the Organizer uses Eventbrite Payment Processing (defined in the [Merchant Agreement](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/346993/eventbrite-merchant-agreement/)), we act as the Organizer's limited agent to process payments from Consumers on the Organizer's behalf using our third-party payment service providers. If the Organizer selects Facilitated Payment Processing (defined in the [Merchant Agreement](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/346993/eventbrite-merchant-agreement/)), we transmit the Consumer’s payment details to the Organizer’s designated payment provider but do not process the transaction.

### 3\. Privacy and Consumer Information

**3.1 Privacy Policy.**

**We follow our Privacy Policy when handling and protecting your personal data.**

We are committed to protecting your personal data that you provide or that we collect through Eventbrite Properties as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/460838/eventbrite-privacy-policy/).

**3.2 Cookies.**

**We use cookies, pixels and similar technologies and provide you choices to manage your preferences.** 

We and our vendors use cookies, scripts, and other technologies to collect information on a real-time basis about how you use and navigate our Services. This may include your IP address, as well as information about your browsing behavior, page visits, clicks and cursor movements and searches on our sites. This information will be collected directly by, or disclosed to, our vendors and used to evaluate your use of the Services. 

Our [Cookie Statement](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/666792/eventbrite-cookie-policy/) further explains how we use cookies, pixels and other similar technologies when you visit Eventbrite Properties or use our Services. You may modify how Eventbrite uses your cookies at any time. To do so, please visit the "Cookie Preferences" link in the footer of our website.

**3.3 Consumer Information.**

**We expect you to follow the rules when dealing with information about Consumers.**

If you are an Organizer, you will at all times comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national, and other laws, rules, and regulations with respect to information you collect from (or receive about) Consumers or other individuals, and comply with any applicable policies posted by us on the Services with respect to information you collect from (or receive about) Consumers.

### 4\. Term; Termination

**4.1 Term.**

**These Terms apply when you access our Services.**

These Terms apply to you as soon as you access the Services by any means and will continue to apply until they are terminated. There may come a time when either you or Eventbrite decides it's best to part ways as described in Sections 4.2 or 4.3 below. When that happens, these Terms will generally no longer apply. However, as described in Section 4.4, certain provisions will always remain applicable to both you and us.

**4.2 Termination.**

**We can revoke your access to our Services.**

1\. We may suspend or terminate your right to use the Services at any time, including if:

A. you violate or breach these Terms or any other agreement between you and us, or if you fail to pay any amounts when due;

B. you misuse or abuse the Services, or use the Services in a way not intended or permitted by us;

C. you engage in any conduct on or off the Eventbrite Properties that jeopardizes the safety of our community or integrity of the Eventbrite Properties or interferes with the experience of our community or the Eventbrite Properties; or

D. allowing you to access and use the Services would violate any applicable local, state, provincial, national, or other laws, rules and regulations or court order or would expose us to legal liability.

2\. We may choose to stop offering the Services, or any particular portion of the Services, or modify or replace any aspect of the Services, at any time. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our termination of your access to the Services, if we believe that failure to do so would materially prejudice you. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party as a result of our termination of your right to use or otherwise access the Services.

**4.3 Deleting Your Account.**

**We hope you want to continue using our Services, but please refer to this paragraph if you don’t.**

Except as agreed otherwise in a separate written agreement between you and us or other Affiliated Agreement (defined in the [Merchant Agreement](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/346993/eventbrite-merchant-agreement/)), you may terminate your access to the Services and the general applicability of Terms by [deleting your account](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/408017/how-to-close-your-eventbrite-account/). If you are a Consumer using the Services without a registered Eventbrite account, your only option for these Terms to no longer apply is to stop accessing the Services indefinitely. So long as you continue to access the Services, even without an account, these Terms remain in effect. If there is a separate agreement between you and us governing your use of the Services and that agreement terminates or expires, these Terms (as unmodified by such agreement) will govern your use of the Services after such termination or expiration.

**4.4 Survival of Terms.**

**Certain provisions will always remain applicable to both you and us.**

All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination of these Terms will survive (i.e., they will continue to apply to you) including all limitations on liability, releases, indemnification obligations, disclaimers of warranties, agreements to arbitrate, choices of law and judicial forum, and intellectual property protections and licenses.

3\. you will not use the Services in connection with any direct or indirect activities or dealings with or involving any Restricted Area or Restricted Party, and will not otherwise use the Services in any manner that would cause Eventbrite to be in violation of applicable Trade Controls. 

### 6\. Release and Indemnification

**6.1 Release.**

**You won’t bring us into any disputes between you and a third party.**

1\. You hereby agree to release us (collectively with our Affiliates and subsidiaries, and each of our and their respective officers, directors, agents, co-branders, licensors, payment processing partners, vendors, other partners, independent contractors and employees, the “Eventbrite Released Parties”) from all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise), losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of a dispute between you and a third party (including other Users) in connection with any of the following:

**6.2 Indemnification.**

**You agree to have our back if a third party comes after us because of something you did or failed to do.**

1\. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Eventbrite Released Parties from any and all damage (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), loss, liability, cost and expense (including reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees) resulting from any claim, demand, suit, proceeding (whether before an arbitrator, court, mediator or otherwise) or investigation made by any third party (each a "Claim") relating to or arising out of:

2\. We will provide notice to you of any such Claim, but our failure or delay in providing such notice will not limit your indemnification obligations except to the extent you are materially prejudiced by such failure. Also, in certain circumstances, we may choose to handle the Claim ourselves, in which case you agree to cooperate with us in any way we request.

### 7\. Disclaimer of Warranties and Assumption of Risks by You 

**7.1 Disclaimers.**

**We strive to provide Services in the way you need them, but there are some things we can’t promise.**

1\. To the extent allowed under applicable laws, the Services (including the Beta Services, defined below) are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Eventbrite expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose.

3\. We are not liable for the acts or omissions of any third parties, including third parties that help us provide the Services, that an Organizer chooses to assist with an event, or that you choose to use or contract with when using the Services.

**7.2 Assumption of Risks.**

**You must assume risks that are inherent in attending live events.**

Some events may carry inherent risk and by participating in those events, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily. For example, some events may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those events.

**7.3 Eventbrite-Hosted Events.**

**Most events on our platform are not hosted by Eventbrite, but if and when you participate in one that is, you assume all risks.**

When you attend an event hosted by us, you waive any and all claims and causes of action against the Eventbrite Released Parties, the event producers and presenters, and their insurers, for liability, including for personal injury, property damage or wrongful death in connection with your attendance of the event.

**7.4 Beta Services.**

**You may have an opportunity to try out certain beta services from time to time.**

We may make available certain beta and other pre-release software, services, equipment, and related documentation, materials, and information to you from time to time, for your use on a voluntary basis, as part of an early-release, early-access program (collectively, the “Beta Services”) for the purposes of us gathering information and Users providing us with Feedback on the quality and usability of the Beta Services. The Beta Services may not meet the same level of performance as that of a commercially available product offering, and the Beta Services may not operate correctly and may be subject to substantial modification, including deprecation, during and after the period in which you may use them. We are not liable to you in connection with your use of our Beta Services, and we may revoke your access to the Beta Services at any time with or without reason or notice. 

**7.5 Application of Disclaimers.**

**The disclaimers will apply so long as they are allowed under law.**

The disclaimers in these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any warranties are required by applicable law, they will be limited to the shortest duration allowed. 

### 8\. Limitation of Liability

**8.1 Eventbrite Liability.**

**In order to provide our Services on a large scale, we have to limit our liability to you.**

1\. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Eventbrite Released Parties, will not be liable to you or any third party, for:

B. any Feedback that you give or receive; or

C. Your Content or Your Trademarks.

2\. In addition, other than our obligation to pay out Event Proceeds in certain circumstances to certain Organizers under the [Merchant Agreement](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/346993/eventbrite-merchant-agreement/), and only in accordance with those terms, the Eventbrite Released Parties’ maximum aggregate liability is limited to the following:

**All of our Terms are meant to comply with the law.**

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or conditions on, or the limitation of, liability for loss or damage caused by willful acts, negligence, breach of contract or breach of implied terms, or incidental or consequential damages. Only those liability and other limitations which are lawful in your jurisdiction (if any) will apply to you, and our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 9\. IMPORTANT: BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS.

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (TO THE EXTENT THE CLAIM QUALIFIES) AND WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY; YOU AGREE THAT CLASS, CONSOLIDATED (EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED BELOW), OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS AND CIVIL ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND ANY RIGHTS TO BRING SUCH ACTIONS ARE WAIVED BY EACH PARTY.**

The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

**9.1 Customer Support.**

**Contact us first if you have an issue with our Services.**

You agree that if you have a question or concern about the Services, you will [contact us](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/contact-us/) first, prior to initiating any legal proceeding. Our customer support team will try to answer your question or resolve your concern.

**9.2 Arbitration Process.**

**If a dispute can’t be resolved between us, it must be resolved through arbitration.**

In the unlikely event that our customer support team is unable to resolve your concerns, you and we each agree to resolve all disputes and claims between you and us, including any arising under or relating to these Terms, your use of the Services, or your and our relationship, through binding arbitration or (to the extent the claim qualifies) in small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. As explained below, the appointed arbitrator will have authority to enter all relief that would be available in court, to the extent warranted by the claims. All arbitrations and small claims proceedings will proceed only on an individual basis. In no event may either we or you seek to resolve a dispute with the other as part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding, except as provided for in Section 9.9 below. Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review. Only the appointed arbitrator – and not any court – will have the authority to resolve any dispute relating to this Section, including any dispute regarding the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of these Terms. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms and any other agreement between you and us. These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 9 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section 9.8 below.

**9.3 Applicability.**

**Our agreement to arbitrate applies to almost all claims.**

1\. This agreement to arbitrate applies to all legal disputes between you and us. It includes, but is not limited to: (i) all claims relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; (ii) all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including claims relating to advertising); and (iii) all claims that may arise after termination of these Terms and/or your use of the Services.

2\. Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you or we may choose to bring: 

A. an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the extent the applicable claim qualifies); or 

B. enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court in the U.S. Patent or Trademark Office to protect your or our Intellectual Property Rights. "Intellectual Property Rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights.

3\. In addition, the portion of any dispute or complaint relating to our participation in the US-EU or US-Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks is subject to the Dispute Resolution section of our Privacy Policy before being subject to this Section.

**9.4 Selection of Arbitrator.**

**How the arbitrator will be selected.**

We each agree to use the “rank and strike” process for selecting an arbitrator.  In this process, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will propose at least ten candidates to potentially serve as the arbitrator.  We will each respond directly to AAA (without copying one another) in a writing that (i) “strikes” up to three of those candidates, that is, removes them from further consideration, and (ii) ranks the remaining candidates in order of preference. AAA will average each of our rankings for each arbitrator and select as the arbitrator the candidate with the highest ranking. 

**9.5 No Class Actions.**

**We both agree to not bring a class action.**

1. YOU AND EVENTBRITE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 9.9 BELOW, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY (IF WARRANTED) ISSUE ALL OF THE SAME RELIEF THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT, INCLUDING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, IN FAVOR OF THE PARTY SEEKING SUCH RELIEF, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND WARRANTED BY THE PARTY’S CLAIMS. 
    

You and we each acknowledge that different arbitrations may present overlapping factual or legal issues. As such, to the fullest allowable extent, and subject to Section 9.9 below, you and we each agree that in the event one of you or us initiates an arbitration against the other and we determine, in our sole discretion, that such arbitration presents one or more questions of fact or law that are also at issue in a pending arbitration between us and a third party (a “Similar Arbitration”), the arbitration involving you will, at our request, be assigned to the same arbitrator presiding over the Similar Arbitration and/or be paused until the Similar Arbitration is resolved. Any rulings in any Similar Arbitration will not be binding in the arbitration involving you.

**9.6 Dispute Notice.**

**Notice must be given when one of us intends to seek arbitration.**

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice to Eventbrite must be addressed to the following address ("Notice Address") and must be sent by certified mail: Eventbrite, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 95 Third Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, California, 94103 USA. Dispute Notices to you will be addressed to a mailing, home, or payment address currently on record with Eventbrite and must be sent by certified mail. If we have no records of a physical address, our Dispute Notice may be delivered to your Eventbrite account email address. The Dispute Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Eventbrite and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Dispute Notice is sent, you or Eventbrite may commence an arbitration proceeding.

**9.7 Arbitration Rules.**

**These are the rules that will govern any arbitration proceedings**.

The arbitration will be governed by the [Commercial Arbitration Rules](https://www.adr.org/Rules), or, if the actions giving rise to the dispute or claim relate to your personal use of the Services (rather than business use), the [Consumer Arbitration Rules](https://www.adr.org/Rules) (in each case, the "AAA Rules") of the AAA, as modified by this Section 9, and will be administered by the AAA and settled by a single arbitrator. (The AAA Rules are also available by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) All issues in dispute between the parties are for the arbitrator to decide, including, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 9.

**9.8 Arbitration Location.**

**This is where the arbitration will take place.**

If you are a Consumer, any arbitration hearings will take place (at your option) either in the county of your residence or by phone, except that (1) if you are a Consumer whose residence is outside of the United States, the hearing will take place either in San Francisco, California or by phone or videoconference, at your option and as permitted by the AAA Rules; and (2) in the case of Batch arbitration per Section 9.9 below, the hearing will take place either in San Francisco, California or by phone or videoconference, at the option of AAA. If your use of the Services is or was for commercial use, then unless Eventbrite and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the United States in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, or in the case of Batch arbitration per Section 9.9 belowAAA will determine the location. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator or through a telephonic hearing. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All decisions by the arbitrator will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

**9.9** **Similar Claims.**

**Similar claims brought by the same or coordinated counsel will be batched together for efficient resolution.**  

To ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 25 or more claimants submit Dispute Notices or file arbitrations raising similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts or events and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be arbitrated in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”). Specifically, upon notice from either side, AAA must group the arbitrations into: (1) a single Batch (if there are 25-50 claimants), or (2) Batches of 50 claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 50 claimants). AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by AAA, one set of aArbitration fFees, and one hearing (if any) per Batch, to be held in San Francisco, California, or by phone or videoconference at the option of the arbitrator. We both agree to cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration. Any challenges to administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator. If this Section 9.9 is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it will be severed as to that claimant or Batch, and those parties must arbitrate in individual proceedings.

**9.10 Arbitration Costs.**

**This is how we decide who’s responsible for the costs of arbitration and legal fees.**

1. Payment of Costs and Expenses. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA Rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against Eventbrite and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then Eventbrite will advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). Further, if you are initiating an arbitration against Eventbrite and your claim arises from your use of the Services as a Consumer, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be more expensive than a court proceeding, then Eventbrite will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses. In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration were frivolous at the time they were filed or that you continued to press those claims even after receiving information demonstrating that such claims were frivolous, you agree to reimburse Eventbrite for all of the costs and expenses that Eventbrite paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA Rules.
    
2. Payment of Legal Fees. To the maximum extent allowed under applicable law, each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement of attorneys' fees and expenses upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
    

**9.11 Non-Qualifying Disputes.**

**Disputes that can’t be arbitrated in accordance with this Section 9 will be governed by Section 21.**

In the event that any provisions of this Section 9 are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any claim or issue, then the entirety of this Section 9 will be null and void only with respect to such claim or issue and Section 21 “Applicable Law and Jurisdiction” will apply to such claim or issue in lieu of this Section 9.  For the avoidance of doubt, for all claims and/or issues as to which this Section 9 is not found to be invalid or unenforceable: (a) this Section 9 shall apply in full to all such claims and/or issues, and (b) arbitration of all such claims and/or issues shall commence and be completed prior to any litigation on any non-arbitrable claims, including in the event that arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims or issues present overlapping factual and/or legal questions.  

**9.12 Your Right to Opt Out.**

**If you want to opt out of our agreement to arbitrate, you must notify us in time.**

You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration or class action waiver provisions set forth above in this Section 9 by sending (from the email address we associate with you as a User) written notice of your decision to opt-out to [legal@eventbrite.com](mailto:legal@eventbrite.com).  Please include the following in the  subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or your agreement to these Terms (whichever is later); otherwise, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these provisions. Note that if you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Eventbrite also will not be bound by them.

### 13\. Scraping or Commercial Use of Site Content is Prohibited

**13.1 You can’t use our content for your own purposes.**

You have no right to use, and you agree not to use, any Site Content for your own commercial purposes. You have no right to, and you agree not to, scrape, crawl, or employ any automated means to extract data from the Sites.

### 14\. Fees and Refunds.

**14.1 Fees.**

**We charge the following fees.**

Creating an account is free. However, we charge fees to list an event and to buy/sell paid tickets or registrations. These fees may vary based on individual agreements between us and certain Organizers. In some cases, Organizers may determine whether these fees will be passed along to Consumers and shown as "Fees" on the applicable event page or absorbed into the ticket or registration price and paid by the Organizer out of ticket and registration gross proceeds. The fees charged to Consumers may include other charges, including facility fees, royalties, taxes, processing fees, and fulfillment fees. This means that the fees paid by Consumers for an event are not necessarily the same as those charged by us to the applicable Organizer or the standard fees described on the Services to Organizers. In addition, some fees are meant to defray costs incurred by us, but may in some cases include an element of profit and in some cases include an element of loss. We do not control (and cannot disclose) fees levied by your bank and/or credit card company, including fees for purchasing tickets and registrations in foreign currencies or from foreign persons. Be sure to check with your bank or credit card company prior to purchasing to understand all applicable fees, credit card surcharges, and currency conversion rates.

**14.2 Ticket Transfers.**

**You may be able to transfer your ticket.** 

If you wish to transfer tickets to an event you have purchased on the Site, please contact the Organizer of the event to arrange for ticket transfer. If you are unable to reach the Organizer, or the Organizer is unable to arrange a ticket transfer, please [contact us](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/contact-us/) and we might be able to accommodate this for you.

**14.3 Refund Requests.**

**Consumers requesting a refund should contact the Organizer. Consumers must not use a ticket that has been refunded, and Organizers must not accept invalid tickets.**

1. Because all transactions are between an Organizer and its Consumers, we ask that all Consumers contact the applicable Organizer of their event with any refund requests. You can find help with getting a refund [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/721549/can-i-get-a-refund/).
    
2. If you are a Consumer and you receive a refund for your ticket, you will discard the ticket and will not use it (or any copy of it) to attend the event. Violation of this is fraud.
    
3. If you are an Organizer, you acknowledge that the applicable procedure to check the validity of the ticket must always be followed, including [checking in Consumers](https://www.eventbrite.com/help/en-us/articles/741083/how-to-check-in-attendees-at-the-event-with-eventbrite-organizer/) with the Eventbrite app for organizers.
    
4. We will not be liable under any circumstances for any costs arising from Organizers’ non-compliance with the procedures that must be implemented by Organizers to check the validity of tickets. We will not be liable under any circumstances for costs and/or damage arising from ticket-related fraud and/or the purchase of the ticket through non-official means, such as third parties.

Consider the following examples: if you submit your logo or other images associated with one of Your Eventbrite Events, we can display them on our website and resize or enhance them so that they look good on our Applications, or use them with our marketing tools to help you promote Your Eventbrite Events; we may feature details from one of Your Eventbrite Events in a blog, case study, or shareholder letter to highlight the impact made by Your Eventbrite Events.

1. You hereby waive any and all moral rights in connection with our use of Your Content in accordance with the licenses in this Section 16. Aside from these licenses, we do not claim, and you do not transfer, any ownership rights in any of Your Content or Your Trademarks and nothing in these Terms will restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit Your Content and Your Trademarks outside of the Services.

4\. We are constantly evolving our products and services to better meet the needs of our Users. Because of this, we cannot guarantee the availability of certain product features or functionality.

We may, without your consent, freely assign these Terms and our rights and obligations under these Terms, whether to an Affiliate or to another entity, in connection with a corporate transaction or otherwise.

### 20\. Entire Agreement. 

**These Terms make up our entire agreement with you unless we also enter into a separate written agreement.**

Except as otherwise stated in these Terms, these Terms are the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, discussions, or communications between you and Eventbrite on the subject matter of these Terms, other than any written agreement for Services between you and us relating to a specified event or events.

21-22
-----

### 21\. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction. 

**Disputes that can’t be resolved under our arbitration agreement will be resolved in the courts of San Francisco under California law.**

1. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law. 
    
2. Eventbrite is based in San Francisco, California. Any legal action against us related to our Services and not subject to the arbitration provisions in Section 9 of these Terms will take place in San Francisco. By agreeing to these Terms, you submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state or federal courts (as applicable) in San Francisco County, California.
    

### 22\. Feedback. 

**We have a right to use any feedback you provide us.**

We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvements to the Services, as well as feedback, comments, suggestions, and ratings regarding the services and events of third parties such as the Organizers of events you attend (collectively, "Feedback"). Any Feedback you submit to us will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, publish, and exploit those ideas and materials for any purpose, with or without your name, without compensation to you. We may collect testimonials, ratings, and reviews about Site Content, the Services, and, if you are an Organizer, Your Content and events. These testimonials, ratings and reviews will be considered Feedback. We retain full discretion on whether, when, where, with whom, and how Feedback is shared or published.

### 23\. Third Party Websites; Linked Accounts; Third Party Offers. 

**We are not responsible for third-party websites or materials that you access.**

The Services or Users may provide links to other Internet websites or resources. Because we have no control over such websites and resources, you agree that we are not responsible for the availability of such websites or resources. We do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any Site Content, advertising, offers, products, services, or other materials on or available from such websites or resources and are not responsible for any damages or losses related to them, even if such websites or resources are connected with our partners or third-party service providers. For example, if you purchase ticket insurance on the Site from a third party, your contractual relationship is with the third-party ticket insurance provider, not with us.

### 24\. Additional Miscellaneous Provisions. 

**Here’s some more legal stuff before you go.**

If we fail to enforce any part of these Terms, that will not amount to a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms. Except as expressly set out in these Terms, the exercise by us of any of our remedies under these Terms will not preclude us from exercising our other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. No oral waiver, amendment, or modification of these Terms will be effective. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. Section titles and subtitles in these Terms, along with the italicized text following them, are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect and do not amount to legal advice. When we say Eventbrite “may” or has the right, is permitted, authorized, or allowed to do something in these Terms, it means we may, but are not obligated to, exercise the applicable rights or options or take the applicable action, as we determine in our sole discretion. Any determinations, decisions, or beliefs by us under these Terms may be made by us in our sole discretion.
