Last updated: **October 26, 2023**

(“Eventbrite,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) uses cookies and other similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Sites or Applications ("Online Properties") and in the course of using any of our Services. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. Any capitalized terms that are not also defined in this Cookie Statement are defined in our Terms of Service.

What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. The term “**cookie**” is used in this Cookie Statement in the broad sense to include cookies and all similar techniques and technologies, including web beacons.  Web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Online Properties or taken an action in relation to our Online Properties. 

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Eventbrite) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

Why do we use cookies?
----------------------

Eventbrite uses first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Online Properties to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to better understand your use of our Online Properties, to track and target the interests of our Users, and to enhance the experience of Users on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Online Properties for advertising, analytics and other purposes.

Organizers can also use cookies on our Online Property to learn more about your interests in their event(s). These practices are described in more detail below.

Types of cookies we use
-----------------------

**First-party cookies**

These cookies are created by Eventbrite. They are primarily used to allow you to browse our Online Properties and use their features. They may also assist us in our analytics activities, to personalize content for you, and to show you advertisements for events that we think you might be interested in. These cookies may use non-personal data (e.g., aggregate or de-identified information about your use of the Online Properties) or information that uniquely identifies the browser or device you are using to access the Online Properties. 

**Third-party cookies**

In addition to the first-party cookies we use, some third-party companies may place cookies on your computer through our Online Properties, access those cookies, and associate web beacons with them. These cookies enable third-party features or functionalities to be provided on or through our Online Properties. The parties that set these third-party cookies can use them to recognize your device both when it visits our Online Properties and also when it visits certain other, unaffiliated websites.

**Types of first- and third-party cookies we use**

The types of first- and third-party cookies we use on our Online Properties are detailed below. Please note that the specific cookies served to your browser may vary depending on the specific Eventbrite Property you visit.  These cookies may use non-personal data (e.g., aggregate or de-identified information about your use of the Online Properties) or information that uniquely identifies the browser or device you are using to access the Online Properties.  

* **Essential cookies**: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with access to and the basic use of our Services or Online Properties, such as access to secure areas and setting your privacy preferences.  These cookies cannot be turned off.
    
* **Functionality cookies**: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Online Properties, but are not required for their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality of the Online Properties may become limited or unavailable.
    
* **Analytics cookies**: These cookies help us understand how our Online Properties are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Sites for you. We and our vendors use such technologies to collect information on a real-time basis about how you use and navigate our Services. This may include information about your browsing behavior, page visits, clicks and cursor movements and searches on our sites. The information (including your IP address) collected by these technologies will be disclosed to or collected directly by these vendors, who use the information to help us evaluate your use of the Services. With analytics cookies, we are able to improve the features offered on our Online Properties.
    
* **Advertising cookies**: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. This category includes both:
    
    * **Eventbrite Advertising**: These are first-party advertising cookies that show you advertising and measure the effectiveness of ads on Eventbrite online Properties.
        
    * **Targeted Advertising**: These are third-party advertising cookies that show you ads and measure the effectiveness of ads on both Eventbrite Online Properties and on other websites and services. Targeted Advertising cookies may include Google, Facebook, and other advertising networks and services that we may use from time to time.
        

**Organizer cookies**: Organizers selling tickets to events may use a variety of cookies on our Online Properties, including analytics and customization cookies, advertising cookies, and social media cookies.  They may use these cookies to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services in which you may be interested and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and marketing campaigns.  Please note that Eventbrite does not have access to or control the cookies that organizers chose to use.

For more information on how to allow or refuse these various types of cookies, please see “Cookie management” below.

Duration of cookies stored on your device
-----------------------------------------

The duration of storage of cookies on your device may vary, depending on the category to which they belong: temporary or permanent.

**Temporary or Session cookies**

We use temporary cookies on our Online Properties to allow you to browse our Online Properties without interruption. We may also use temporary cookies for internal reporting purposes. After your browsing session ends, this type of cookie does not store any information on your hard drive.

**Persistent cookies**

Some of our first-party analytics cookies and certain third-party cookies are persistent cookies. They allow us and third parties to understand visitors’ browsing behaviour over a longer period of time, to provide you with additional features related to your use of the Online Properties, the content that you have saved or stored through them, as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. Depending on their function, this type of cookie may persist for different lengths of time ranging from several hours, to a week, or even several years. This type of cookie will persist after you end a browsing session and can be used by our Online Properties or third parties to recognize your device when you begin a new browsing session.
