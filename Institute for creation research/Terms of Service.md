Ethical Use Policy
==================

  
Except as otherwise allowed by applicable law (such as the “fair use” exception governed by U.S. copyright law), nothing in ICR's published materials (in printed or electronic form) may be reprinted or reproduced in other publications, for other media, or on other websites in whole or in part beyond these guidelines without obtaining [permission from ICR](mailto:permissions@icr.org?subject=Permission%20request%20to%20use%20ICR%27s%20content). This applies to textual content, graphics, audio and video, etc.

* * *

**General Guidelines**

1\. You may print or photocopy pages in whole as evangelistic tools for churches, schools, etc.

2\. You may quote up to 100 words, or rephrase or summarize our information for noncommercial, educational use provided you include the proper references each time our information is used.

* * *

**Avoid Plagiarism**

Please bear in mind that if you plagiarize content from someone else's work, you are essentially stealing credit from that person. Following these guidelines will allow you to use well-documented information in your own ministry, while at the same time showing the respect and courtesy due to the original author.

1. Place quotation marks around anything you quote directly. Do not quote more than 100 words without first obtaining [permission.](mailto:permissions@icr.org?subject=Permission%20request%20to%20use%20ICR%27s%20content)
2. Document where you found the quoted material. For example, reference information could be included in a footnote: "Creation cannot get a fair hearing in the marketplace of ideas."\[1\]
3. Provide a reference for information that is rephrased or summarized. For example: The press is biased in their reporting of evolution and creation news.\[1\]
4. Common knowledge does not need to be referenced. Information that is widely known (such as that found in reference books) is considered common knowledge. Example: Operational science makes predictions about events in the future, not historical events in the past.

Sample footnote:

\[1\] Morris, H. M. 2003. Willingly Ignorant. _Acts & Facts_. 32 (12).

Note: Articles that are referenced online should also include a link to the relevant ICR web page. For the above reference, the link is [http://icr.org/article/491/](http://icr.org/article/491/).

* * *

**RSS Feeds**  
_Consider using ICR RSS feeds_

Since ICR does not allow articles to be republished without permission, we offer RSS feeds as a convenient solution for those who wish to feature ICR materials on their websites. The feeds provide the opening information for each item, with a link to the full feature on the ICR website.

* * *

**Reprinting ICR Materials**

Permission must be obtained to reprint any ICR materials beyond the 100-word limit mentioned above. If you wish to use all or part of an ICR publication, please provide specific information on how it will be used.

For use in a book, provide:

1. book title
2. page count
3. publisher
4. publication date
5. intended audience
6. context in which the ICR material will be used
7. where the book will be sold
8. proposed price
9. format (print, electronic, etc.)
10. binding

For use in a magazine, provide:

1. magazine title
2. readership count
3. publication schedule
4. projected publication date
5. magazine website address (if any)
6. editor's contact information
7. sale price of the magazine
8. magazine format (size, page count, binding, color or B/W, etc.)

For use in other venues, please provide relevant information that is commensurate with that listed above.

[Click here](mailto:permissions@icr.org?subject=Permission%20request%20to%20use%20ICR%27s%20content) to request permission to reprint ICR materials.

* * *

**Translating ICR Materials**

We are unable to provide permission to translate ICR publications or resources. We appreciate your understanding.

* * *

A Note to Our Readers:
----------------------

For stewardship purposes, we will not be able to write, edit, or proofread science papers and projects, assist with homework assignments, evaluate personal theories and hypotheses, or review books and other resources. We also will not accept unsolicited manuscripts, nor are we able to provide unsolicited endorsements of books, products, or ministries.
