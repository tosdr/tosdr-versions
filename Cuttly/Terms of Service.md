The Service Provider informs the Service Users of planned technical interruptions in advance, also indicating the expected duration of the planned interruption.
* 5\. The Service Provider is not liable to the Service User for any damages or failure to fulfill obligations resulting from all errors and technical failures and technical interruptions mentioned in this point 19 of the Terms and Conditions.

    * c.

    * d. If the report includes electronic contact data of the person or entity making the report, the Service Provider promptly sends confirmation of receipt of the report to such person or entity. The Service Provider also notifies such person or entity without undue delay of its decision regarding the information concerned by the report, providing information about the possibility of appealing the decision.
    * e. The Service Provider considers all reports received under the mechanism described above and makes decisions regarding the information concerned by the reports in a timely, non-arbitrary, and objective manner, with due diligence. If the Service Provider uses automated means for such consideration or decision-making, it includes information about this in the notification mentioned in the previous point.
* 4\. **Information about the restrictions that the Service Provider imposes in relation to the use of the Online Service regarding the information submitted by Users**:
    * a. The following rules apply to Users when submitting any content within the Online Service:
        * I. The obligation to use the Online Service, including posting content, in accordance with its intended purpose, these Regulations, and in a manner consistent with the law and good manners, taking into account the respect for personal rights and copyright and intellectual property rights of the Service Provider and third parties;
        * II. The obligation to introduce content that is consistent with the facts and in a manner that does not mislead;
        * III. The prohibition of providing unlawful content, including the prohibition of delivering Illegal Content;
        * IV. The prohibition of sending unsolicited commercial information (spam) through the Online Service;
        * V. The prohibition of providing content that violates generally accepted netiquette rules, including content that is vulgar or offensive;
        * VI. The obligation to possess – where necessary – all required rights and permissions to deliver such content on the pages of the Online Service, especially copyrights or required licenses, permissions, and consents for their use, distribution, making available, or publication, particularly the right to publish and distribute in the Online Store and the right to use and distribute the image or personal data in the case of content that includes the image or personal data of third parties.
        * VII. The obligation to use the Online Service in a way that does not endanger the security of the Service Provider's information technology system, the Online Service, or third parties.
    * b. The Service Provider reserves the right to moderate content provided by Users on the Online Service's site. Moderation is conducted in good faith and with due diligence, either on the Service Provider's own initiative or upon receiving a report, in order to detect, identify, and remove Illegal Content or other content not in compliance with the Regulations, or to block access to them or take necessary measures to meet the requirements of European Union law and national law consistent with European Union law, including the requirements specified in the Digital Services Act, or the requirements contained in the Regulations.
    * c. The moderation process may be carried out manually by a human or rely on automated or partially automated tools that facilitate the Service Provider's identification of Illegal Content or other content not in compliance with the Regulations. Upon identifying such content, the Service Provider decides whether to remove or block access to the content or otherwise limit its visibility or take other necessary actions (e.g., contacting the User to clarify concerns and change content). The Service Provider will inform the User who provided the content (if their contact information is available) about their decision, the reasons for making it, and available options for appealing this decision in a clear and easily understandable manner.
    * d. In exercising its rights and obligations under the Digital Services Act, the Service Provider is required to act with due diligence, in an objective and proportionate manner, and with due consideration for the rights and legally justified interests of all involved parties, including service recipients, particularly with respect to rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, such as freedom of expression, media freedom and pluralism, and other fundamental rights and freedoms.
* 5\. Any comments, complaints, claims, appeals, or reservations concerning decisions or other actions or inactions taken by the Service Provider based on the received report or the Service Provider's decision made in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations can be reported in a manner analogous to the complaint procedure indicated in section 16 of the Regulations and – for registered Users – through an automated appeal form. Utilizing this procedure is free of charge and enables electronic submission of complaints to the specified email address. Use of the complaint reporting and consideration procedure does not affect the right of the person or entity to initiate legal proceedings and does not infringe on their other rights.
* 6\. The Service Provider considers all comments, complaints, claims, appeals, or reservations concerning decisions or other actions or inactions taken by the Service Provider based on the received report or the decision made in a timely, non-discriminatory, objective, and non-arbitrary manner. If a complaint or other notification contains sufficient reasons for the Service Provider to believe that its decision not to take action in response to a report is unjustified, or that the information subject to the complaint is not illegal and not in compliance with the Regulations, or contains information indicating that the action of the complainant does not justify the measure taken, the Service Provider without undue delay revokes or changes its decision regarding the potential removal or blocking access to the content or otherwise limiting their visibility or takes other necessary actions.
* 7\. Users, individuals, or entities that have reported Illegal Content, to whom the Service Provider's decisions regarding Illegal Content or content not in compliance with the Regulations are directed, have the right to choose any out-of-court dispute resolution body certified by the digital services coordinator of the member state to resolve disputes concerning these decisions, including in relation to complaints that have not been resolved within the Service Provider's internal complaint consideration system.
