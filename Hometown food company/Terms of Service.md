All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the Hometown Food Website will first be raised for informal resolution. Any such disputes, claims or controversies that are not resolved by mutual agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration, on an individual basis, to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in Chicago, Illinois before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in these Terms of Use. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Terms of Use and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Use, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIM TO SUCH DAMAGES. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding.

Any issues or challenges relating to the arbitrators’ jurisdiction and arbitrability to the arbitrator will be governed by Rule 11(c) of the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.

Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**Miscellaneous**

The failure of Hometown Food to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit Hometown Food’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breach. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify this Agreement. Hometown Food may assign its rights and duties hereunder to any party at any time without any notice to you. This Agreement may not be assigned by you without Hometown Food’s prior written consent. If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This Agreement may not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties.
