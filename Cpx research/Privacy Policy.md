#### 2\. Legal bases for processing

We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.

These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:

* it's necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);
* it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;
* you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or
* we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation

Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).

We don't keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

Your data will be processed in accordance with the following legal provisions:

* In relation to data submitted in forms, surveys, etc. with your consent, Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR
* With regard to the services that you use to fulfill the contract, Article 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR applies

The personal information we collect is stored and processed in Germany, where we or our partners, affiliates, and third-party providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal information, you consent to the disclosure to these overseas third parties.

We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.

Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.

If you are situated in China, please be aware that your personal information will be processed in countries outside of China, such as the USA and EU. This processing may occur due to our affiliates who have entrusted us with the distribution of their surveys or the presence of other Company affiliates, agents, or contractors in these regions. If you require more details, feel free to reach out to us at any time.

### LGPD PRIVACY NOTICE

**PRIVACY STATEMENT-BRAZIL**

This Privacy Notice for users located in Brazil supplements the information contained in the Make Opinion GmbH Privacy Policy and applies solely to visitors, users, and others who reside in Brazil ("consumers" or "you"). We adopt this notice to comply with the Brazilian Data Protection Law Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (Law No. 13,709/2018) (“LGPD”). Any terms defined in the LGPD have the same meaning when used in this notice.

**LGPD**

On September 18, 2020, the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) came into effect for Brazilian residents. In addition to the rights outlined in our Privacy Policy, as a user located in Brazil, you may be able to exercise the following rights with respect to the personal information that we have collected, subject to certain limitations:

* **The right to confirmation of the existence of the processing.** You have the right to ask that we confirm whether we process your personal data.
* **The right to access the data.** You have the right to access the personal data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with, including information about any public and private entities we have shared your personal data with. 
* **The right to correct incomplete, inaccurate, or out-of-date data.** If you want to correct or revise any of the data we retain on you, you may do so by accessing your account and the information contained within it or contacting our team.
* **The right to anonymize, block or delete unnecessary or excessive data or data that is not being processed in compliance with the LGPD.** Please note that, depending on the request, this may result in a suspension or discontinuation of certain services and may be governed by legal and/or contractual retention guidelines.
* **The right to the portability of data to another service or product provider, by means of an express request.** We provide you with the ability to move any of your account data to a third party, at any time.
* **The right to delete personal data processed with the consent of the data subject.** You have a right to request the permanent deletion of your data, subject to certain exceptions. However, please note that exercising this right may result in a suspension or discontinuation of services and may also be governed by legal and/or contractual retention guidelines.

**Please note that not all of these rights listed above are absolute, and limitations/exceptions apply in some cases. For example, we may not be able to fully comply with your request if we are bound by certain legal restrictions or contractual requirements, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision.**

_Exercising Data Portability and Deletion Rights_

To exercise the data portability and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us: privacy@makeopinion.com

We will need to verify your identity before processing your request. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or a legal representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

_Response Timing and Format_

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 15 days of its receipt but no more than 30 days. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request.

If you have provided data to Make Opinion GmbH regarding a client of yours, which is subject to the LGPD, you are responsible for obtaining the proper consent from such clients prior to sharing their personal information with us. 

**Changes to Our Privacy Notice**

We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time.

When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will notify you by email or through a notice on our website homepage.

Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalize your content (eg. advertising, language).

Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as "first-party cookies", and typically only track your activity on that particular site.

This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you.
