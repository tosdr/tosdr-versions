========

We do a lot to keep your data safe. While we think we have strong defenses in place, no one can ever guarantee that hackers won’t be able to break into our sites or steal your data while it is stored or flowing from you to us or vice versa.  
  
We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, and misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Your personal information will be accessible by our employees, contractors and service providers who require access for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

If you are reading this Privacy Notice in a country where we have a separate Cookies Policy, you will see the Cookie Banner that applies to you each time you visit the site.

The following additional information applies across all of our websites and apps.

Digital cookies and similar technologies help us make our services better to use by doing things like recognizing when you’ve signed in, analyzing how you use our services so we can make them more useful to you, giving you a more personalized experience.

When you interact with our online services, or open emails we send you, we obtain certain information using automated technologies, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that may be used in our websites or emails.

We use these automated technologies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and inferences as described above. These technologies help us to:

* Remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it;
* Track and understand how you use and interact with our online services and emails;
* Tailor our online services to your preferences;
* Measure how useful and effective our services and communications are to you; and
* Otherwise manage and enhance our products and services.

We set some of these automated technologies ourselves, but others are set by third parties who deliver services on our behalf. For example, we may use other companies’ web analytics services (described in the [“Third-Party Analytics Services”](https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/privacy#third) section above), which use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers use our websites. Some of these technologies may also be set by third parties that help us advertise our products and services to you as informed by your interests, based on information collected from your activity on the web, including but not limited to, browsing or purchasing products on or through our websites or on third party websites or your activity on mobile sites and applications. This advertising approach is called interest-based advertising or “targeted advertising.”

##### Your Personal Information Rights

Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may be entitled under applicable law to request:

If we learn that any information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 18, we will promptly delete that information.

ADDITIONAL JURISDICTIONAL DISCLOSURES
=====================================

### EU/UK

##### Personal Information

* to be provided with access to your personal data held by us;
* to request the rectification or erasure of your personal data held by us;
* to request that we cease processing your data;
* to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data (while we verify or investigate your concerns with this information, for example);

In order to exercise any of these rights (including the right to withdraw your consent), please email privacy-eu@squareup.com. We may need to verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information.

##### International Data Transfers

We operate in many countries, and we (or our service providers) may move your data and process it outside the country where you live. We use third-party service providers to process and store your information in the United States, Japan, the EU, and other countries. When we transfer your personal data to our affiliates outside the EU, we make use of standard contractual clauses (which have been approved by the European Commission) to help ensure your information is afforded a high standard of protection, and that your privacy rights can be vindicated. For a list of the countries in which we operate, please see https://squareup.com/gb/about.

You can also access the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc\_en.

### AUSTRALIA

Square complies with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)(**Privacy Act**) and with the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (**APPs**) in the Privacy Act, as well as with this Privacy Policy.

We may share your information with Cuscal Limited, an Authorised Deposit-Taking Institution (ADI) supervised by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). Cuscal supports our provision of the Services through its banking and payments services and may not be able to provide its services without information about you. Cuscal’s privacy policy is available via www.cuscal.com.au/privacy-policy and sets out details about Cuscal’s collection, use and disclosure of information about you, as well as information about your rights to access your personal information.

### JAPAN

We may share your information with a third party outside of Japan, including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, the EU, and in other countries. We may use some cloud service providers located in the United States and Japan. We are unable to specify all possible jurisdictions Personal Data of users of Square services in Japan would be transferred or stored, as service providers use multiple servers located in multiple jurisdictions and do not disclose all of these locations for security reasons.

You may contact our privacy team with any requests of disclosure, correction, or deletion of your personal information. You may also request suspension of use or suspension of sharing of your personal information with certain third parties. Please contact our privacy team at the address listed below under “Contact.” We may request to verify your identity before processing your request.

### UNITED STATES

###### **California**

Privacy laws that apply in certain places, like California, treat “businesses” and “service providers” differently. Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information. A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services. When Square processes Your Customers’ Data, we generally act as your service provider. In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customers’ Data. For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customers’ Data to send your customers digital receipts directly from Square, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or Square Marketing to contact your buyer using a masked email address (for example, j\*\*\*\*\*@gmail.com) that gets routed to them via Square. Your customers can visit the [Privacy Notice for Square Buyer Features](https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/buyer-features) for more information on how Square processes their data when it is acting as a business.

Even though you use our services while acting as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietor of a business, nonprofit, or government agency, if you live in California, California law gives you the right to ask if we disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (we do not disclose your personal information for others’ direct marketing purposes).

Please see [CCPA Privacy Requests Metrics](https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/ccpa-metrics) for details on the number of Access, Deletion, and Do Not Share My Information requests that we received and processed in the last year.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE
==============================

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice from time to time, as may be required. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any material changes in how we use your information, including by email if you have provided one. If you disagree with these changes, you may cancel your account at any time. Any amendments will be published by posting a revised version of the Privacy Notice and updating the “Effective Date” above. The revised version will be effective on the “Effective Date” listed.
