### 1\. Our Services

We provide a platform that enables businesses and individuals to create automated chat flows that they can deploy across a wide range of messaging services, social media and other third-party platforms.

If you purchase or use our Services, you’re doing so through Manychat, and such purchase and use is subject to this Agreement; provided, that if you’ve entered into a separate agreement or order form with us governing the purchase or use of our Services, such separate agreement or order form will govern in the event of a conflict with this Agreement.

### 2\. Account, Password, Security, and Phone Use

You must register with Manychat and create an account to use the Services (an “**Account**”) and as part of that process you will be requested to provide certain information, including without limitation your name, phone number and email address, which may be provided by linking certain services, including without limitation Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp or Telegram, to your Account.  By using the Services, you agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information as prompted by the registration process and to maintain and promptly update the Account information to keep it accurate, current and complete. You are the sole authorized user of your Account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any login and password provided by you or given to you by Manychat for accessing the Services. You are solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or Account, even if not authorized by you.  Users are responsible for the content users upload to their Account and use of any user’s Account, and Manychat expressly disclaims any liability derived therefrom. Should you suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your password or Account or you suspect any other breach of security, you agree to contact Manychat immediately.

The person signing up for the Services will be the contracting party (“**Account Representative**”) for the purposes of these Terms of Service and will be the person who is authorized to use any corresponding Account we provide to the Account Representative in connection with the Services; provided, however, that if you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer, your employer shall be the Account Representative. As the Account Representative, you are solely responsible for complying with these Terms of Service and only you are entitled to all benefits accruing thereto. Your Account is not transferable to any other person or account.  If you are an Agency (as defined below) using our Services to provide services to a Business Owner (as defined below), please read Section 3 below.

By providing your phone number and email address and by using the Services, you hereby affirmatively consent to Manychat’s use of your phone number for calls and recurring texts (including with an autodialer and/or prerecorded voice) and your email address in order to (i) perform and improve upon the Services, (ii) facilitate the carrying out of our Services, and (iii) provide you with information and reminders regarding your registration, changes and updates, service outages, or alterations. These calls and messages may include, among other things, push notifications and other reminders delivered through our App.  Manychat will not assess any charges for calls or texts, but standard message, data or other charges from your wireless carrier may apply. You may opt-out of receiving calls or messages from us by modifying your Account settings on the Site or the App, by stating that you no longer wish to receive calls or messages from us during any call with us, or by visiting [www.manychat.com/support](https://manychat.com/support) and specifying you want to opt-out of calls or messages. You understand that we may send you a message confirming any opt-out by you.

### 3\. Agencies and Business Owners

A “**Business Owner**” is any individual or entity that uses Manychat’s Services to market, support, develop, or otherwise commercialize their business, services, or products.  An “**Agency**” is any service provider retained or hired by a Business Owner to create and/or manage a Manychat account and use the Services on the Business Owner’s behalf.  An Agency is not required for a Business Owner to use the Services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 2, if you are an Agency using our Services to provide services to a Business Owner, you (i) agree to correctly identify such Business Owner as an administrator on the Account and, if applicable, on the applicable Facebook page, Instagram page, WhatsApp page, Telegram page and on any other applicable page on any other applicable platform, and (ii) confirm you are authorized to use the Services and the Account on behalf of the Business Owner.

The Business Owner shall be the sole and exclusive account representative of any Account created on its behalf by an Agency; provided that the Agency shall maintain its rights and interests in and to all designs, templates, flows, sequences, or other intellectual property associated with the chatbot automation work product created by such Agency for the Business Owner (such work product, the “**Agency Content**”).

In the event of a termination of the relationship between a Business Owner and its Agency, the Business Owner will promptly notify Manychat of such termination.

Following the transfer of an Account from an Agency to the Business Owner, the Business Owner shall be solely responsible for the payment of any subscription plans and/or fees due with respect to the Account.

### 4\. User Generated Content

“**User Generated Content**” is defined as any content, information, and materials that may be textual, audio, or visual that you or any Conversation Participant provide, submit, upload, publish, or make otherwise available to the Services and our users. You are solely responsible for your and your Conversation Participants’ User Generated Content, and we act merely as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of User Generated Content. You acknowledge and agree that Manychat:

* Is not involved in the creation or development of User Generated Content.
* Disclaims any responsibility for User Generated Content.
* Cannot be liable for claims arising out of or relating to User Generated Content.
* Is not obligated to monitor, review, or remove User Generated Content, but reserves the right to limit or remove User Generated Content on the Services at its sole discretion.

You hereby represent and warrant to Manychat that your User Generated Content (i) will not be false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading; (ii) will not infringe on any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right or rights of publicity, personality or privacy; (iii) will not violate any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation (including without limitation those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, false advertising, anti-spam or privacy); (iv) will not be defamatory, libelous, unlawfully threatening, or unlawfully harassing; (v) will not be obscene or contain pornography (including but not limited to child pornography) or be harmful to minors; (vi) will not contain any viruses, Trojan Horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; (vii) will not represent you being employed or directly engaged by or affiliated with Manychat or purport that you are authorized to act as a representative or agent of Manychat; and (viii) will not create liability for Manychat or cause Manychat to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs or other suppliers.

By making available any User Generated Content through the Services, you hereby grant to Manychat permission to use, process or disclose such User Generated Content on, through or by means of the Services, for the purposes of providing the Services to you, modifying, improving and operating the Services and/or as otherwise permitted by this Agreement. We do not claim any ownership rights in any such User Generated Content and nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit any such User Generated Content.

### 5\. Communication by Text Message or Email

If you would like to communicate with your users via text message or email, you hereby agree to the following Compliance and Indemnity Terms (“**CIT**”). You are required to use the Services in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation, all state, provincial and federal laws specifically including but not limited to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of the United States, as amended (“**TCPA**”); the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of Canada (“**PIPEDA**”), and any substantially similar provincial privacy laws; and Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, (“**CASL**”), all as may be amended (the TCPA, PIPEDA and CASL are collectively referred to as the “**Electronic Messaging Laws**”). By making any use of the Services, you expressly warrant that you are and shall continue to act in full compliance with the law.

You agree that you have read and understand the Electronic Messaging Laws and any similar state or provincial/territorial laws, and all other applicable laws and regulations. You understand that in some cases, applicable state and local restrictions are more restrictive than the federal rules. You should review these rules with your own legal counsel to ensure that you understand and comply. Manychat will not assume responsibility for ensuring that your activities meet applicable legal requirements. Manychat will not assume any liability if you are ever held guilty or found liable for any violation of law, rule or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that Manychat has and is taking active steps to help support the compliance of its customers, including by having you agree to these Terms of Service.

You understand and acknowledge that it is generally a violation of federal law, including the TCPA, to contact a consumer by phone, text or email without prior express written consent. Manychat is not responsible for ensuring that you do not transmit messages to consumers, including by telephone or email in violation of the consent rules.

You understand and acknowledge that it is generally a violation of the federal law of Canada, including CASL, to contact a consumer by text message, phone, electronic messaging, or email without prior express written consent. You will not contact any individual through the Services or about the Services unless you have established consent to do so in accordance with the applicable law. You will provide proof of such consents or opt-ins, the messages you have sent, and your implementation of unsubscribe requests to us upon our request. You will include all content required under the applicable laws in your messages, including your name, mailing address, email, telephone or web address, and the ability to unsubscribe. You will not send any messages to any individual using the Services if the individual has opted out or withdrawn their consent, including if they have replied “STOP”, or similar, to one of your previous messages. You, not Manychat, are solely responsible for the content of your messages, and its compliance with all applicable law. You acknowledge and agree that Manychat acts solely as a service provider to allow the sending of your messages, but that you exercise control over the message content and destination and must ensure your messages comply with all applicable laws.

Manychat is not responsible for ensuring that you do not transmit messages to consumers, including by text message, telephone or email in violation of the consent rules.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Manychat, along with its owners, members, directors, officers, agents, employees, contractors, consultants and vendors from and against any and all claims, suits, fines, costs, expenses, judgments and fees, including reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs and expenses, arising out of a claim alleging any violation by you of the law, or alleging facts that would constitute a breach of your warranties or obligations contained in these Terms of Service, including this CIT. You will promptly indemnify, defend or settle, any such third-party claim, demand, lawsuit, investigation or proceeding brought against Manychat. Manychat will:

* promptly notify you of such claim;
* provide you with reasonable information, assistance and cooperation in defending the lawsuit or proceeding; and
* give you control and authority over the defense and settlement of such claim, subject to Manychat’s approval of any such settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

### 6\. Communication with Manychat and its Clients

You verify that any contact information provided to Manychat and its clients, including, but not limited to, your email address and phone number, is true and accurate. You further verify that you are the telephone or email subscriber and/or that you own any telephone numbers and/or email addresses that you provide to Manychat and its clients. You acknowledge that by voluntarily providing your telephone numbers and/or email addresses to Manychat and its clients, you expressly agree to be contacted at the telephone numbers and/or email addresses you provide. You consent to receive emails, text messages, pre-recorded voice messages and/or autodialed calls by or on behalf of Manychat and its clients relating to this agreement, any transaction with Manychat and its clients, matters related to your account, and promotions from Manychat and its clients. These communications may be made by or on behalf of Manychat and its clients, even if your phone number is registered on any state, provincial, territorial or federal Do Not Call list. You acknowledge that you may incur a charge for these texts or calls by your telephone carrier and that Manychat and its clients will not be responsible for these charges.

We preserve the right to limit access to the platform for users whose actions result in degrading the experience of other platform users, Manychat’s employees, affiliates, or partners or the employees, affiliates, or partners of any other platform, including without limitation, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram.

Unless we separately agree with you that you will receive an invoice from us for the Services that requires you to pay us directly, payment and any other expenses must be paid through the third party payment processing system (the “**PSP**”) as indicated on the Services. You may be required to register with the PSP, agree to terms of service of the PSP, provide your payment details to the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up an account with the PSP (the “**PSP Services Agreement**”).

Please note that Manychat is not a party to the PSP Services Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Services Agreement are the parties to the PSP Services Agreement and that Manychat has no obligations, responsibility or liability to any user or any other party under the PSP Services Agreement.

All prices and fees displayed on the Services are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services or other taxes, fees or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“**Taxes**”).  Any applicable Taxes are based on the rates applicable to the billing address you provide to us and will be calculated at the time a transaction is charged to your Account.  Unless otherwise indicated, all prices, fees and other charges are in U.S. dollars, and all payments shall be in U.S. currency.

Our charges for subscription plans (monthly, annual, or other period, as applicable from time to time) and fees for any additional Services are posted on the Site and may be changed from time to time. If you have signed up for a Manychat subscription plan (each a, “**Subscription Plan**”) and any part of a month, year, or other period is included in the Term, then payment will be due for the full month, full year, or full other period, as applicable. Payments for monthly Subscription Plans are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day you made your first monthly payment, and Payments for yearly Subscription Plans are due for any year on the same or closest date to the day you made your first yearly payment.

You’ll replace the information for any credit card that expires with information for a valid one. Anyone using a credit card represents and warrants that they are authorized to use that credit card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that credit card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process your credit card order, we’ll try to contact you by email and will suspend your account until your payment can be processed.

We’ll give you a refund for all or a portion of a prepaid month or year, as applicable, if we stop providing our Services to you for a reason that’s not laid out in these Terms as determined by Manychat in its sole discretion.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND Manychat CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND Manychat TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to your use of the Services, you will contact us by submitting your dispute or claim via [www.manychat.com/support](https://manychat.com/support), and you and Manychat will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for 30 days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery), such matter will be deemed a “Dispute” as defined below.  Except for the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief described under the “Binding Arbitration” section below, should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorneys' fees, even if you may have been entitled to them otherwise.

**Binding Arbitration.** You and Manychat agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to your use of the Services (collectively “**Disputes**”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. **This means that you and Manychat both agree to waive the right to a trial by jury.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring a claim against Manychat in “small claims” court, instead of by arbitration, but only if the claim is eligible under the rules of the small claims court and is brought in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis, and only for so long as it remains in the small claims court and in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis.

**Class Action Waiver.** You and Manychat agree that any proceedings to resolve Disputes will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. **This means that you and Manychat both agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class action proceeding. Further, unless you and Manychat agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of class action proceeding.**

**Arbitration Administration and Rules.** The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution’ section. (The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879).

**Arbitration Process.** A party who desires to initiate the arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators with relevant experience. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with AAA Rules.

**Arbitration Location and Procedure.** Unless you and Manychat agree otherwise, the seat of the arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. If your claim does not exceed USD$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Manychat submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing, and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds USD$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by AAA Rules. Subject to AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Hearings may be conducted by telephone or video conference, if requested and agreed to by the parties.

**Arbitrator’s Decision and Governing Law.** The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will render an award within the timeframe specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be consistent with the “Disclaimer of Warranties” section above. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.

**Fees.** Each party’s responsibility to pay the arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will depend on the circumstances of the arbitration and are set forth in the AAA Rules.
