However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website.
* **Flash Cookies.** Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see Your choices about how we use and disclose your information.
* **Web Beacons.** Pages of the Website and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

**How we use your information**
-------------------------------

The information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information is used:

* In accordance with HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules (with respect to personal health information)
* To fulfill the purposes for which you provide it, including to provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us
* To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us
* To best present our Website and its contents to you
* To notify you about changes to our Website or any products or services we offer or provide though it
* To enable you to participate in interactive features on our Website if you chose to do so
* To administer and expand our business activities, including making available other products and services to you and our other customers
* To notify you about important changes to our Website, products or services or special offers that we think you will find valuable
* Call (833) 210-9591 or (833) 210-9596 with any questions

**What we may share**
---------------------

We may disclose aggregated information about our users and information that does not identify any individual.

Personal information that we collect, or that you provide, may be disclosed in the following ways:

* In accordance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules (with respect to personal health information)
* To fulfill the purposes for which you provide it
* To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business
* To enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes
* To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request
* To assist or support a third party’s theft investigation involving any of our remote monitoring or safety monitoring devices or a third party’s theft prevention efforts relating to such devices;
* To prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offenses or attacks on the technical integrity of the Website;
* To fulfill a product or service order;
* To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our users is among the assets transferred
* With your written authorization.

We may use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business operations, such third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with such business activities. 

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.

We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or authorized dealers; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, the Website, the users of the Website; or (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of the Website, us, or third parties.

We may use your personal information, such as information about your location, demographic information, medications taken, and medical conditions, to show you advertisements that we believe will be more relevant to you. Note, when we do this, we do so without telling advertisers who you are. We instead allow promotional partners to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience to develop a profile for people likely to be interested in or benefit from their products and services. We then show their advertisements to our users who match that profile.

We also provide promotional partners with reports about the performance of their advertisements to help them understand how people are interacting with their advertising content. For example, we may provide general demographic and interest information to promotional partners to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address or specific location that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. 

**Anonymized, de-identified and aggregate information**
-------------------------------------------------------

We may anonymize your personal information or de-identify personal health information in a way that meets the HIPAA de-identification standard, in each case so that the applicable data will no longer be identifiable to you. We may also combine such anonymized and de-identified information with that of other users to create aggregate anonymized and de-identified data. Any data rendered anonymous or de-identified in accordance with the foregoing ceases to be subject to the terms of this policy and becomes our property, to be used in any lawful manner at our discretion (which may include sharing such anonymized and de-identified information with our partners and/or affiliate organizations), provided in no event will we disclose or use such information in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.

**Your choices about how we use and disclose your information**

We also provide you with choices regarding the personal information you share with us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

* **Tracking Technologies.** You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
* **Your Content and Sharing Records.** If you are a registered user, the Website allows you to share your own records with others. For example, you may choose to invite your family members or friends access to your records on the Service so that they can track your progress. You understand that by giving them permission to access your records, that they will have the ability to use, reproduce, distribute, display, transmit, or publish your content. You understand that sharing your records in this manner is voluntary, done at your direction, and that you may revoke your permission given for any individual at any time.

California residents may have additional personal information rights and choices. Please see [Your California privacy rights](https://myconnectedcaregiver.com/privacy/#CA) for more information.

**Data Security**
-----------------

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information.

We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the Website. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

However, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information, or information collected from the Website. Despite our efforts to secure such information, it may be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of our physical, technical, and procedural safeguards. You use our Website at your own risk. If we learn that your personal information has been disclosed to an unauthorized person, we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about providing information in public areas of the Website, like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.

While we continue to work hard to protect personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet. Transmitting personal information over the Internet is done at your own risk. This Policy addresses only our policy and procedures. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of third parties, including but not limited to those whose web sites may be linked to the Website.

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

If we make any changes to how we treat our registered users’ personal information, we will notify you by email to the primary email address specified in your account and/or through a notice on the Website home page. The date this Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page.
