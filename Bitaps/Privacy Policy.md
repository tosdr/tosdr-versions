* You are solely responsible any consequences, losses, or damages that we may directly or indirectly incur or suffer due to any unauthorized activities conducted by you, as explained above, and may incur criminal or civil liability.
* We may provide various open communication tools on our website, such as blog comments, blog posts, public chat, forums, message boards, newsgroups, product ratings and reviews, various social media services, etc. You understand that generally we do not pre-screen or monitor the content posted by users of these various communication tools, which means that if you choose to use these tools to submit any type of content to our website, then it is your personal responsibility to use these tools in a responsible and ethical manner. By posting information or otherwise using any open communication tools as mentioned, you agree that you will not upload, post, share, or otherwise distribute any content that:

* Is illegal, threatening, defamatory, abusive, harassing, degrading, intimidating, fraudulent, deceptive, invasive, racist, or contains any type of suggestive, inappropriate, or explicit language;

We are not responsible for blockchain network or Bitcoin rate. We provide an access to the following information: amounts, addresses, description of addresses, transactions, description of transactions, blocks, description of blocks, miners, description of miners, statistic, charts, etc. Blockchain network and Bitcoin information are only for reading and can’t be cancelled, replaced, rollbacked or modified, due to the blockchain protocol standard.

Transaction fee is calculated by statistic analysis from the last 36 blocks. Transaction fee can be changed and it depends on blockchain network transaction competitions. Bitaps.com provides three transaction fee options: minimal (transaction is confirmed by approximately 3-6 blocks), optimal (transaction is confirmed by approximately 1-2 blocks) and express (estimated confirmation in next block). We are not responsible for transaction confirmation time and cannot guaranty transaction confirmation in exact blocks.  
bitaps.com servers are duplicated and backuped for maximum uptime working. We monitor, audit and control our software and hardware servers. But we cannot guaranty fulltime working and access for reasons beyond our control (e.g. hosting provider, internet network connection, blockchain network connection, DNS resolving, local restrictions and etc).  
Our server uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protection by encrypting your Personal Data including name and address to prevent individuals from reading these Data as it travels over the Internet. The length of time we retain Personal Data outside our back up system varies depending on the purpose for which it was collected and used. This period may extend beyond the end of the particular relationship with us but only for so long as we are contractually bound to do so, or so far as is necessary for audit or other accounting purposes. When Personal Data are no longer needed we have procedures either to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form. We reserve the right to maintain your Personal Data as part of our standard back up procedures.

We may use third-party services (eg. Zendesk) co-branded as bitaps.com, but will do so with clear notices. Any third-party services may collect information as determined by their own privacy policies.
* We also may use “cookies” from time to time to personalize your online experience with us.
