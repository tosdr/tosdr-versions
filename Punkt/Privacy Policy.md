Communication shall mean the transmission of personal data or the act of making them accessible to third parties.  
Profiling means the automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of such data to evaluate certain personal aspects of a natural person, to analyse or predict aspects of that person's professional performance, economic situation, health, preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, whereabouts and movements.

3. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR for the necessary processing of personal data for the fulfilment of a legal obligation to which we are subject under the applicable law of the member states in the European Economic Area (EEA).

### 11\. Security measures

We protect your personal data with specific technical and organisational security measures, aimed at preventing your personal data from being used illegitimately or fraudulently. In particular, we use security measures that guarantee: the pseudo-anonymisation or the encryption of your data; the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data as well as the resilience of the systems and services that process them; the ability to restore data in the event of a data breach. However, despite these measures, the processing of personal data on the Internet can always have security gaps. We can therefore not guarantee absolute data security. Access to our website is via transfer encryption (SSL/TLS, in particular with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, abbreviated HTTPS). Most browsers mark the transfer encryption with a padlock in the address bar. Access to our website is subject - as it is basically the case for all Internet surfing - to constant and suspicion-free sweeping and other checks by security authorities in Switzerland, the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA) and other countries. We cannot exert any direct influence on the proper handling of personal data by intelligence services, police forces and other security authorities.

### 12\. Complaints

If you believe that the processing of your personal data has been carried out unlawfully, you can lodge a complaint to one of the supervisory authorities responsible for compliance with the rules on personal data protection. The data protection supervisory authority for private data controllers and federal agencies in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). You have the right - if and insofar as the GDPR applies - to lodge a complaint with a competent European data protection supervisory authority.

### 13\. Remote Communication Software

We may use specialised audio and video conferencing services to communicate online. For participation in audio and video conferences, the legal provisions of each individual services, such as data protection policies and conditions of use, also apply. Depending on the situation, we recommend deactivating the microphone by default when participating in audio or video conferences, as well as blurring the background or imposing a virtual background. We use in particular:  
Microsoft Skype: among others; provider: Microsoft; specific information on Skype: 'Microsoft Privacy Statement’
