Legal Notice
============

Valid from 14th November 2023
-----------------------------

### Conditions of use

By accessing this website, as well as any documents, tools and product information contained therein, you declare that you have understood and accepted its conditions of use – these legal statements, together with the general terms & conditions of sale and the privacy policy that are presented separately – in the version that is current at the time of accessing. These conditions of use can be changed at any point; a statement of the date of commencement of validity is displayed at the top of each document.  
Use of this website and its contents, along with these conditions of use themselves, are governed by Swiss law. The exclusive place of jurisdiction is Lugano, Switzerland, unless otherwise required by law.

### Exclusion of liability

All information is provided without obligation; we do not guarantee that each and every part of it is always fully up to date. We reserve the right to amend or update information on this website at any time and without prior notice. This also applies to improvements and/or modifications to the products or software described on this website. This website may contain technical inaccuracies and/or typographical errors.  
Similarly, we accept no liability for technical problems related to the website and its availability (connection difficulties, website availability, etc.), damage caused by third parties, malware of all kinds (viruses, worms, Trojan horses, etc.), and we do not guarantee the perfect functioning of hardware and software while viewing this website.  
Certain links on this website lead to third-party websites. These links are made available for informational purposes only. We have not verified the websites that are linked to and we are not responsible for their content; the use of these links is at your sole risk. We recommend that you read the legal statements and data protection provisions of the respective websites and check how these websites protect your personal data, and also how any third party affiliated to a linked website protects your personal data.  
Under no circumstances will Punkt Tronics AG or its directors, contractors, associates, appointees or other representatives be liable to you or to any third parties for any interruption of operation of your information systems, for the loss of programs or data, or for any other direct, indirect, special or other consequential damage, that result from the use of this or of a linked website. This continues to apply even if specific reference is made to the possibility of such damage.

### Information technology security

Please be aware of the danger arising from viruses or other malicious software (malware) or hacking attacks, phishing and the like. We recommend that you use anti-virus software, anti-spam filters, a firewall and other methods to protect your system and that you take care to keep them up to date. We are excluded from any responsibility for any manipulation made to your computer system by unauthorized persons in relation to access to our website.   Phishing refers to malicious attempts to access confidential data, and it may come in various ways, including email, telephone, SMS text message or fax. Any request to disclose payment card data (e.g. card number, expiry date) or any other sensitive information should be seen as a possible phishing attempt. These requests can often appear extremely realistic. If there are any grounds for doubt, do not respond, do not not click on any link within an email, and do not open any attachments that may be included. Suspicious emails or SMS text messages should be deleted immediately, and excluded/removed from any backups. If you are in doubt about the genuineness of a request for sensitive information, contact us by telephone for confirmation on +41 91 924 9003.

### Data transmission security

Please note that data transmitted via an open network such as the Internet or an email service is visible to anyone. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of messages or documents that are transmitted by these means. Any time that you communicate personal information through an open network, you should be aware that third parties can potentially access this information and use it without your consent. Third parties can therefore detect debit/credit card activity or other business relationships.   Even if the sender and the recipient are located in the same country, the transmission of data via electronic networks will inevitably have security vulnerabilities; also, the transmission may be via other countries, including countries that do not offer the same level of data protection as Switzerland. Your data may be lost, or stolen by unauthorised third parties, during transmission. We will not be liable for the security of your data during electronic transmission and we decline any responsibility for direct or indirect damage. Please use other means of communication if you consider it necessary or reasonable for security reasons.

### Disclaimer

With the revision of the Federal Data Protection Act (FADP), a number of important provisions on the processing of personal data have changed as of September 1st, 2023.  
Our company is extremely careful with the processing and confidentiality of your data, which is why we have promptly adapted to the new legislation which aims to provide greater protection - compared to the previous legislation - for your data.

### Purpose of data processing

Your data are collected to enable the Data Controller to provide its services, as well as for the following purposes: statistics, advertising, contacting you, registration and authentication, heat mapping and session registration, interaction with social networks and external platforms, interaction with contact management and message sending platforms.  
To obtain further detailed information on the purposes of the processing and the Personal Data concretely relevant for each purpose, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.

### Legal basis for processing

The Controller processes your personal data where one of the following conditions exists:

* You have given consent for one or more specific purposes; Note: in some jurisdictions, the Controller may be authorised to process Personal Data without the need for Your consent or another of the legal bases specified below, as long as you don’t object ("opt-out") to such processing. However, this does not apply if the processing of Personal Data is governed by European legislation on the protection of Personal Data;
* processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you and/or the performance of pre-contractual measures;
* processing is necessary for the performance of a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject;
* processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority vested in the Controller;
* processing is necessary for the pursuit of the legitimate interest of the Controller or of third parties.

However, it is always possible to ask the Data Controller to clarify the concrete legal basis of each processing and to specify whether the processing is based on law, required by a contract or necessary to conclude a contract.
