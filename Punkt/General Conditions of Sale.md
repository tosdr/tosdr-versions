Punkt. e-shop - Terms & Conditions of Sale
==========================================

**Valid from the of** **14 November 2023**

Purchases made by individual consumers are covered by consumer protection legislation, which varies between countries. Punkt. encourages customers to find out what protection applies where they live. These terms & conditions in no way limit or replace the applicable consumer protection legislation.  
For information about how we use and protect our customers’ personal information, please see our [**Data Protection Policy**](https://www.punkt.ch/en/data-protection-policy/).

* * *

**1\. The parties**  
These terms and conditions regulate the sale contract between you, the Customer and ourselves, Punkt Tronics AG, the owner of this website.  
Punkt Tronics AG is a limited company incorporated in Switzerland. Our registered headquarters are at Via Losanna 4, 6900 Lugano, and our company registration number is [**CHE-114.634.022**](https://www.uid.admin.ch/Detail.aspx?uid_id=CHE114634022&lang=en)[.](https://www.uid.admin.ch/Detail.aspx?uid_id=CHE114634022&lang=en)

* * *

**2\. Scope of application**  
These terms & conditions regulate all sale contracts entered into between Punkt. and the Customer. Each contract is subject to the terms & conditions that are displayed on our website at the time of purchase. By accessing and using this website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to be bound by the terms of these terms and conditions. You acknowledge that, even if this contract is electronic and not physically signed by you, it should govern your use of the website and terms and conditions of sales. Punkt. will not accept any derogation from these terms and conditions unless expressly agreed by us in writing.

* * *

**3\. Contractual partner, eligible customers**  
The Punkt. e-shop for website purchases is operated by Punkt Tronics AG. Where a purchase contract is entered into via the e-shop, Punkt. will be the Customer's contractual partner.  
The Punkt. e shop is exclusively for purchases made by private consumers. Commercial customers should contact Punkt. via [**this link**](https://www.punkt.ch/en/contact/request-information-or-support/).  
E-shop purchases may only be made by people aged 18 or over. By making a purchase, the Customer declares that he/she is 18 or more years of age.

* * *

**4\. Entering into the contract**  
**(a) General**  
After you place an order with Punkt., acknowledgement of this will be sent by us to the email address you have provided. This acts as confirmation of receipt; it does not constitute a legally binding acceptance of your order. A contract is first created between you and Punkt. when we send you an email saying that the relevant goods have been dispatched to you. This email will include an invoice and a copy of the terms and conditions; if you have a Punkt. account, you can also access the invoice and information about your order by logging in to the Punkt. website.  
If you have not received any acknowledgement of receipt or any other communication from Punkt. within 24 hours of placing an order, please check your spam folder and then contact Punkt. by [**clicking here**](https://www.punkt.ch/en/support/technical-assistance/) to make a support query.  
**(b) Pre-release advance orders**  
Advance orders enable you to secure a place in the queue for a product before it becomes available. When the product is released for sale, stocks are sent to customers who have placed advance orders before the product is made available to other customers.  
Products are generally delivered to us in batches; these batches may be smaller than the total number of customers who have placed advance orders, and there is no guarantee that you will be in the first group of customers to receive an advance-ordered product. If it is not possible to fulfil your order from the first delivery to us, we shall email you with an estimated date of when we expect the next delivery of stock. Advance orders will continue to be accepted until we have received enough stock to be able to fulfil all advance orders; the product will then be placed on general sale.  
If you wish to purchase multiple products, some that are in stock and some that are offered on an advance order basis, we recommend that you order them separately to avoid a delay in the shipment of the in stock products.  
When you place an advance order, you will at that point be charged the full cost of the product(s). If for any reason you decide that you do not wish to continue waiting for the product, you have the right to cancel your order up until the point at which we send you an email informing you that the ordered product is being prepared for dispatch; if you do this, we shall send you a full refund within seven days.  
Although we aim to begin dispatching advance ordered products as soon as possible, you understand and accept that there may be delays. We shall send you periodical updates regarding the anticipated dispatch schedule. Any estimated date of dispatch provided to you is subject to change and is without guarantee. In the event of an estimated release and/or dispatch date not being met, Punkt. is not responsible for any costs that may occur due to this delay, nor shall we be obliged, to provide any discounts, refunds, credits or compensation due to any such delays other than a refund of the amount paid to us by you when you made your pre release advance order.

* * *

**5\. Payment**  
All prices quoted on our website are inclusive of VAT at the current rate.  
The following payment methods are available:  
• credit or debit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners Club, Discover, Maestro, Twint, Union Pay)   
• PayPal  
• Klarna

• Apple Pay (this requires authorisation from your bank)  
• PostFinance  
• bank transfer  
(Payment by credit/debit card is generally the fastest method.)  
Payment is accepted in the following currencies: Swiss francs (CHF), euros (EUR), British pounds (GBP), Norwegian krone (NOK), Swedish krona (SEK), Danish krone (DKK), Japanese Yen (JPY) and American dollars (USD). Currencies are allocated according to shipping destination.  
For payments made by credit card, debit card, Klarna, PostFinance or Apple Pay, the payment process is transferred to the secure servers of the Swiss payment service provider [**Worldline Switzerland Ltd.**](https://www.six-payment-services.com/en/home.html). For payment by PayPal, the process is directed to their secure servers; note that you need to be already registered with them to be able to pay in this way.  
If you choose Klarna as the provider at checkout, we might transfer your personal data in the form of contact and order details to Klarna when the checkout is loaded, in order for Klarna to be able to offer you and tailor for you Klarna’s payment options, to assess whether you qualify for their payment options and manage your purchase. Your personal data transferred is processed in line with [**Klarna’s own privacy notice.**](https://www.klarna.com/international/privacy-policy/)  
If you choose to pay by bank transfer, during checkout you will be provided with instructions on how to do this. An email will be sent to you duplicating these, for your convenience.  
Once your payment is confirmed and the transaction is successful, you will be sent an email acknowledging your order.  
All goods remain the property of Punkt. until full payment is received.  
If payment does not reach us within five calendar days from the point at which your order is initially received by us, an email will be sent to you advising you of this. If payment still has not reached us after an additional 25 days (total 30 days), the order will be cancelled. In this situation there will be no obligations incumbent upon either party.

* * *

**6\. Delivery**  
You are responsible for providing an appropriate delivery address when ordering. We will only be able to amend the delivery address if requested early enough.  
Orders for delivery to addresses in countries belonging to the European Union are provided by Punkt.’s EU representative:  
S.A.T. sas  
F-68870 Bartenheim  
France  
Punkt. arranges deliveries using UPS, DHL, and Swiss Post (who sometimes work with local partners, as appropriate). Standard delivery costs are separately displayed at the time of making the order and are calculated on the basis of the anticipated total weight of the package.   
Standard delivery is free for orders above the minimum order value established by the selected shipping country.

Orders are usually dispatched within two working days, subject to stock availability. (Please note that we dispatch from a number of different countries, depending on destination, and these countries have different public holidays.) Dispatch may take a little longer at peak times, e.g. at Christmas, after new product launches and during promotional campaigns. Our e- shop will not normally accept an order for a product that is not in stock, but exceptions to this can occasionally occur. If this happens, we shall inform you of when the product is likely to be back in stock; you can then decide whether to wait, request an alternative product or receive a refund.  
At the e- shop checkout stage, an estimated delivery time is shown for the selected country. Standard delivery usually takes 1- 2 working days in Switzerland and 2-5 working days in the European Union, the UK, EFTA and USA (remote areas can take longer). Standard delivery to the rest of the world usually takes 5-10 working days. We offer an express delivery option to the following destinations: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands. Express delivery usually takes 1-2 working days.  
Please note that estimated delivery times start from the date of dispatch and are indicative only. We are not responsible for shipping delays caused by the actions of customs officials or couriers/local postal services.

* * *

**7\. Customer's right of withdrawal (‘Returns’)**  
(a) Changing your mind  
If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with your purchase from Punkt., you are entitled to withdraw from the contract within 30 days from receipt of the shipment, return the purchased product and receive a refund (including delivery cost). This period of 30 days commences from the day after receipt of the purchased goods (reliance will be made upon the delivery date stated by the courier).  
For customers who purchased a MC02, this includes a 1-year subscription to Apostrophy Services. If you are returning your MC02 within the initial period of 30 days, please check how to cancel the subscription to Apostrophy Services [**here**](https://aphy.app/tos).  
When purchasing a product, you agree to exercise this right in accordance with the procedure described in Section 10 below, which describes how to return a product. In particular, it is essential that you liaise with Punkt. before returning something to us, to ensure that a) it is shipped efficiently, b) it is sent to the appropriate destination, and c) it does not incur unnecessary taxes and customs duties. Products that are returned to us without liaising with us first almost always arrive with extra charges due; if you return a product without following the procedure specified by us, you undertake to reimburse us for these charges.

Once a product’s return has been authorised by Punkt., the product must be received at the address specified by us within 14 working days of the date that the authorisation was sent.  
Assuming everything is in order, we shall make the refund within 30 days from the date at which we first authorised the return. In order for us to comply with money laundering legislation, we are obliged to make refunds exclusively to the same payment method used for the original purchase. For payments with credit cards, if the credit card is no longer valid, the cardholder must contact the issuing bank and request a chargeback. The bank will then return the original transaction to us through the service provider.  
When using Klarna payment, you are required to fulfill all payment duties as outlined in their terms, **regardless of any ongoing return requests**. If you do not meet these obligations, you will automatically be considered in default without additional reminders. As a result, you will have to pay a default interest rate of 8% and a possible reminder charge of up to CHF 30.00. Additionally, you might incur other charges, particularly for expenses related to potential debt collection activities. As soon as the refund is due we will refund you the full amount you paid.  
We hold no responsibility for any interest or fees imposed by Klarna if you fail to fulfill their payment obligations.  
The right of withdrawal from the contract is in all cases subject to the following conditions, in addition to those laid out in Section 10. In summary, your right to withdraw from the contract is designed to replicate the process of examining a product in a physical shop.  
• The product (brand new or refurbished) must be returned in the condition that it was received, and complete with any documentation, instructions and accessories that it came with. Any tags, labels or screen protector films that were attached to it when it was supplied must not have been removed.  
• The product must be returned in its original packaging, which must also be in the same condition as it was received and be complete with all its elements. As a sole exception, if it is genuinely impossible to remove a product from its branded packaging without damaging the latter, this necessary damage to the packaging is acceptable. Do not write on the branded packaging, or attach labels or sticky tape to it.  
• You are responsible for ensuring that the product and its branded packaging is adequately prepared for shipping. This means that it must be placed in crush resistant outer packaging, i.e. a strong cardboard box with appropriate filler material within it. We strongly recommend that you retain the outer packaging it was delivered in for this purpose, at least for the duration of the 30-day trial period.  
• The right of withdrawal applies only to the purchased product in its entirety; no withdrawal will be accepted for only part of the purchased product (other products ordered at the same time are not affected).  
• **If you do not comply with these requirements, your right to receive a refund in exchange for returning the product is forfeited.**  
• Any request to withdraw from the Contract received after 30 days will be rejected and will not qualify for a refund.  
(b) Products discovered to be defective on arrival  
If a product appears to be defective on arrival, please contact our Customer Service department exclusively via [**the Support section**](https://www.punkt.ch/en/support/technical-assistance/) of our website. They may be able to remedy the situation by providing you with additional information. Beyond that, you have the right to return the product within 30 days of receipt, under the same conditions described in Section 7A (e.g. the product and branded packaging must be complete and undamaged), and receive your choice of a replacement or a full refund. We reserve the right to examine the product when we receive it in order to confirm that the fault is not caused by damage incurred after you received the product, and undertake to do this promptly.  
See also the warranty terms in Section 9 below, which applies to products once they have been in the customer’s possession for more than 30 days.

* * *

**8\. Exchanges**  
If you decide that you would rather have a different product, please contact our Customer Service department exclusively via [**the Support section**](https://www.punkt.ch/en/support/technical-assistance/) of our website, as soon as possible. If you let us know in time, we may be able to prevent the currently ordered product from being dispatched and send the different product instead; this will be the quickest solution.  
If you are not able to contact us in time, please refuse the delivery and immediately inform us that you have done this. The courier will return the package to us and we shall arrange to send you your preferred product.  
If you only decide that you would like a different product once you have examined the product initially ordered, you may return it to us within 30 days in accordance with the conditions described above. Tell us what you would like instead and we shall send it to you instead of arranging a refund. You will not have to pay extra delivery costs.

* * *

**9\. Warranty terms**  
a) Duration  
All new products purchased from authorised dealers or via the Punkt. website come with a two-year Punkt. guarantee. The warranty on units sold as “refurbished” is limited to a period of one year.

In the event of a product being repaired or replaced by Punkt. under warranty, the warranty period is extended to match the length of time that it takes for the issue to be resolved.  
In cases where a product has been repaired by or on behalf of Punkt. other than under warranty (e.g. accidental damage or when the warranty has expired), the repair work comes with a six month warranty. If the product is still within the warranty from its purchase, this is unaffected.  
All warranty periods commence from the date upon which the Customer receives the product. In determining this date, reliance will be made upon the delivery date stated by the courier.

b) Limitation of cover  
The warranty will be voided by any inappropriate use, and/or any modification, manipulation or repair other than those carried out by or expressly authorised by Punkt. The warranty only covers problems caused by manufacturing defects; it does not apply to problems caused by other factors such as misuse, accidental damage (e.g. dropping the product or allowing water ingress beyond its stated water-resistance capacity), inappropriate electrical supply, extreme environmental conditions (e.g. humidity, high temperatures), or any other use that is not in accordance with the product’s instruction manual and associated literature).  
The warranty shall not apply to or extend to software or services provided with the product.  
The warranty does not cover disposable batteries and devices fitted with accessories not authorised by Punkt.  
Please note that we are not liable for any damage incurred while a product is being returned to us;

c) Claims  
If you need to make a warranty claim, please make a support request on the Support section of our website [**here**](https://www.punkt.ch/en/support/technical-assistance/). Using other forms of communication will mean that it takes us longer to deal with your claim. You will be asked to provide, among other information, the original order number (if the product was purchased directly from us) or proof of purchase (if it was bought elsewhere), the serial number of the product and a detailed description of the problem. The serial number can be found on the product’s original packaging. Our Customer Service team will then normally contact you within three working days. (It may take a little longer at peak times, e.g. at Christmas, after new product launches and during promotional campaigns.)  
Important: Please do not return any product under warranty until you have been requested to do so by Punkt. Doing so will cause delays in processing your claim. The parcel is likely to arrive with unnecessary taxes and/or import duty to pay; if you return a product without following the procedure specified by us, you undertake to reimburse us for these charges. We shall send you an address label that will prevent these charges from being applied.  
If you have contacted us before the expiry date of the warranty period, and it is reasonable to say that the product has a manufacturing defect, we shall repair or replace it (at our choice) free of charge. If the claim is made within six months of initial receipt of the product, it will be assumed that a problem is the result of a manufacturing defect unless the contrary can be demonstrated; after six months it will be necessary to demonstrate that a problem is caused by a manufacturing defect.  
The only situation in which we shall make a refund of the cost of a defective product is if you make a support request within 30 days from initial receipt of the goods, as described in Section 7 above.  
This warranty does not cover any other claims arising from or related to the product. It is important to note that this warranty does not seek to restrict or eliminate the Customer's statutory rights, nor does it affect Punkt's responsibility in cases of death or personal injury caused by its negligence.

d) Third party warranty  
The product may grant access to certain content and services that belong to third parties and are safeguarded by intellectual property laws, including copyrights, patents, and trademarks. It is essential to respect the authorization of the content owner or service provider when using such content or services. To clarify, unless explicitly permitted by the content owner or service provider, you are prohibited from engaging in activities such as altering, reproducing, sharing, uploading, publishing, transmitting, translating, selling, creating derivative works from, or distributing the content or services displayed on the product, regardless of the format or medium.

* * *

**10\. Return policy**  
If you need to return a product to us, whether under your right of withdrawal from the purchase contract  or as part of a claim under warranty, please follow these instructions carefully in order to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and expense. The system described below ensures that a) the goods are sent to the correct location; b) they are conveyed in the most efficient way; and c) we are able to process them much more quickly once they reach us.

• Contact us before dispatching the product. Do this by accessing your account on punkt.ch (or by creating a new account, if this was not done at the time of purchase) and opening a support request in the [**Support section**](https://www.punkt.ch/en/support/technical-assistance/) of the website. You will be asked to provide, among other information, the order number, the serial number of the product and a detailed description of the reason for the return. Assuming everything is in order, we shall then provide you with a Return Merchandise Authorisation (RMA) number. Please do not return a product without prior approval from us.  
• Use the prepaid label enclosed with the product, and its associated courier, unless we ask you to do otherwise. This will ensure that the parcel goes to the correct distribution center, is conveyed in the most cost-effective manner, and avoids unnecessary customs duties and taxes. Write the RMA number clearly on a piece of paper and include it inside the parcel. If you no longer have the prepaid return label please contact us and we shall issue you with a replacement.  
• Ensure that the product is adequately packed. You are liable for any damage in transit that can be shown to be due to inadequate packing. Please retain the original packaging for this purpose.  
• Remember to enclose all accessories. If you are returning the product because you wish to withdraw from the purchase, remember that it needs to be returned in a saleable condition; we reserve the right to reduce or cancel your refund if it is damaged and/or accessories are missing.  
• If you’re returning your MC02 and you are eligible to a full refund, make sure to also check [How to cancel the subscription](https://support.remarkable.com/s/article/How-to-cancel-your-subscription) to Apostrophy Services **[here](https://aphy.app/tos)**.

If a product is sent to us without following these instructions, it will almost certainly arrive with substantial import duty/tax to pay. If you do return a product without following the procedure specified by us, you undertake to reimburse us for these charges. Also, the unlikely event that the parcel arrives at the correct site and without import duty/tax payable, we shall only be able to refund your shipping costs up to what we would have paid our own courier; because we have a wholesale contract with them, this will be considerably less than a one-off arrangement that you are likely to make.

* * *

**11\. Repair policy**  
• Contact us before dispatching the product. Do this by accessing your account on punkt.ch (or by creating a new account, if this was not done at the time of purchase) and opening a support request in the [Support section](https://www.punkt.ch/en/support/technical-assistance-and-faq/)  of the website. You will be asked to provide, among other information, the order number, the serial number of the product and a detailed description of the reason for the return. Assuming everything is in order, we shall then provide you with a Return Merchandise Authorisation (RMA) number and the instructions to send the product to our authorised repair center. Please do not send a product without prior approval from us.  
• Repairs covered under warranty are provided at no additional cost, and we will cover shipping.

• Out-of-warranty repairs authorised by Punkt via RMA number will be charged with a repair fee, varying based on the nature and the complexity of the repair. In the event of a product being repaired under warranty, the warranty period is extended to match the length of time that it takes for the issue to be resolved. In cases where a product has been repaired by or on behalf of Punkt. other than under warranty (e.g. accidental damage or when the warranty has expired), the repair work comes with a six month warranty.  
• You will be provided with the repair fee before any work is initiated.  
• We aim to complete repairs within 5 business days upon receipt of the product, subject to availability of parts.  
• You are responsible for the repair fee and shipping costs to the repair center for out-of-warranty repairs.  
• You are encouraged to back up all data of your product before submitting for repair as we are not responsible for any data loss. Please ensure all passwords and other security measures are disabled 

* * *

**12\. Links to Other Resources**  
Although the website may contain links to other resources (such as websites, mobile applications, etc.), we do not directly or indirectly imply endorsement, association, sponsorship, approval or affiliation with any linked resource, unless expressly stated herein. Some of the links on the website may be "affiliate links". This means that if you click on the link and purchase an item, Punkt will receive an affiliate commission. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating and do not guarantee the offers of companies or individuals or the content of their resources. We take no responsibility for the actions, products, services, and content of third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other terms of use of any resource you access via a link on the website. Linking to any other resource outside the website is at your own risk.

* * *

**13\. Data protection**  
We encourage you to read our [**Data Protection Policy**](https://www.punkt.ch/en//en/data-protection-policy/), which includes use of the Punkt. e-shop. It provides information about how and for what purposes we collect and use your personal data.

* * *

**14\. Limitation of liability**  
Under no circumstances will Punkt. be liable for any incidental, special or consequential loss arising out or related to this agreement. In the event of Punkt. being held liable for any loss related to this agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy will be the full refund of your purchase price without interest.

* * *

**15\. Governing law and jurisdiction**  
The contract between the Customer and Punkt. is made exclusively under Swiss law, and in the event of disputes, Swiss laws will be applicable.  
Any dispute, deriving from or in any way related to these terms and conditions will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Lugano, Switzerland.

* * *

**16\. Force majeure**  
Punkt. is exempt from all liability for the total or partial non-fulfilment of any contractual obligations where that non-fulfilment is caused by unforeseeable events beyond the control and responsibility of Punkt. including, by way of example but without limitation, natural events, pandemics, epidemics, acts of terrorism, wars, civil uprisings, malfunctioning of connectivity, electricity shortages, general strikes by public and/or private workers, strikes and/or restrictions on road access by/for couriers, and air connections.

* * *

**17\. Miscellaneous**  
If any one of these general terms and conditions proves to be invalid or becomes invalid at a later date, this will not affect the validity of the rest of the contract. In such a case, the invalid term will be replaced with a term that represents as closely as possible its intention and financial purpose and/or with the appropriate legal provisions. Therefore, the parties agree and accept that the invalidity of a term and/or condition is not grounds for cancelling or invalidating the agreement as they declare that this is without prejudice to good faith in the implementation of the contract and the fact that the parties could not reasonably anticipate that invalidity at the time of entering into the agreement. Punkt. reserves the right to amend these general terms and conditions at any time. Such amendments will be published as a replacement for or an addition to the terms & conditions existing up to that time.  
We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you provide to us.  
Your continued use of the website after the effective date of the revised terms and conditions (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to such changes.  
In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between the English version and any other language versions of these terms and conditions, the English language version shall prevail.  
You acknowledge that you have read these terms and conditions and that you accept all its terms. By accessing and using the website you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.  
If you have any questions, concerns or complaints regarding these terms and conditions, please contact us writing an e-mail to: [info@punkt.ch](mailto:info@punkt.ch).
