6\. International Transfers of Personal Information
---------------------------------------------------

We do not share Your personal information with third parties, unless it is necessary to carry out Your request, for our legitimate business needs, or as required or permitted by applicable law. Where we do transfer Your personal information to third parties or service providers, appropriate arrangements will be made in order to ensure correct and secure data processing in compliance with applicable data protection law.

We store personal information about  Website visitors and Attendees within the United States and in other countries and territories to facilitate our global operations. Our Content Delivery Network (CDN) runs on IBM Softlayer and Google Cloud Platform; and the servers are spread across 10 locations — Japan, Australia, Singapore, Netherlands, London, Paris, France, Germany and 3 cities in the US to help serve a dynamic request for tests. However, all the Customer Account Data is stored centrally in Washington DC and  Dallas, United States. We may update our data center geography and server locations based on customer requirements or to meet security, compliance and legal requirements. Your personal information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than the country in which You are a resident. Therefore, Your personal information may be processed outside of the EEA and in countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide for the same level of data protection as the EEA.

In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of Your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR), or we will ask You for Your prior consent to such international data transfers. We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where Your personal information is transferred to countries outside the EEA, such as:

1. the recipient country has an adequacy decision from the European Commission.
2. the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal information.

Refer below table as our **adequacy safeguards** details.
