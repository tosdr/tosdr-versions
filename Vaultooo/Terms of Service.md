Terms of Service
----------------

#### Introduction

The Services are provided by the entity specified in Section 14 of these General Terms (“we,” “us,” “our,”, “Vault.ooo” or “Vault”, ). Please note that the Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Vault.ooo. By visiting our websites or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read the Terms, understand them, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and acknowledging that you have the authority to act on behalf of that organization and commit to these Terms on behalf of that organization. If you do not agree with these Terms or any provisions hereof, please do not install and do not use our Services.

#### Updates to Terms

Vault may modify the Terms from time to time. The most recent version is the version that applies to your use of the Services. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the website or via email. Unless it is stated by us otherwise, each update of the Terms comes into force as of the moment when amended Terms are published on this web page. You understand and agree that any continued use and access to the Services after any updates to these Terms are published, means that you voluntarily agree to be bound by the updated Terms.

#### Privacy

For information about how we process information about you and your use of our Services, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://vault-m0h1.pages.dev/privacy) .

#### Risk

Your use of the Services is at your own risk. The Services may be modified, updated, interrupted or suspended at any time without notice or liability. We do not bear any liability for any harm or other adverse consequences to you, caused by this. Vault, its owners, employees, agents and others that are involved with the Services are not in any way or form liable for any harm of any kind executed or intended, resulting from or arising through or from the use of any account registered with Services.

#### Payments and Refund

All our paid Services are subscribed on a service period basis. You choose the service period and the payment method yourself when you sign up for the paid Services. We determine your free trial eligibility at our sole discretion, and to the extent permitted under applicable law we may limit or withdraw a free trial option at any time without prior notice. You acknowledge and agree that we will automatically charge you for our paid Services at the end of the free trial period on a recurring basis. If you do not want to be charged, you must cancel the paid subscription before the end of the free trial by contacting our support team. If you received a free trial from a third party, you may also cancel the paid subscription through that third party.  
If you wish to claim a refund, you can do so within 14 days following your purchase of our Services if you have not uploaded a single file. We seek your full satisfaction with our Services. However, we would like to troubleshoot an issue you experience first. There are common service configuration issues that may hinder the Services for you, and we resolve most user issues encountered.  
You can only get a refund for our Services twice. If you buy any of our Services again after that, you will not be granted a refund for any further cancellation. We do not grant refunds for recurring subscription payments if you cancel the Services after the renewal, unless applicable law provides otherwise. No refunds will be considered for accounts terminated for violation of these Terms. Once the refund is issued to you, you will lose access to the Services.

#### Minors

The Services are not directed to minors, and any use by minors should only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents or guardians. Further, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Services if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

#### Prohibited and restricted uses

Your access to and use of the Services is subject to these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. We reserve the right, at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice, to delete files, to terminate the accounts of, and block access to the Services to any users who infringe any applicable laws or these Terms.  
You agree that you shall not:  

* use, assist, encourage, or enable others to use the Services for any unlawful, illicit, illegal, criminal or fraudulent activities;
* violate, infringe, or misappropriate other people's intellectual property, privacy or other legal rights;
* share anything that is illegal, abusive, harassing, or otherwise objectionable;
* transmit any viruses or other computer instructions or technological means that disrupt, damage, or interfere with the use of computers or related systems;
* take any action that imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
* attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services, user accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Services through hacking, password mining, brute force or any other means;
* violate general ethic or moral norms, good customs and fair conduct norms;
* use the Services for anything other than lawful purposes;
* to otherwise infringe or circumvent these Terms.

We reserve the right to refuse service, suspend accounts or limit access to the Services such as file access in our sole discretion. Such suspension or access limitation may be implemented by Vault.ooo instantly and without any indication, notice or refund.  
You are disallowed to connect and use the Services if you are a minor, a competitor of our business, if you have been or are prohibited to access the Services, or if your account has been suspended or closed due to any reason.  

#### Warranties

Reasonable efforts are taken to improve the accuracy and integrity of the Services, but complex software is never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs. We give no warranty or representation that the Services will be wholly free from defects, errors and bugs, such as downtime, loss of data, corrupt data, service delay, mistakes, out-of-date information, or other. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, we reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to the Services, or any functionality comprising a part of the Services at any time without notice. In no event will we be liable for making these changes. As a registered user in good standing, you may be provided with limited service by Vault. We do not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for your use of the Services or other products or services we provide. We may also impose limits on the use of or access to the Services, for any reason and without notice or liability. Our Services may be unavailable from time to time due to human, digital, mechanical, telecommunication, software, and other failures. We cannot predict or control when such downtime may occur and cannot control the duration of such downtime.

#### Premium

The "Premium" product is not directly related to Vault.ooo. After purchase, you will receive a link to create a shared Google Drive repository, to which only the buyer is added as a member with the email address he provided. Further details can be found in the product description. Google is solely responsible for availability, data security and the entire product. Files uploaded to Google Drive are not encrypted. Vault.ooo has no control over any changes that may be unwanted by you. We are not obligated to any refund if Google decides to discontinue or limit the service.

#### Electronic communications

You agree to receive communications from us electronically, e.g., by email, application messages, etc. and consent that such notifications satisfy any legal requirement for communication in writing. You agree that we may communicate to you for the purpose of advising you of changes or additions to the Services, about any of our products or services, or for such other purposes that are reasonable or required by applicable law.  
When communicating with our customer support representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. If we feel that your behavior towards any of our customer support representatives or other employees is at any time threatening or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.

#### Miscellaneous

We reserve the right to modify and update these Terms at our sole discretion, at any time, for any reason, and without liability.  
We also reserve the right to modify or update the operation of the Services at our sole discretion, at any time, for any reason, and without notice or liability. We may even suspend the Services entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.  
The Terms constitute an agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. The parties acknowledge that no reliance is placed on any representation made but not expressly contained in these Terms.  
If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  
These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the substantive laws of Germany, without regard to its choice of law provisions. You agree that the courts of general jurisdiction located in Germany will have exclusive jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Services.  
For all purposes, the English language version of the Terms shall be the original, governing instrument and understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between this English language version of the Terms and any subsequent translation into any other language, the English language version shall govern and control.
