DDoS Protection Service Disclaimer (The Reality Check):

While we pledge to our clients that we will do everything possible to protect their Internet resources from DDoS attacks, we must remind them that the world we are all live in has only a handful of things that are truly unlimited. The world of Internet has known DDoS attacks capable of putting down websites of the biggest corporations and even cutting off entire countries. For this reason, on expectedly very rear occasions, due to extreme intensities of some DDoS attacks, we may not even get a chance to apply our DDoS filtering solutions because of the upstream network providers' rulings. This, in turn, may result in continentally partial accessibility of our customer websites, or even their complete shut off for independent from us reasons.
