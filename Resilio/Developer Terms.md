-------------------------------

#### **Last updated June 1, 2016.  
**

BY CLICKING ON THE **“SUBMIT”** OR **“AGREE"** OR **"ACCEPT"** BUTTON OR BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. If you agree to this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to this Agreement. In such event, **“you”** will refer to that company or other legal entity.  
  
Thank you for your interest in the Resilio Sync™ API. **"API"** means the Resilio Sync™ API, accompanying documentation, sample code and related materials, including any updates that we may provide to you from time to time. The API is designed to provide developers with software and reference information that allow independent third party developers to develop apps that include technologies, including reference programs and programming interface information to link into and extend the features of Resilio Sync (**“API Information”**) in your applications (an **"Application"**). The evaluation version of the API (“Evaluation API”) may be used by licensee only for internal evaluation purposes, as set forth herein, and may not be distributed. The API and Resilio Sync sometimes referred to as the **"Service"**.  
  
**Use of the API is Subject to these Terms.**  
Your use of the API is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Resilio, Inc. (**“Resilio”**), whose principal place of business is at 4900 Hopyard Road, STE 100, Pleasanton, CA 94588, United States. This legal agreement is referred to as the **"Terms"**.  
  
Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Resilio, the Terms will include the following:  
(i) the terms and conditions set forth in this document; and  
(ii) Resilio's [Privacy Policy](https://www.resilio.com/legal/privacy/).(a) Before you use the API, you should read each of the documents comprising the Terms, and print or save a local copy for your records.  
  
Resilio reserves the right to make changes to the Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, Resilio will make a new copy of the Terms available at [https:/www.resilio.com/legal/terms-sync-api/](https://www.resilio.com/legal/terms-sync-api/) . You understand and agree that if you use the API or the Service after the date on which the Terms have changed, Resilio will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms. If a modification is unacceptable to you, you may terminate the agreement by ceasing use of the API.  
  
**Using the API.**  
You must agree to the Terms. You accept the Terms by using the API. In this case, you understand and agree that Resilio will treat your use of the API as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms. If you don't have the legal authority to bind, please ensure that an authorized person from your entity consents to and accepts these Terms.
