#### **1\. License**

The software (including all its accompanying features and services), the Sync Licensed API Key and/or any software documentation (the “Documentation”) that accompanies this License Agreement (collectively the “Software”) is the property of Resilio or its licensors, and is protected by copyright law. The Software is licensed, not sold. Although Resilio continues to own the Software, after Your acceptance of this License Agreement, You will have certain rights to use the Software during the Service Period under the terms of this License Agreement. The **“Service Period”** shall begin on the date that the license key is delivered to You, in the case of Software licenses purchase directly from Resilio, or to a Reseller (defined below), in the case of Software licenses purchased from a Reseller, and shall last during the term of such license for which You have fully paid the fees, subject to the terms of this License Agreement. The Software may automatically deactivate and become non-operational at the end of the Service Period.  
‍  
This License Agreement governs any releases, revisions, updates or enhancements to the Software that Resilio may make available to You. Except as may be modified by the Documentation, and subject to Resilio’s right to terminate for Your breach pursuant to Section 10, Your rights and obligations under this License Agreement with respect to the use of this Software are as follows.

During the Service Period, Your subscription is personal and shall cover the devices that are permitted to link under Your same unique user identity managed through “My Devices” within Your settings in the Software. Each unique user and unique user identity requires its own subscription to the Software. For purposes of clarity, a user identity is personal to one individual user (an entity is not considered an individual user but each person within such entity using the Software is considered an individual user) and may not be shared with other users except Sync Pro Family, which can be shared with a total of 4 Family members besides the Purchaser.

If you purchase a service from a Resilio-authorized service provider (a “Service Provider”) that includes Software, such Service Provider is solely responsible for any obligations to You.  Resellers and Service Providers are not authorized to make any promises or commitments on Resilio’s behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than what we specify in this Agreement.
