#### **Date of last revision: June 30, 2022**

At Resilio we take your privacy very seriously. We fully appreciate and respect the importance of data privacy and security on the Internet.  

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of text stored on your computer when you visit a website. They are not programs and cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses – instead, cookies act more like a passport, which the site checks and updates whenever you visit. Most websites which you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience. Their functions include verifying your identity for security purposes; determining the type of browser and settings you are using or allowing site owners and third-party advertisers to tailor content to your preferences. Cookies are managed by your browser. Each cookie is unique and contains some anonymous information such as a unique identifier, site name, digits and letters. It allows a website to remember your browsing preferences.  
  
Through cookies we place on your browser or End-Device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  

### Types of cookies

Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. The website uses both persistent and session cookies.  

#### **Session cookies**

A session cookie is essential to ensure the correct functioning of the website and is used to manage registration/login and access to reserved features. Session cookies are stored temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from the user’s device when the browser is closed.  

#### **Persistent cookies**

Persistent cookies are saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and are not deleted when the browser is closed (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date).  

#### **First party cookies**

Cookies set by the website owner or service provider (Resilio) are called “first party cookies” and they can only be read by that site. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies.”  

#### **Third party cookies**

Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.  

In addition, we use “Google Analytics” to analyse the use of our website. “Google Analytics” generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies on users’ computers. The information generated in relation to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. “Google” will store this information. You can disable Google Analytics cookies by visiting the following address: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB). “Google’s privacy policy” is available at: [http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)  

### Changing Cookies Settings

You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use Resilio services though your access to some functionality and areas may be restricted. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use Resilio services. You can also delete cookies already stored on your computer. Again, doing this may have a negative impact on the usability of our services.  
  
As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information. It is necessary to follow the instructions provided by the web browser, which are usually located within the ‘Help’, ‘Tools’ or ‘Edit’ menus.  
  
Alternatively, an external resource is available at [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies), providing specific information about cookies and how to manage them to suit the user’s preferences.
