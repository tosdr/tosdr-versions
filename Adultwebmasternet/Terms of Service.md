    * **2.2.** Before you can use the Web Application, Client will need to create an account through the registration form available on the Website. Client can add Content Previews by entering feed(s) into the application. That way PB Web Media can send traffic to Client’s content.
    * **2.3.** The Client is responsible for ensuring that login details are treated confidentially. All actions that are carried out via an account will be at the Client’s expense and risk. PB Web Media may assume that these actions have been carried out by the Client itself or with the Client’s consent.

    * **2.4.** The rights provided under this Clause 2 are granted to Client only and shall not be considered granted to any subsidiary or holding company of Client, unless expressly agreed otherwise.
* ### ARTICLE 3. LICENSE GRANT

    * **4.3.** Client shall:

    * **4.6.** PB Web Media monitors content that Clients and/or Users enter into the Web Application, by both automated and manual checks. Before content is placed, the entered username and certain textual metadata are checked automatically whether they contain a previously banned username of a specific site or terms that are on PB Web Media’s [banned terms list](https://my.tubetraffic.com/banned-terms) (e.g. “drunk”). In addition, thumbnail hashes are created and checked against certain previously blocked hashes based on laws and regulations, and our [Acceptable Content Policy](https://tubetraffic.com/acceptable-content-policy/). In doing so, PB Web Media also uses the API Instant Image Identifier of Offlimits Expertise Centre on Online Abuse which checks all available hashlists for known CSAM.
    * **4.7.** In addition to these technical tools, PB Web Media manually monitors and removes content that violates this ToU, the [Acceptable Content Policy](https://tubetraffic.com/acceptable-content-policy/) and applicable laws. For more insight on how PB Web Media moderates content, see our Transparency Report on the corresponding website.
    * **4.8.** If Client and/or authorized Users violate these ToU, the Acceptable Content Policy or applicable laws, or receives a compliant or notice about this, PB Web Media reserves the right (but has no obligation thereto), without liability or prejudice to its other rights to Client, to:
        * remove or disable access to the content;
        * suspend or terminate the provision of the Traffic Services, in whole or in part;
        * suspend or terminate Client’s and/or the authorized User’s access to the Web Application; or
        * suspend, terminate or otherwise restrict the ability to monetize content provided by Client.
    * **4.9.** PB Web Media shall notify Client about the decision mentioned in the previous paragraph by e-mail or via the Web Application, by including a clear and specific justification for the decision made.

For more information on the procedure of removing content, see our [Notice and Action Policy](https://tubetraffic.com/notice-and-action-policy/).
    * **4.10.** If in the opinion of PB Web Media the continued functioning of the computer systems or network of PB Web Media or third parties is actually or under threat of being damaged or jeopardized, for example through excessive transmission of e-mail or other data, leaks of personal data or virus activity, PB Web Media may take all steps it deems reasonably necessary to end or avert such damage or jeopardy.
    * **4.11.** PB Web Media is at all times entitled to file a criminal complaint for any offenses committed through or using the Web Application. In addition, PB Web Media is entitled to supply the name, address, IP-address and other identifying data to a third party alleging that the Client and/or Users violate its rights, provided the applicable legal and/or judicial requirements for this have been met.
    * **4.12.** PB Web Media may recoup from Client all damages it suffers as a result of Client’s violation of these ToU. Client agrees and holds PB Web Media harmless from all third-party claims arising out of Client’s violation of these ToU.
* ### ARTICLE 5. REPEAT INFRINGEMENT POLICY
    
    * **5.1.** If Client frequently shares manifestly illegal Content Previews through PB Web Media’s Traffic Service, PB Web Media has the right to suspend Client from PB Web Media’s Traffic Service.
    * **5.2.** PB Web Media will notify Client when it becomes aware of a manifestly illegal Content Preview shared by Client through PB Web Media’s Traffic Service. After the notification, Client has two weeks to detest PB Web Media’s assessment by providing proof the Content Preview isn’t manifestly illegal. If Client does not detest PB Web Media’s assessment or fails, in PB Web Media’s discretion, to provide convincing evidence PB Web Media’s assessment is false, the Content Preview will be deemed manifestly illegal.
    * **5.3.** Among others, the following criteria will be taken into account when assessing whether Client frequently shares manifestly illegal Content Previews:
        * the severity of the illegal Content Preview. Sharing CSAM and/or CSEM is weighed more heavily than, for example, a Content Preview that infringes someone’s intellectual property right(s);
        * the number of manifestly illegal Content Previews shared (in relation to the total number of shared Content Previews) within a given time frame;
        * whether Client with regard to the Content Preview(s) falls under the definition of ‘online platform’ as described in Article 3 (i) of REGULATION (EU) 2022/2065;
        * whether Client intents to take effective measures.
    * **5.4.** If Client does not fall under the definition of ‘online platform’ as described in Article 3 (i) of REGULATION (EU) 2022/2065 and manifestly shares CSAM and/or CSEM through PB Web Media’s Traffic Service, Client will be suspended immediately without further prior warning.
    * **5.5.** Through a written and reasoned notice PB Web Media will notify Client about a (temporarily) suspension. Depending on the number of times Client has been suspended, the duration of the suspension is as follows:
        * suspended for 1 month or until Client has taken effective measures;
        * suspended for 3 months or until Client has taken effective measures;
        * suspended for 1 year or until Client has taken effective measures.
    
    * ### ARTICLE 6. RANKING
        
        * **6.1.** The Content Previews that are shown on PB Web Media’s sites, are ranked and made searchable to optimize the likelihood that visitors will discover content that they wish to see.
        * **6.2.** The ranking of Content Previews on PB Web Media’s sites is based on several factors. The factors that will usually affect the ranking the most are:
            * a bidding system: where Clients have the flexibility to determine the rates for Traffic Services. Opting for a higher rate (or lower rate) can impact the ranking of the Content Previews;
            * quality of Content Previews: higher quality makes it more likely to receive more clicks from visitors, thus making the Content Preview more popular and rank higher.
        * **6.3.** Other factors that affect the ranking relatively less include among others:
            * rating: visitors can influence the ranking by rating the content, such as giving certain content a negative rating or by providing feedback.
            * the IP address of the visitor: for example, the list of categories is optimized depending on the IP address from which the visitor requests access to any of PB Web Media’s sites. This IP address can belong to a block that is related to the country the visitor resides in, or to a block that is used by a VPN service that facilitates a more anonymous experience for the visitor;
            * the browser language: for example, the list of categories is optimized based on the language the visitor has set in their browser.
            * orientation setting: if the visitor can set the orientation option to certain presets such as gay, transgender, and/or straight, this influences for example the list of categories.
        * **6.4.** It is the combination of the above and other factors that determines the ranking. Therefore, the ranking may differ per visitor, whereas PB Web Media makes no distinction in this regard. In addition, all Content Previews are accessible to all visitors via the search feature on PB Web Media’s sites.
    * ### ARTICLE 7. AVAILABILITY AND MAINTENANCE
        
        * **7.1.** PB Web Media makes no promises regarding availability of the Web Application.

        * **7.3.** PB Web Media may from time to time add or change functionalities of the Web Application. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome but ultimately PB Web Media decides which functionality will be added or changed.
        * **7.4.** If in PB Web Media’s opinion nuisance, damage or other danger arises for the systems or network of PB Web Media or third parties, for example as a result of a (d)dos attack or security breach, PB Web Media is entitled to take all measures necessary to avert this damage or danger. This may result in temporary unavailability of the Web Application.

        * **8.3.** Client can terminate the license of the previous clause by removing the information in question and/or to terminate Client’s account.
        * **8.4.** Client may change or remove information published or stored using the Web Application at Client’s own discretion.
        * **8.5.** If Client sends information to PB Web Media, for example a bug report or suggestion for improvement, you grant PB Web Media a perpetual and unlimited license to use this information for improving the services. This does not apply to information Client expressly marks as confidential.
    * ### ARTICLE 9. USE, ACCESS AND VISIT OF THE WEBSITE AND WEB APPLICATION
