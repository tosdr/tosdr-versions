1\. Acceptance of Terms of Use.
-------------------------------

**BY ACCESSING AND USING THE PROPERTIES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.** If you do not agree to be bound by these terms of use, you may not access or use the Properties. These Terms of Use may be prospectively changed, modified, or altered by us in our sole discretion at any time without prior notice. If we materially change the Terms of Use, we will notify you through a notice, updated Terms of Use on the Properties or by email (sent to the email address specified in your account, if any), prior to or upon the change(s) becoming effective. Accordingly, when you access or use the Properties, you should check the date of the Terms of Use and be aware of any changes since the last version. Your continued use of the Properties following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Use means that you accept such changes. Your access to and use of the Properties will be governed by the Terms of Use in effect at the time of such access or use.  

2\. Other Sources of Terms and Conditions; Promotions and Coupons.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain provisions of the Terms of Use may be superseded by expressly designated legal notices, rules or other terms located on particular pages of the Properties, and, additionally in order to participate in or use certain services, promotions, discounts or coupons that may be run from time to time with respect to the Properties ("Offer(s)"), you may be required to agree to additional or different terms and conditions ("Additional Terms"). Some Offers also may be subject to additional requirements or restrictions imposed by us or participating third parties, such as the vendors or other merchants that issued, sponsored, or are associated with the Offer or the exclusion of merchandise from an Offer which shall also be part of the Additional Terms. Certain merchandise, shipping methods, costs or membership programs, and/or delivery times may be modified or not available in connection with an Offer. Your redemption of the Offer or use of such pages constitutes your unconditional acceptance of the Additional Terms. If there is an actual conflict between these Terms of Use and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms shall control and the non-conflicting provisions in these Terms of Use will continue to apply. For the sake of clarity, silence with respect to a particular term in either these Terms of Use or any Additional Terms does not constitute a conflict.  

If an Offer does not contain Additional Terms, then only these Terms of Use apply. Under these Terms of Use, unless otherwise prohibited by law, any Offer: (a) is valid only at the Property identified in the Offer and at no other store; (b) applies to in-stock merchandise only and not to gift cards or services; (c) is not valid for cash or cash equivalents; (d) is limited to one Offer per person, household, or address; (e) must be entered at checkout and/or in your account to be redeemed; (f) may not be combined with any other coupons or offers; (g) may only be used once; (h) expires on the later of one year from the date of issue or the date required by applicable law unless cancelled by us as permitted herein, and (i) cannot be reproduced, modified, sold or traded or used to pay any tax, such as sales tax, shipping, handling or any value added service. In addition, some Offers may be in the form of a voucher. If you purchase a voucher with a promotional value beyond the amount paid, you may redeem the voucher for the promotional value until the expiration date, or for the amount paid after the end of the applicable promotional period. We reserve the right to limit, change, or cancel any Offer or associated order, without prior notice, even after you have attempted to redeem the Offer or placed your associated order.

* Any automated use of any system, such as using scripts to alter content;

* Using the Properties in a manner inconsistent with any applicable law, rule or regulation.

5\. FanCash.
------------

FanCash is a loyalty discount redeemable only toward future purchases on the Properties or, at our discretion, certain other websites operated by us or one of our affiliates. When you make a purchase, no additional consideration is required from you to obtain FanCash but in order to obtain FanCash, you must create and maintain a customer account registered with a valid email address and check out while logged into that account on one of the websites, which is then offering FanCash. To earn and redeem FanCash you must create and maintain a customer account registered with a valid email address and check out while logged into that account on one of our websites which is then offering FanCash. If you check out as a guest, you will not earn or be able to redeem FanCash even if you have an account. Registered users logged into their accounts at checkout will automatically earn one (1%) percent FanCash on all eligible merchandise purchases and have any existing balance applied as a discount on their eligible merchandise purchase. All merchandise (including sale and promotional items) is eligible for earning FanCash, excluding gift cards. If you return merchandise for which you earned FanCash, that FanCash will be deducted from your FanCash balance. When you login to your account, you may view your FanCash balance (which will be applied automatically toward the next purchase) and you will also be able to see which websites are currently offering FanCash. Unless required by law, FanCash is not redeemable for cash, and cannot be transferred, sold or distributed to others and cannot be applied to shipping, expenses or sales taxes. You will receive periodic emails about your FanCash balances and program news or promotions. FanCash expires as follows: FanCash expires at 11:59 PM EST three hundred sixty-five (365) days (i.e., one (1) year) from the date of your last eligible purchase or other qualifying transaction, unless otherwise specified at the time of earning and specifically excluding bonus FanCash. Subsequent eligible purchases or other qualifying transactions will extend the expiration date for all earned FanCash in your account (the “Extended FanCash”); provided, however, if you have been awarded bonus FanCash with an earlier expiration date, we will specify the expiration date at the time of earning and such bonus FanCash will not qualify as Extended FanCash (and thus will not qualify for the extended expiration date). By way of an example, if you earned $10.00 in FanCash on an eligible purchase made on a FanCash Platform on January 1, 2024, and you make another eligible purchase on a FanCash Platform on December 31, 2024, then the expiration date for your initial $10.00 in earned FanCash will be extended to 11:59 PM EST on December 31, 2025. We reserve the right to discontinue FanCash or modify the terms applicable to FanCash at any time. FanCash is a registered trademark of Fanatics.  

6\. Links to Third Party Sites; Advertisers.
--------------------------------------------

The Properties may provide you with links or other access to other websites, services, products or content of third parties, including the Other Platforms, as defined in Section 11 below ("Third Party Sites"). We have no control over, and do not necessarily endorse, any Third Party Site's services, products or content. You acknowledge and agree that you access such Third Party Sites at your own risk and are wholly responsible for making your own independent judgment regarding your use or interaction with the same. We recommend that you read the terms of use and privacy policies of each Third-Party Site that you access.  

7\. Privacy Policy.
-------------------

You agree to our collection, use and sharing of your information, including personal information, as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.fanatics.com/what-is-your-privacy-policy/ch-2349) ("Privacy Policy"). All provisions of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.fanatics.com/what-is-your-privacy-policy/ch-2349) are incorporated by reference herein.  

8\. Products, Content and Specifications.
-----------------------------------------

The inclusion of any products or services on the Properties does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any particular time or that the listed attributes are accurate or complete. The actual color of products you see will depend in part on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee any color or texture or detail of actual products will be accurate. We do not endorse and have not verified the accuracy or reliability of any opinion or statement made on the Properties by any third party, including but not limited to customers, manufacturers, distributors or suppliers of products and services sold through the Properties, and product packaging and material may contain additional or different information. Always read labels, warnings, directions or other materials provided with the product before using. In addition, we may make changes to information about price, availability or other product attributes without notice. In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error or error in pricing or other information, we will have the right to cancel orders of any such product, whether or not the order has been confirmed and/or your credit card or other payment method has been charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, we will refund any such charges within a commercially reasonable period of time after cancellation (the time it takes for your financial institution to process the refund may vary and is governed by your agreement with them).  

9\. Placing an Order; Limitations; Order Acceptance.
----------------------------------------------------

By placing an order, you agree that the products ordered are legal to possess and use where you intend to possess and use them and will be possessed or used only in a lawful manner, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including copyright law and that you have the right to use any payment method that you provide to use. You may not order products with the intent to resell them.  

We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service, to refuse service to any customer, or to cancel any order, for any reason including after it is submitted. We also may require additional verifications or other information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order. Your receipt of an order confirmation from us does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We accept your order only upon shipment of the product. With respect to the shipment of products and services sold through the Properties, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Properties pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments. It also is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession or use of any item purchased from the Properties.  

If you complete your purchase and specify shipment to a Canadian or other international address, you agree and acknowledge that you are: (i) authorizing Fanatics to engage a third party carrier on your behalf to manage the shipping and importation of the goods into that location; (ii) authorizing the third party carrier’s customs broker to act as your agent to transport your purchases across the border into that location, clear the merchandise with the applicable border control organization (e.g., Canada Border Services Agency), and process all applicable duties, taxes, and fees on your behalf; and (iii) authorizing Fanatics to collect an additional amount at checkout to cover all of the applicable duties, taxes, and brokerage fees to be incurred on your behalf, and to retain any remaining amounts as an additional fee charged by Fanatics to you for arranging for the importation of your order.

19\. Third Party Transactions.
------------------------------

Through your use of the Properties, you may have the opportunity to engage in commercial or other transactions with other users, vendors and other third parties. You acknowledge that all transactions relating to any merchandise or services offered by any third party, including but not limited to the purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery terms relating to such transactions, are agreed to solely between the third party seller or purchaser of such merchandise and services and you, and that you will look solely to such third party to enforce any of your rights. In the event of any problem with the products or services that you have purchased from a third party you agree that you will address such issues with the third party but all limitations of liability and other rights of Fanatics shall apply nonetheless. We may not have the ability to accept returns or refund the purchase price for any transaction you complete with a third party through our Properties.

21\. Governing Law.
-------------------

These Terms of Use and your use of the Properties will be governed by federal and Delaware law, regardless of the conflict of law provisions thereof and regardless of where you live or from where you access or use the Properties.  

22\. Arbitration; No Class Action.
----------------------------------

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. Use or accessing the Properties or Offers constitutes your acceptance of this Arbitration provision.  
**

As a condition of using the Properties, you and we agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action (collectively, "Claims") arising out of or connected with the Properties (except for small claims court Claims, if applicable) shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, for full and final settlement of such Claim applying the Federal Arbitration Act and other federal arbitration laws. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SUE OR GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT. YOU AND WE ALSO AGREE THAT (A) ANY CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, MEMBER OF OTHERWISE ON BEHALF OF OTHERS IN ANY PURPOSED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND NOT THROUGH ANY CLASS ACTION, (B) IF A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT ANYWAY, WE BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL; AND (C) EITHER YOU OR WE MAY SEEK A COURT INJUNCTION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. ARBITRATION DOES NOT INVOLVE A JUDGE OR JURY. Although court review of an arbitration award may be limited, an arbitrator is empowered to award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive relief or statutory damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek temporary or emergency equitable relief to enforce its rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.  

You may seek arbitration of a Claim by contacting our registered agent at: Corporation Service Company, 1201 Hays Street, Tallahassee, FL 32301. The arbitration may be conducted via telephone, written submissions or in person in a mutually agreed location. Payment of all filing, administration, arbitrator and/or mediator fees ("Fees") will be governed by AAA's rules. The AAA's rules are available at:  [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or call 800-778-7879 (toll-free) for instructions on how to obtain a copy. Unless the AAA arbitrator determines that your Claim was frivolous, we will (i) reimburse you for the Fees paid by you, and (ii) will not seek reimbursement from you for our attorneys' fees and costs associated with the arbitration. You and we further agree that an award and any judgment confirming it only applies to the arbitration in which it was awarded and cannot be used in any other proceeding except to enforce the award itself and any post-arbitration action seeking to enforce an arbitration award or action seeking equitable or injunctive relief shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the State of Delaware, or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration, if any: (a) the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within the State of Delaware (the "Forum"), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and we waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.

23\. Messaging Terms & Conditions.
----------------------------------

If you choose to participate in our Messaging Program, by providing your mobile phone number and opting in, you agree to our Messaging Terms & Conditions found [here](https://www.fanatics.com/mobile-messaging-terms--conditions/ch-3166).

24\. Miscellaneous.
-------------------

We may give you notice of certain events from time to time. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on the Properties or (if we choose to do so in our sole discretion) delivering them to you through email if you have provided us with your accurate email address. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms of Use and your account on the Properties are personal to you and may not be transferred or assigned. Our performance under these Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms of Use is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Properties or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. If any part of these Terms of Use is deemed to be illegal, invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall be unaffected and shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable. These Terms of Use, together with any additional terms and conditions or policies referred to and incorporated herein (including the Privacy Policy and/or additional terms applicable to various parts of the Properties), constitute the entire understanding between you and us. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms of Use apply solely to the extent permitted by law.
