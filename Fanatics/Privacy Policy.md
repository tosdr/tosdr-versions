-------------------------------------------------

We may disclose your personal information in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy, such as to:

a. Fanatics Family of Companies : We may disclose your personal information to our [Fanatics Family of Companie s](https://www.fanaticsinc.com/our-companies) , such as affiliates, parents, and subsidiaries for the purposes described above, including marketing. For example, our companies may exchange information about your interactions with our Services, your preferences, and inferences we may have drawn about in or customize our offerings and market our services to you.

b. The public or third parties when you choose to, direct us to, or otherwise intentionally interact with such third parties through our Services , such as:

i. Information you provide in response to offers from third parties through our Services.

ii. Information in product reviews, including your name or username, pictures you upload, and any other information you choose to include. Reviews that you submit to our Properties will be viewable to other users.

iii. Content that you choose to post or otherwise make available to other users or the public in connection with the Services or on third party sites.

c. Service providers : We may permit our vendors and subcontractors to access your personal information in connection with performing services for us, such as IT providers, internet service providers, and data analytics providers. We may also engage other companies to provide certain services, such as identity verification, email distribution, market research, fraud prevention, security, and, if you contact us using chat, messaging apps, or social media, monitoring and recording the content of any conversations.

d. Professional consultants , such as accountants, lawyers, and financial advisors.

e. Vendors that process your transactions , including your credit card issuer, a third-party credit verification company, the product handler, the delivery service, and vendors who may ship product to you directly from their warehouse (including drop-ship and print-on-demand vendors).

f. Entities that provide you with services or benefits : We may disclose your information to entities to provide you with services or benefits. For example, when you opt to use a feature independently controlled by a Business Partner, such as a pay-over-time payment system or single-sign in system, we may share your personal information to them with your consent. Similarly, when you participate in our FanCash program, we may disclose your personal information to Business Partners and other third parties to operate the program and allow you to acquire and redeem points.

g. Law enforcement, government agencies, and other recipients for legal, security, or safety purposes : We may disclose your personal information: (a) as required by law or legal process; (b) to anticipate, prevent, detect, and investigate suspected fraud, harassment, or other violations of any law, rule, or regulation; (c) to investigate suspected violations of any terms or policies applicable to the Services provided by us or our third party providers or our Fanatics Family of Companie; (d) to protect our, our users’, and other third parties’ rights, property, and safety; and (e) to otherwise establish, exercise, and defend against legal claims.

h. Other entities in connection with a corporate transaction : We also may transfer your personal information in connection with a sale, acquisition, merger, change of control, bankruptcy, joint venture, or similar transaction involving some or all of our assets. If required by law, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to notify you via email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by posting an updated Privacy Policy on our website(s) if such a transaction results in the transfer of control of your personal information to a non-affiliate.

i. Business Partners for their own purposes : We may disclose your personal information to third parties for their own purposes (“Business Partners”) or their service providers in several situations such as:

i. Advertisers, ad platforms and networks, and social media platforms;

ii. Leagues, teams, and other partners whose branded apparel, merchandise, and collectibles we sell or promote through the Properties;

iii. Commercial data partners to whom we make information available for their own marketing purposes; and

iv. Partners who work with us on promotional or sponsorship opportunities available through our Services, including co-branded products and services.

You may contact us to opt out of such disclosures in some cases (See “Your Choices” below). However, we do not control how Business Partners use and share your information once they receive it. You will need to contact such Business Partners directly for information about their privacy practices or to exercise rights you may have.

j. Other entities with your consent .

**5\. Wholesale & Business-to-Business Transactions**
-----------------------------------------------------

Fanatics also engages in business-to-business interactions, such as when Fanatics interacts with the personnel of our business partners, including vendors and business customers. We collect limited information about such individuals, primarily consisting of name, demographic information, basic contact information and professional or employment-related information (such as your job title, employer, credentials, professional affiliations, skills, and other professional information). We use such information to facilitate our relationship with our business partners, including marketing.

**6\. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**
-----------------------------------------------

Our Properties (and authorized third parties) use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about you, your device, and how you interact with our Properties. This section contains additional information about:

* The types of tracking technologies we use and the purposes for which we use them
* The types of information we collect using these technologies
* How we disclose or make information available to others
* Choices you may have regarding these technologies
* Types of Cookies and Tracking Technologies We Use

Our Properties and the third parties that we authorize may use the following tracking technologies:

i. Cookies , which are a type of technology that install a small amount of information on a user's computer or other device when they visit a website. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time. These may be traditional client-side or server-side cookies, local stored objects (LSOs), or part of backend server-to-server integrations.

ii. Pixels, web beacons, and tags , which are types of code or transparent graphics that contain a unique identifier. In addition to the uses described below, these technologies provide analytical information about the user experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on web pages.

iii. Session replay tools , which record your interactions with our Properties, such as how you move throughout our Properties and engage with our webforms. In addition to the uses described below, this information helps us improve our Properties and identify and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Properties.

iv. Embedded scripts, custom links and SDKs , which allow us to build and integrate custom apps and experiences, some of which may be developed by a third party.

a. Purposes for Using These Technologies

We and authorized third parties use these technologies for purposes including:

i. Personalization , such as remembering user preferences, authentication, login details and browsing behavior; tracking your activity across online properties and platforms over time to better understand your preferences and interests; and personalizing online content;

ii. Improving performance , such asmaintaining and improving the performance of our Properties and Services;

iii. Analytics , such asanalyzing how our websites are used. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us improve our Properties, performance and user experiences. Google Analytics may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners) ; and

iv. Advertising , suchas providing you with offers that may be of interest to you; conducting targeted advertising to you on our Properties and those of third parties; and measuring the effectiveness of our communications with you and advertising campaigns, including identifying how and when you engage with our communications.

b. Information Collected

These tracking technologies collect data about you and your device, such as your IP address, location (both approximate and precise), cookie ID, device ID, AdID, operating system, browser used, browser history and referrers, search history, and information about how you interact with our Properties (such as pages on our Properties that you have viewed).

c. Disclosures of Your Information

We may disclose information to third parties or allow third parties to directly collect information using these technologies on our Properties, such as social media companies, advertising networks, companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting, security providers, infrastructure service providers (such as to reduce delays and increase efficiency of the Properties based on your location), and others that help us operate our business and Properties.

d. Your Choices

Some of the third parties we work with participate with the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). The DAA and NAI provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners) and [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/) . You may also click on the AboutAds icon on advertisements and follow the instructions on how to opt out.

You can also refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our Properties’ functionality may be impaired. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies. If you change computers, devices, or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or browsers; or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives.

Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. At this time, we do not honor Do Not Track signals. Some browsers have incorporated Global Privacy Controls (“GPC.”) When a compliant signal is detected by the Properties, we honor GPC controls.

**7\. Data Retention**
----------------------

We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we have outlined above unless we are required to do otherwise by applicable law. This includes retaining your personal information to provide you with the products or services you have requested and interact with you; maintain our business relationship with you; improve our business over time; ensure the ongoing legality, safety and security of our Services and relationships; or otherwise in accordance with our internal retention procedures. Once you have terminated your relationship with us, we may retain your personal information in our systems and records in order to ensure adequate fulfillment of surviving provisions in terminated contracts, or for other legitimate business purposes, such as to enable easier future user onboarding, demonstrate our business practices and contractual obligations, or provide you with information about our products and services in case of interest.

**8\. Third-Party Websites and Social Media Services**
------------------------------------------------------

a. Third-Party Websites. The Services may contain links to other websites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links, you are contacting another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your information, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected through those websites or resources. We suggest that you read the privacy policy and terms of use of each such website.  

b. Social Media, Widgets and Open Forums. Our Services may allow you to engage with social media services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram ("Social Networks"), and widgets such as the "Share this" button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Services or which link from Social Networks to our Services ("Social Functions"), potentially including identity and messaging functions run by these networks. These Social Functions may access, collect, and integrate with your Social Network accounts and information. For example, these Social Functions may collect your IP address, identify which page you are visiting on our Services, or set a cookie. Social Functions may also be used to register you as a Services user. If you choose to use these Social Functions, you may be sharing certain Social Network profile elements with us, including your name, birthday (month/day), comments, contacts, email address, photos, or favorite teams.

This sharing is subject to each Social Network's own privacy policy and terms of use. We do not control those Social Networks or your profiles on those services, nor do we modify your privacy settings on those services or establish rules about how your personal information on those services will be used. Please refer to the privacy settings in your Social Network account to manage the data that is shared with us through your account.

Information you include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, or Social Network, or that you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or survey, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We do not control such uses of your personal information, and by using such services you assume the risk and acknowledge that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by us and/or third parties for any number of purposes and that the usage restrictions set forth in this Privacy Policy do not apply to such services. To request removal of your personal information from a blog, community forum or other publicly accessible part of the Services, contact us using the information in the Contact Us section. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so.

**9\. Your Choices**
--------------------

We strive to offer you with choices about how your personal information is used and disclosed. Some of the ways in which you may exercise these choices are described below.

a. Opting Out of Our Services.

i. Email: you can unsubscribe from commercial emails using the unsubscribe link, typically at the bottom of the e-mail. If you have an account with us, you may opt-out of some or all future unsolicited commercial communications by updating your account’s personal information settings (where available).

ii. SMS: If you have provided your mobile phone number and we have separately obtained your consent to participate in our SMS marketing campaigns on behalf of our ourselves or our affiliated entities, you may opt out by responding to a message with the keyword STOP.

iii. Referral: If you participate in our referral program, the friend you referred may contact us using the information in the Contact Us section of this policy to opt out of future communications from us.

iv. Mobile: On most devices, mobile application users may opt out of mobile communications from us via their device settings (mobile browser cookies require a separate opt-out, as explained below).

In addition, you may request that we delete your personal information by emailing your request to the email address in the Contact Us section, and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt, subject to our rights under the Data Retention section above. To exercise your privacy rights with respect to personal information held by Business Partners, please visit the Business Partners’ website(s).

b. Direct Marketing Opt-Out. If you do not want your personal information disclosed to any third party who may use such information for direct marketing purposes, then you may opt-out of such disclosures by sending an email to the email address in the Contact Us section. However, we are not responsible for removing your personal information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided with your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and any elections or privacy choices you may make with respect to receipt of certain types of e-mails or marketing communications from us will not apply to any such third parties. You should contact any third parties that send you communications directly with respect to choices that they may make available to you with respect to such communications.  

c. Setting Cookie Preferences. Most web browsers can be set to detect or reject cookies. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” or “Settings” menu of your browser settings to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you reject cookies, some features on our websites may not work properly. Cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.  

d. Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising. To provide you with more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on the website and on other websites. Some of these third parties may participate in DAA NAI programs, which provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at [www.aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/) and [optout.networkadvertising.org](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/). Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives.  

e. Location Data Opt-Out. In some cases, you may also adjust the settings on your personal device or mobile device to allow or restrict the sharing of location information. For example, the "location" permissions on your personal device or mobile device may allow you to elect whether to never share location information with us, to share location information only while you are using the Services or always share location information even if you are not using the Services. If you elect to not share your location information, you may be unable to access some features of our Services that are designed for mobile devices or that require us to confirm your location. Also, in the event that you prevent the sharing of location information, we may still estimate your general location based on the IP address you use to access our Services.  

f. Account Modification : If you have a Fanatics account, you may be able access, update, delete, or correct your personal information by logging into your account.  

g. Push Notifications . We also may enable our mobile application to offer automatic (or “push”) notifications. We will provide push notifications only to those users who permit such notifications. If you would like to opt-out of push notifications, you can do so using your mobile device settings.

**10\. Security of Your Personal Information**
----------------------------------------------

We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of the personal information submitted to us both during transmission and after we receive it.
