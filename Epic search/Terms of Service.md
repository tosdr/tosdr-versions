If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, do not click accept, do not install Epic, and do not use Epic. During the use of the Epic Browser, you may be given the option of installing additional components for other software providers. The installation and use of those components may be governed by additional license agreements. The latest Agreement under which your usage of the Epic Browser is bound will be available at [www.epicbrowser.com/tou](https://www.epicbrowser.com/tou) and [www.epicbrowser.com/privacy-policy](https://www.epicbrowser.com/privacy-policy).

1. **LICENSE GRANT.** Hidden Reflex, the parent of the Epic Browser, grants you a non-exclusive license to use the executable code version of the Product. This Agreement will also govern any software upgrades provided by Hidden Reflex that replace and/or supplement the original Product, unless such upgrades are accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.
2. **TERMINATION.** If you breach this Agreement your right to use the Product will terminate immediately and without notice, but all provisions of this Agreement except the License Grant (Paragraph 1) will survive termination and continue in effect.
