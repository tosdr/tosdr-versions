MusicBrainz Database
--------------------

The [MusicBrainz Database](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) is split into two components for licensing purposes.

Core data

The core data of the database is licensed under the [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), which is effectively placing the data into the Public Domain. This means that anyone can download and use the core data in any way they see fit. No restrictions, no worries!

Supplementary data

The remaining portions of the database are released under the Creative Commons [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) license. This allows for non-commercial use of the data as long as MusicBrainz is given credit and that derivative works (works based on the CC licensed data) are also made available under the same license.
