If you have any claim arising out of the Terms of Service against us, we strongly encourage you to contact our customer support team to seek a resolution. If both parties fail to reach a settlement within 30 calendar days after the first contact occurs, either party may refer such a dispute to the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board. The arbitration is to be conducted before a single arbitrator whom the parties jointly select. If the parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator, either party may request the Korean Arbitration Association to select the arbitrator.
