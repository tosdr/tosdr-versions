Forsta Privacy Notice
=====================

**Effective Date: 09 October 2023**

**1\. Introduction**

Your privacy is important to the Forsta group (“**Forsta**”, “ **we,**” “**us**,” or “**our**”). Forsta provides our customers with a wide array of tools so they can turn insight into stories that fuel action. **If you would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our services, please contact the customer directly.**

This privacy notice discloses the information practices for Forsta web sites (forsta.com, confirmit.com, dapresy.com, focusvision.com), our recruitment efforts, our relationships with vendors and partners, and our mobile applications (including AskMe, CAPI, Mobile Panel, SODA, and Confirmit Go), including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.

This notice applies to personal data collected about Forsta **customers, vendors, partners, web-visitors, registered account holders of our products, mobile app users, and applicants to positions at Forsta**.

**2\. When does Forsta process my data?**

There are two types of situations in which we may process your personal data.

**2.A**. For the **first type**, Forsta acts as on behalf of its customers, meaning we do not determine the purpose or means of the processing ourselves and instead our customers do (usually as a software-as-a-service (“**SaaS**”) provider for companies conducting data collection and reporting activities via the Internet or mobile apps). You may be submitting responses to web surveys or app surveys via mobile devices, and the template of the survey may state “Powered by Forsta.” or similar. Surveys launched by Forsta’s customers may be hosted on Forsta’s SaaS environments, or alternatively they may be hosted on the customer’s own servers. In this situation, Forsta is sometimes called the ‘data processor’ or ‘service provider’.

In these cases, please be aware that it is **our** **customers** who are initiating or performing the data collection, who determine from whom to collect personal data, and who define how to use the collected personal data. Our customers are often called ‘data controllers’ in such case. For more details about how a Forsta’s customer intends to use your personal data, please refer to the privacy notice of the Forsta customer from whom the email or the web survey originates. **If you would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our services, please contact the customer directly.**

In these cases, Forsta will process any and all personal data uploaded to or collected via the SaaS by our customers. However, Forsta intends to process such personal data with appropriate and adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized breach or use. For more information related to Forsta’s role as a data processor, please see **Section 3** below, “Forsta as a data processor.”

**2.B.** The **second type** of situation where we may process your personal data is when we interact with our customers, prospective customers, potential recruits, vendors, and partners, often through the Forsta websites. Forsta usually acts as the data controller in these instances as described in this notice. See **Section 4** below for more information about these situations.

**3\. Forsta as a data processor**

**3.A. Our role as a processor**

In relation to our roles as SaaS provider and data processor, Forsta processes information under the instructions of its customers and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data Forsta collects or processes on behalf of its customer.

If you seek access to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal data, or if you seek to invoke any other rights in respect to the personal data under applicable laws, you should direct your query to Forsta’s customer as the data controller. We will honor and support any instructions our customer provide us with respect to your personal data. If Forsta is requested by Forsta’s customer to take actions on personal data (access, update, export, delete or other as required), we will respond within a reasonable timeframe in accordance with applicable laws.

**If you would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our SaaS service, please contact the customer directly.**

If you have reached out to our customer and are not getting a reply, you may approach Forsta in accordance with section 6 below.

**3.B. Data storage, data access, data transfers, and data retention**

Personal data that our customers collect from you may, subject to adequate confidentiality undertakings, and _for the sole purpose of providing our customers with the services they have contracted from us_ , be accessed by personnel, contractors, and third-party services providers of Forsta and its affiliates. In any such case, the personnel granted access to your personal data will have been deemed by their managers to have a reasonable business need to do so.

Where Forsta transfers personal data to one of our affiliates or [sub-processors](https://legal.forsta.com/legal/forsta-sub-processor-list/), we will have legally compliant transfer mechanisms in place. See more details in **Section 4.F.** below.

For purposes of complying with data privacy laws throughout the EEA, Switzerland, the UK, and other jurisdictions, where Forsta transfers personal data to an entity which is outside of the EEA and in organized a jurisdiction which has not received an ‘adequacy decision’ or similar from the jurisdiction from which the data is being transferred, Forsta makes such transfers only if subject to an adequate transfer mechanism as described by applicable data privacy law, e.g., standard data protection clauses.

We will retain personal data our customers have instructed us to process for them for as long as needed to provide services to our customers in accordance with the contractual terms in our agreements with them. Our customers can at any time instruct for such personal data to be updated, exported, deleted, or as otherwise required. Forsta will retain personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and in accordance with our customer agreements.

**3.C. Security measures**

Forsta operates under a strong security and privacy regime. If your personal data is stored on Forsta’s SaaS environments, you are welcome to read more about how we protect your personal data by applying industry leading security measures and performing ongoing security tests and controls. For Horizons, please refer [here](https://extranet.confirmit.com/Confirmit-Horizons/Overview/security-features/) . For Dapresy, please see [here](https://dapresy.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/7000040738) . For FocusVision, see [here](https://www.focusvision.com/company/security/).

**3.D. Device information**

When you download and use mobile apps produced by Forsta, at the instruction of our customers we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and where applicable, the device identifier (or “UDID”).

The mobile apps do not require location permission in order to be used. However, our customers who are using our mobile apps in order to collect personal data from you may request that the mobile apps collect your precise geolocation. Should location be requested, you will be prompted by the operating system of your device with a message that the mobile app has requested to access the device location (please note that Android OS 6 or older versions lack of this feature). You can accept or reject that request. If permission has been granted, this permission can be later changed at any time under the operating system settings area.

Depending on our customers’ use of the mobile app, the mobile app may also use beacons or similar technologies as part of the survey taking.

**If you would no longer like this information to be used, please contact our customer directly.**

**3.E. Cookies and Tracking Technologies on the SaaS environment**

At the instruction of our customers, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, scripts, eTags, local storage (HTML5) or similar tracking technologies. These technologies are used on the SaaS environment to provide you with a better user experience, including to authenticate users of, or personalize the content on the SaaS website or online service. They are also used to preserve functionality in our SaaS platforms, such as monitoring of network communications, maintain or analyse the functioning of the SaaS website or online service, protect the security or integrity of the user, SaaS website or online service.

You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the SaaS environment.

We do not use cookies in surveys you are invited to take via an email invitation with a clickable link or via pop-ups or web intercepts, but our customers using the SaaS may launch their own cookies, which we may not be aware of. _**Please contact the company inviting you to access the surveys or reports delivered via the SaaS for information about their cookies.**_

**4\. Forsta as a data controller**

**4.A. Our role as a data controller**

The security of your personal data is important to us. We follow generally recognized industry standards and all legally required measures to protect the personal data submitted to us during transmission and once it is received. In general, you can visit Forsta on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal data about yourself, except that we may log IP address and geolocation. There are times, however, when Forsta or our partners may request additional personal data from you to serve legitimate purposes.

Forsta will act as a data controller where, for example, you visit our websites and provide us with your contact details to obtain access to resources, or where we store your details as part of our management of accounts you have with us in your role as a customer. As a user of our Services, Forsta will also act a controller in relation to how you use our software (e.g., how long used, which services used, etc.). Further, Forsta also acts as a data controller during recruitment processes (see section 4.Q below). Where Forsta acts as the data controller, you may choose to provide us with your personal data in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information such as your name, physical address, email address, zip code, resume, phone number, and additional contact information. We intend to let you know how we will use such information and seek your consent when required by applicable laws before we collect it from you.

You may at any time revoke your consent or invoke rights in relation to the personal data provided to us in accordance with applicable laws. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal data about somebody else such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have his or her permission to do so.

Forsta will also act as data controller when processing personal data for administrative and operational purposes related to our provision to customers of services under agreements we have with them. Processing of such personal data will serve administrative and operational purposes such as account management, product improvement, invoicing and financial reporting, data protection and cybersecurity, and complying with our legal obligations.

Forsta does not request the disclosure of special categories of personal data or sensitive data.

You may contact Forsta in order to invoke your rights as a data subject under applicable laws in accordance with section 6 below.
